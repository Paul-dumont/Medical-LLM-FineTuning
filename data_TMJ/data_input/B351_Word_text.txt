B351 
B351 is 57 years old and referred by Dr. __. B351 was in fairly good health prior to last year. She had some neck problems at that time, but nothing real significant. Her ankles bothered her a little bit. Although she had some minor displaced disks in her neck, they were not causing any significant problem. She had had problems in the past with her lower back more so. Last year, she had an abscess associated the mandibular left first molar. She had had a previous root canal on that tooth. She went to an endodontist and there was an attempt to try to reinstrument the tooth and redo the root canals. In addition, because pain continued, they performed a root canal on the mandibular left second molar as well. This did not really relieve the problem, and she developed an abscess on that side. When the abscess developed, the endodontist performed an I&D to drain the infection. She was placed on Clindamycin, but it may be a subtherapeutic dose. She continued to have significant problems with increasing severity of pain and the endodontist finally told her to go to the Baylor emergency room. She was seen by Dr. . He identified an abscess at the base of the tooth with some bone destruction. He recommended that the tooth be removed. Last year, teeth #18 and 19 were removed with forceps and tooth #19 curetted for removal of granulation tissue. She was placed on a higher dosage of Clindamycin including some IV application at the time of removal. She continued to have problems last year, she returned to the dental school with complaints of trismus. Incisal opening was 10-12 mm, but the patient had good excursion movements greater than 5 mm and good protrusion. She was diagnosed as having trismus secondary to pain. The extraction sites appear to be healing well and there is no evidence of infection. Last year, she maintained good jaw function relative to excursion movements and protrusion of about 7 mm to left and 3 mm to the right. Protrusion movements were about 5 mm. She was seen several other times, but finally on August 26, a second surgery was performed to remove granulation tissue from the extraction sites. Few weeks after, she was reevaluated and she was feeling better. By September 8, the patient still had significant limitation in opening. She said she had a funny feeling in her tongue at that time. Her incisal opening was only 15 mm at that time. She was referred for a neurology evaluation at that time.

Primary concerns that B351 has at this time include the following:
Cannot open her mouth. Chewing is difficult. She gets a feeling of choking. She has concerns about access to the throat and to dental issues as well as dental cleaning.

Basic medications that she is taking currently include the following:
Amrix 50 mg q.h.s. (new form of Flexeril).
Zoloft 100 mg q.d.
Omeprazole 20 mg (for acid reflux).
Estradiol 0.05 mg q.d.
CoQ-10 200 mg q.d. Hyaluronic acid.
B12.
Biotene.
Fish oil.
Calcium and vitamin D. Advil and Tylenol for pain.

B351's objectives are to be able to:
Open her mouth. Chew normally. Access throat. Floss her teeth and maintain good oral hygiene. B351 rates her headaches at a level of 0, although she did have some headaches when she had her abscesses. TMJ pain is at usually 0 but can escalate to 7, but this is usually when the jaws are stretched. Average daily pain is about 7 and that is predominantly in the neck area. She rates her jaw function at 4, diet at 4, and disability at 6. Other joints that bother her include her neck, hands, elbows, knees, ankles, and shoulders. Dr. Tunell evaluated her neck and did not believe that the slightly bulging disks x3 played any significant role in her pain factors. This evaluation was made on MRI that is 5 years old. She has been seeing a rheumatologist and the latest rheumatologist analysis of the ANA titer, which has increased significantly, was a titer of 2560 in a mixed pattern. B351 usually feels best in the morning relative to her jaws and can open best in the morning and then as the day progresses, the opening decreases. She has occasional snoring. She has moderate daytime somnolence, but she is not aware of any sleep apnea problems. She has a moderate sleep disorder and does have difficulties sometimes at night sleeping. She is predominantly a mouth breather.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
The maxillary midline looks pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is shifted about 1 mm to the left and the chin may be 2 mm to the left. Oropharyngeal airway looks clear. Intranasally, she has a fairly significant septal deviation off towards the right side with a spur extending over into the right side of the nose almost touching against the turbinate which is sort of moderate in size. The left turbinates are moderate in size as well. She may have some mild nasal airway obstruction. She does have a history of previous trauma to the nose when she got hit by a ball, and this may account for the septal problem. There is tenderness over the temporalis muscles and minimal tenderness over the masseters and right styloid area. She has some very mild tenderness over the right TMJ. Masseter muscles by palpation feel equal and relatively soft. Incisal opening is limited to 17 mm and even with trying to get her to relax we could not get beyond that. Excursion movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 9 mm, indicating that the limited incisal opening is not directly related to the TMJ medial displacement of the articular discs.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the mandibular left first and second molars. All four third molars are missing. She has root canals on the maxillary left lateral incisor, second bicuspid, first molar, and the maxillary right first bicuspid, second molar, and mandibular right second molar. She has crowns on almost all the posterior teeth except for the lower first bicuspids and the maxillary left first bicuspid. Sinuses look relatively clear. Condyles appear a little bit arthritic. The styloid and hyoid processes are elongated bilaterally. Waters view shows the nasal septum is reasonably straight, but she has a large spur going off into the right side of the nose. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Coronoid processes appear relatively equal on both sides. Right TMJ tomograms show a condyle that has reasonable morphology. Joint space looks fairly normal. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There may be a slight decreased posterior joint space. Left TMJ tomogram is a little bit harder to interpret. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space may be a little bit decreased superiorly. On opening, there is restricted translation in both joints. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B351 has a skeletal Class I relationship as well as a Class I occlusal relationship with about 1.5 mm of vertical over bite. Oropharyngeal airway looks adequate, although it is slightly narrow.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Decreased incisal opening with a limit at 17 mm.
Possible myositis or fibrosis affecting the left masseter muscle, left temporalis muscle, and/or left medial pterygoid muscle. Hypertrophied styloid processes and ligaments (probably not the causative factor for limited opening).
Significantly elevated ANA titer.
Bilateral TMJ medial displacement of the articular disc and inflammatory process.
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis with medial displacement of the articular discs and slight anterior displacement on the left side with inflammatory process in both joints.

B351 has excellent excursion and protrusive movements. Therefore, I do not believe that the TMJ is the causative factor for the significantly limited incisal opening.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Klonopin 1-mg tablet, 1 tablet q.h.s., dispensing 30 tablets, refill x4. Reevaluate in 1 to 2 weeks.
Consider physical therapy.
Consider possible I-CAT to look for heterotopic bone formation within the coronoid area, within the muscles, and to evaluate the styloid process.

Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic. There are some small indentations on the head of the condyle. Joint space looks reasonably good. It appears that the disc is medially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit healthier, although there is some sclerosis and the condyle does not appear to be quite as arthritic as the opposite side. There is decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 or 4 mm. The disc appears to be medially displaced as well on this side.

Left axial views show the condyles have fairly good mediolateral width.
Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good posterior width. There is a little depression in the head of the condyle with a small osteophyte sticking up probably posterior to the posterior band of the disc. There is small anterior beaking. The condyle is posteriorly displaced in the fossa with decrease posterior joint space. Articular eminence is relatively normal. The disc may be slightly anteriorly positioned. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc is not very visible, but what is seen is anteriorly displaced. There appears to be some erosion on the anterior aspect of the head of the condyle or at least a significant indentation.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good anteroposterior dimension. Articular eminence is moderate in inclination. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc is not seen. There is a little bit of discal tissue, but it is anterior to the condyle. There appears to be a small erosion in the articular eminence area. There is a little osteophyte sticking up off the top of the condyle behind the posterior band of the disc. More medially, the disc appears to be in a better anteroposterior position relative to the condylar head.

In the T2 images, right TMJ sagittal view shows decreased superior and posterior joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint where the disc, or what is visible just a small evidence of it, is anteriorly displaced. More medially, the disc is in a better anteroposterior position. There is a fair amount of fluid or a reactive pannus within the joint.

Left TMJ sagittal view T2 images show some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There appears to be fluid within the inferior and superior joint spaces. The disc is anteriorly displaced. More medial, the disc is in a little bit better position than it is out lateral. In the sagittal PD-FAT SAT, the discs are displaced bilaterally and likely medially displaced.

Open views: Right TMJ shows that there is some restricted translation of the condyle, but the articular disc reduces into position. On the left side, there is an osteophyte sticking up off the head of the condyle and there is greater restriction on the left side, although the disc does appear to reduce onto the disc, except at the lateral aspect of the joint the disc is not seen. It appears there may be some degenerative changes in the fossa as well.

Right TMJ T2 open views show some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces, but the disc is in a reduced position, but not seen at the lateral aspect of the joint. The left side T2 open views shows a disc that is still a little bit anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint and medially displaced. Joint space is decreased significantly vertically at the lateral aspect of the joint . More medially, the disc is a little bit better AP positioned, but there is significantly restricted translation of the condyle.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs predominantly medially displaced, but also anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint with the left side being worse than the right side. The right side reduces on opening, but on the left side it appears that it may still be out of position. In both sides, the discs appear to remain medially displaced.
