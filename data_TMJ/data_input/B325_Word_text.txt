B325 
B325 is 30 years old and referred by Dr. __.
Patient History
B325 is in good health. She just gave birth to her third child 11 weeks ago. This is her third son. B325 has no problems with earaches or tinnitus but does get vertigo. She has no hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She can't wear cheap jewelry, and also she has an allergy to HEB bread. She also had a reaction to one type of soap that she doesn't know what it was, but it was at a hospital. She claims that she gets numbness in the right side of her head occasionally.

Currently she takes AcipHex, ibuprofen, and Advil Migraine.
Her TMJ problems began around the age of 18. She was involved in two motor vehicle accidents during that time, and in one of the accidents she hit her chin on the steering wheel, and in the other she hit the side of her head and jaw area. She has constant headaches at a level of 2, but they can easily escalate to 10. She does rate in the last couple weeks that her headaches have been at about a level of 8 in the temporal and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 8. On an average day, her pain levels may be as low as 2 but can escalate up to 10. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 5 and disability at 4.

Patient Concerns
Headaches Pain in the jaws and jaw joints
Difficulties eating and chewing
Limited jaw opening
Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B325 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Some slight asymmetry in the chin with the mandible being shifted just a little bit off toward the right side a couple of millimeters.

In profile, B325 has good facial balance. Chin-neckline is a little bit full in the submental area. Could be just some slight AP mandibular deficiency but not too significantly.

Intraorally, B325 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. A little bit of an accentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch. She has adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth except she does have a high labial frenulum between the central incisors. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Slight reverse curve of occlusion in the upper arch. She has an anterior deep-bite of about 4 to 5 mm. She has a slight Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally of about 2 mm on the right and a millimeter on the left. Has a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 2 mm higher than the left side in the upper arch, and in the lower arch, it is about a millimeter higher with the right side being higher.

Maximal incisal opening is 25 mm. Opening without significant discomfort was 17 mm. Excursive movement to the right was 4 mm and to the left 5 mm. recently, B325 was having a root canal done on the mandibular right first molar. At the end of the treatment, she developed severe muscle spasms, and the endodontist was unable to get the bite block out. She had to go to an oral surgeon to be sedated to remove the bite block. The MRI was taken and the displaced disc identified. She then had an arthrocentesis performed to both TMJs without resolution of the problems. She has had two splints made that have not been able to fix the problem. The splint has helped some, and it has enabled her to open her jaws a little bit more than when she goes without the splint. She also stays on a soft diet because of the associated pain problems.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has root canals on bilateral mandibular first molars and maxillary right first molar. Nasal airway looks good. Left sinus appears a little bit cloudy compared to the right side. Appears to be some mild arthritic kind of changes in the joints with the right side being worse than the left side. No other significant pathology noted.

Waters view shows that the sinuses for the most part are fairly clear. Nasal airway looks okay. Some mild jaw asymmetry is noted with the right side being vertically shorter than the left side.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a joint that has arthritic changes in it. Joint space actually looks fairly good superiorly and posteriorly. Decreased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Some anterior beaking is present. Cortical bone in the joint appears may be a little bit rough.

Right TMJ tomogram shows significant osteoarthritic changes with significant flattening of the head of the condyle and some major anterior beaking present. May have been some resorption in this joint which may account for some of the slight facial asymmetry that is present. Posterior joint space is decreased, but superior joint space looks actually increased at the levels of the cuts. Open views show minimal translation of the joints with a little bit greater translation in the right joint as compared to the left. Both exhibit anterior beaking characteristics. Right joint appears there may be some osteophytic formation on the superoposterior aspect of the condylar head and perhaps also anteriorly.

Cephalometrically, she is fairly close to being Class I skeletal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks relatively normal. When closing the jaws together, B325 feels the front teeth hit first then the right posterior teeth then the left posterior teeth. She often wakes up with her headaches in the morning which would be indicative of nocturnal clenching or bruxism. There is a very mild tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of about 1 mm.

Basic Diagnoses
Severe bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations without reductions with adhesions to the articular eminences and severe deformation
AP mandibular hypoplasia
Right vertical maxillary deficiency and asymmetry
Mandibular asymmetry probably due to greater condylar resorption on the right side as compared to the left side
Slight Class II end-on occlusal relationship
Slight accentuated curve of occlusion, lower arch
Slight reverse curve of occlusion, upper arch
Anterior deep bite
Mild tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of 1 mm
Headaches TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Probable nocturnal clenching

Recommended Treatment
Medications
Klonopin 0.5 mg tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s.
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing about a millimeter of tooth structure to correct for the mild tooth-size discrepancy

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ condylectomy, debridement, reconstruction, and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses
Bilateral fat grafts to TMJs (harvested from abdomen)
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to transversely and vertically lower the maxilla

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B325  MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of :
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with extremely wide mediolateral width. Significant downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Significantly decreased joint space vertically and particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. There appears to be some discal tissue medially and anteriorly to the condyle. Cortical bone appears to be intact for the most part on the condylar head, although there may be some irregularities in it. Fossa appears to be intact.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Fossa appears to be intact. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Significantly decreased vertical and particularly lateral joint spaces. Difficult to identify discal tissue, although there is evidence that there may be some anteriorly positioned.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has some flattening of the anterior head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. Decreased vertical and posterior joint spaces. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced with significant deformation. Disc appears to be sitting in some areas below the articular eminence. Articular eminence is steep out laterally and more shallow toward the medial side of the joint. Out laterally, hardly any discal tissue is identifiable and appears to be more medially displaced.

On opening, there is severe restriction of translation, and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some flattening of the anterior head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. Decreased posterior joint space and superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep but becomes a little bit more shallow toward the medial aspect of the joint. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed.

On opening, there is virtually no translation of the condyle, and the articular disc does remain anteriorly displaced.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and possible closed lock situation
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and possible closed lock situation
