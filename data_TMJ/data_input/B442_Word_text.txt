B442
B442 is 21 years old and is referred by Dr. XXXX. B442's TMJ problems began when she was about 19 years of age of unknown etiology. She was having some problems with high blood pressure. This was in the summer two years ago. Later in the summer, she developed clicking and popping in the right TMJ. She received a splint approximately last year and has had it for about a year now. The splint did start to help but does not seem to help much anymore. B442 has had previous orthodontics beginning in the 6th grade and she finally got them off somewhere around the 11th grade.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
TMJ pain.
Headaches. Teeth do not fit together very well.
Daytime tiredness.
Difficulties eating and chewing.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: In frontal view, B442 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. A little bit more fullness on the right side of the face. A little bit of masseteric hyperplasia on the right side. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Upper lip is pretty much on the facial midline although the nasal tip may be off to the left side 1 to 2 mm. Maxillary midline is 2 mm off to the left side but mandibular and chin midline appear to be pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 2 mm. There is some AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 3 to 4 mm. Chin appears to be retruded by about 10 mm. Intraorally, B442 has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has some very minimal crowding. Some very thin attached gingiva around the lower incisors. In the upper arch she is missing a bicuspid which may account for the maxillary midline being shifted off towards the left side. She has a Class II cuspid relationship on the right side by probably 3 mm and Class III cuspid on the left side by about 2 mm. She has a posterior cross bite on the left side and tendency towards the right side. She has about a 1 mm anterior open bite. It appears the missing maxillary tooth is a first bicuspid. Uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal. Tonsils appear large and appear to cause some fairly significant constricture of the faucial pillars. She has had previous septal surgery but there is still just a slight residual deflection in the septum towards the left side towards the anterior part of the nose. Turbinates appear mild to moderate in size. Tooth size analysis shows a Bolton's difference of about 1.5 mm. To palpation, B442 has moderate pain over the right masseter, right TMJ, right styloid area, right SCM and mild tenderness over the shoulders that she relates to tubing this weekend. On opening, the left joint seems to function relatively smoothly. The right joint has a definite audible pop at about 15 to 18 mm of opening and a closing pop about 10 mm. The popping is consistent. She has also has a consistent pop in the right TMJ. Maximal incisal opening is 45 mm. Opening without much discomfort is 18 mm. Excursive movement to the right 9 mm, left 7 mm. As she goes to the left she does have a definite pop also in the right joint. B442 rates her TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 4, diet at 5, disability at 3. Headaches are a level of 7 in the right temporal area and in the posterior head area. The right shoulder bothers her and no other joints are involved.

She gets occasional right earaches but no tinnitus or vertigo or hearing loss. She is not aware of clenching, although she does wake up fairly consistently with headaches in the morning.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of mandibular third molars and the presence of impacted maxillary third molars. Maxillary left first bicuspid appears to be missing. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Waters view shows that the bony septum at least appears fairly straight. Turbinates are moderate in size. The sinuses appear clear.
Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good shape to it. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Joint space, however, appears reasonably well balanced although it appears a little bit decreased in one of the views at the superoposterior aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with some flattening on the posterior head. Articular eminence is quite steep. Condyle appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa with increased anterior joint space. There is moderate translation of both joints.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B442 has retrusion in the maxilla and mandible. The oropharyngeal airway at the base of the soft palate is less than 3 mm. At the base of the tongue the airway measures about 6 mm. She has an anterior open bite tendency.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
Left TMJ generally appears stable.
AP maxillary deficiency. Transverse maxillary deficiency. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm (normal is 11 mm.)
Impacted bilateral maxillary third molars.
Occludes predominately on the right side. Hypertrophied right masseteric muscle. Class II end-on occlusion on the right side and Class III end-on on the left side. Anterior open bite. Bilateral posterior crossbites. Snoring. Hypertrophied tonsils. Maxillary midline deviated 2 mm to the left of the facial midline and mandibular midline. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1.5 mm. Right-sided headaches.

B442
Right TMJ pain. Right-sided myofascial pain.
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Medications.
Klonopin 1 mg q.h.s. to try to control nocturnal clenching and eliminate her morning headaches. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Be sure lateral incisor roots are tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally for interdental osteotomies. Open up ½ mm space around each upper lateral incisor to correct for the tooth size discrepancy. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Right TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance, expand and decrease the occlusal plane angle.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible. Surgical removal of maxillary impacted third molars x2.
Tonsillectomy. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have very good mediolateral width. Decreased superior joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 2 to 3 mm. Disc appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Joint space appears a little bit decreased. It appears that the disc is medially displaced. Decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the fossa. The disc may also be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the anterior head. A little bit of peaking of the condyle. A little bit of anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep and somewhat elongated. Disc is anteriorly dislocated at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially the disc is in a little bit better position. This is probably indicative of a rotational displacement of the articular disc. There is fluid in the superior joint space posterior to the condyle and a little bit anterior as well. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to reduce.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the posterior aspect of the condyle. Articular eminence is fairly steep and somewhat elongated. The disc is anteriorly displaced and in a vertical orientation within the joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the inferior joint space. On opening, there is fairly good translation and the disc does reduce with good translation of both the condyle and disc.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis articular disc dislocated in an anterior rotational position. Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated.
