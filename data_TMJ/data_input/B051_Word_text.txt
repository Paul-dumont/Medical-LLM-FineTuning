B051
B051 is 18 years 11 months of age. Primary concerns are:
An open bite has developed.
Teeth no longer match up properly.
B051 became aware that her bite had changed or was shifting about a year ago. Her dentist brought it to her attention. She was busy her senior year in high school and did not have time to do much about it and is now here for evaluation. She had orthodontic treatment from the age of 13 to 15 by Dr. XXXX. She had her lower wisdom teeth removed three years ago.

She gets headaches about once or twice a month at about a level of 4 in the temporal area. She rates her TMJ pain at 0, average daily pain at 0, jaw function at 3, diet at 0, and disability at 0. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She may clench some at night, but she is not sure. Her teeth are sore in the mornings, but she just got some new retainers from Dr. XXXX. She has no history of snoring, daytime somnolence, or sleep apnea. She does breathe through her mouth at nighttime and apparently some during the day. She tends to sleep on her stomach.

In frontal view, she has fairly good vertical facial balance. Upper lip length is about 29 mm, upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. She has some slight increased fullness in the right side of probably 3 to 4 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline and chin. The nasal tip may be just slightly off to the right side about 2 mm. In profile view, the maxilla may be about 2 to 3 mm AP deficient. The chin is probably about 10 mm AP deficient. The chin neckline is a little bit short and she has some fullness in the submental area. Intraorally, B051 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has a little bit of crowding in the lower anterior arch, but has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, B051 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She appears to have an accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. She has an anterior open bite of 2 mm. She is probably 3 mm Class II. B051 has a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 1 to 1.5 mm higher than the right side. The right eye is 1 to 2 mm higher than the left eye. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Uvula is relatively normal, but has a slight tendency towards being a bifed. Fascial pillars may be mildly constricted and tonsils are mild to moderate in size. Intranasally, the turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The septum deviates a little bit to one side than the other but not too significantly. To palpation, B051 has no pain around the head and neck area. The left joint functions reasonably smoothly, but there is a little bit of crepitation in the right joint area. The maximal opening is 44 mm, excursion movement to the right 10 mm, to the left 8 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the mandibular third molars, but the upper third molars are impacted with incomplete root formation. The rest of the teeth are present. The condyles appear a little bit small on the left side and appearing little more arthritic on the left side. She appears to be occluding on her second molars with all other teeth out of occlusion.

Coronal view shows that the septum is deviated off to the left side in the bony area. The turbinates are moderately enlarged with narrow airway. Sinuses look clear.

Axial view shows that the turbinates appear moderately enlarged and actually fill most of the airway. The sinuses are clear.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is postured forward a little bit in the fossa. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence has mild to moderate inclination. Out laterally, there appears to be some flattening of the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to be postured forward. Out laterally, the condylar head is quite flattened. More towards the center of the joint, there is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle and a little bit of anterior beaking. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Left TMJ coronal view show a condyle that does have some arthritic changes. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space and particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows that there is decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. The condyle appears it has lost some vertical dimension.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the man appears to be retruded. Her head is tipped upwards and forwards, but still her oropharyngeal airway is only about 4 mm at the soft palate level and probably about 7 mm at the base of the tongue.

By history, B051 had no problems with anterior open bite before treatment or after completion of treatment orthodontically. Dr. XXXX reviewed her models and photographs and x-rays with she and her parents.

Basic diagnoses for B051 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ adolescent internal condylar resorption (AICR).
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion.
Anterior open bite.
Facial asymmetry with a yaw towards the right side of approximately 3 mm.
In centric relation occluding only on the right first and second molars.
Hypertrophied turbinates creating nasal airway obstruction. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Impacted maxillary third molars x2.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Place a slight stop in the arch wire to align the four incisors in a slightly elevated level. Keep lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them too far forward and to correct for the tooth size discrepancy.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Bilateral maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. d.	Surgical removal of maxillary impacted third molars x2. e.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
