B492 
B492 is 32 years old and is a self-referral. His primary concerns are as follows:
Left TMJ issue getting worse. He has been told there are osteophytes and sclerosis formation.
Left TMJ pain. Pain and noises in the left side of the jaw. Concerns of long term effects.
Facial asymmetry.

B492 began orthodontic treatment 3 years ago in preparation for orthognathic surgery. Last year, he had maxillary and mandibular osteotomies performed by Dr. XX. Since surgery, he has had popping of his left joint and pain in his left jaw joint since that time. He gets headaches predominantly in the left posterior head area at a level of 4, left-sided TMJ pain at a level of 3, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 5, diet at 5, and disability at 0. He takes no medications. He gets occasional earaches, occasional ringing in his ears with no problems with vertigo. No other joints bother him. He does hit prematurely on his left occlusion. He is not aware of snoring, daytime somnolence, nor sleep apnea.

In frontal view, he has reasonably good facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 4 mm. Maxillary and mandibular midlines are pretty much on the facial midline. The chin is shifted a little bit towards to the left side probably 4 to 5 mm. In profile view, B492 has fairly good facial symmetry and balance. The chin neckline looks relatively normal in length and chin neck angle is well defined. Intraorally, B492 is missing the mandibular left lateral incisor and a second molar. On the right side, he has his teeth back through the second molars. In the upper arch, B492 has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has a slight Class III cuspid relationship on the right side and about 2 to 3 mm Class III. On the left side, he is basically Class I. He has about a 3 mm anterior deep bite relationship. As B492 opens up, he does shift a little bit towards the left side about 3 mm. To palpation, B492 has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, the right joint seems reasonably smooth, but the left joint has some crepitus kind of noises. There is a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 1.5 mm high to 2 mm higher than the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively healthy. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size and the septum is reasonably straight. There is actually a slight deviation of the septum off towards the right side particularly in the upper aspect of the nose.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of four bone plates in the maxilla. There are four bone screws in the right ramus and three in the left ramus. It shows he has a little condensing osteitis probably in the mandibular symphysis area and perhaps around the first molar position in the left side. The sinuses look relatively clear. It is difficult to evaluate the joints.

Coronal view shows that the right turbinate is fairly good size. The sinuses look reasonably clear with perhaps a little bit of fluid and thickening of the sinus membrane on the floor in the orbit.

Axial view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size and the right one appears to touch against the septum.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic and does have an osteophyte extending off the anterior head of the condyle. The joint space actually looks reasonably good.

Right condyle appears to have a little better morphology and less arthritic changes.
Coronal views of the TMJ show that there is reasonably posterior condyle. The vertical joint space looks good, but there is a decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has pretty good mediolateral width. There appears to be significantly decreased joint space at the lateral pole of the condyle.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has fairly good jaw alignment. Inferior border looks fairly well balanced. He does have some residual adenoid tissue left in the nasopharynx. The airway measures about 6 mm at the soft palate level and probably almost 10 mm at the base of the tongue. The tongue fills the oral cavity. He appears to have a good over bite/over jet relationship.

Basic diagnoses for B492 would be as follows:
Post maxillary and mandibular osteotomies. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc may be slightly anterior and medially displaced and with intracapsularly inflammation. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc with slight anterior and medial displacement but asymptomatic. Left TMJ pain.
Premature occlusal contact on the left side.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Medications: a. Doxycyline 100 mg tablets, dispensing 90 tablets, 1 tablet b.i.d. for 1 month and then 1 tablet q.d. for the following month. b.	Advil 2 tablets q.i.d.
2.	Therapy to improve jaw mobility.
3.	Reevaluate.
4.	Consider surgery for disc repositioning if the above methods are ineffective.

B492 MRI 
DATE OF MRI ACQUISITION: 
DATE OF INTERPRETATION:	 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has an abnormal shape to it. There is a large dip in the center of the condyle. There is a sharp projection out lateral. There is a medial extension of the condyle. The disc appears to be medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with minimal downward curvature.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is excessively wide. There is also a depression in the condyle area. The disc appears to be medially displaced. There is some decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat and more anterior it curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that had some arthritic changes in it particularly in the mid part and it is very narrow at the top. There is discal tissue that appears to be in fairly good position. The posterior band appears to be above the head of the condyle. There appears to be some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle coming beneath the articular eminence and the disc appears to be in position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of arthritic changes to it. The condyle is postured forward in the fossa it appears in some of the views. The disc appears to be in reasonable position, although the disc is somewhat thin in area. On opening, there appears to be moderate translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in position. There appears to be less fluid in the superior joint space on this side as compared to the opposite side. It is possible the disc could be a little bit anteriorly displaced towards the lateral aspect of the joint.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis, but articular discs that appear to be in reasonable position.
