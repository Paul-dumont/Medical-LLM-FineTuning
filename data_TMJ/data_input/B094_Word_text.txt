B094
B094 is 16 years old. She is referred by Dr. XXXX. B094 is in good health with no major medical problems. B094's problems began in about April 2010 of unknown etiology. She developed a close lock on the right side of unknown etiology. The treatment B094 has had so far included:

A minor equilibration.
An appointment with Dr. XXXX who was recommending splint therapy. Physical therapy which started 3 months ago and significantly reduced her symptoms.

B094 gets headaches maybe about once a week at about a level of 3 in the frontal and probably the temporal areas as well. She today has no TMJ pain. She rates her pain around the face and head area at a level of 1. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability all at 0. She gets right-sided earaches, moderate tinnitus, and occasional vertigo but no hearing loss. She has no other joints that bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She did have orthodontics four times with the first beginning about the age of 6 with a palatal expander. Her last orthodontic appliances were only for a few months, 2 years ago.

Primary concerns that B094 has include the following:
Lip incompetence. Joint problems. Open bite.
In frontal view, B094 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 16 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 7 mm. The mandibular dental midline and chin appear to be pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is deviated to the right side about 1 to 2 mm. The maxillary midline is about 1 mm off to the right side. The right eye is about 2 mm lower than the left one. She has a lip incompetence of 11 mm. In profile view, she has an AP deficiency of probably 4 to 5 mm and the chin is AP deficient by probably about 10 to 12 mm. She has a C shaped curve to the upper lip. The lower third face is somewhat elongated and she does have the significant lip incompetence. She does have a nasal dorsal prominence. Intraorally, B094 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. In the upper arch, she also has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has fairly good attached gingiva along the anterior teeth. She has just a slight Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the left side and right side by about 1 mm. She has about 1.5 mm vertical overbite. She has about a 1 mm over jet. To palpation, she has some moderate pain over the left TMJ and milder pain over the left retromandibular area. She appears to have a little bit of closing click on the right side at about 30, but cannot really detect much on opening. On the left side on opening, she had a very soft click at about 30 mm of opening and closing at probably about 25. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Intranasally, as best I could see, the turbinates look relatively normal in size and the septum looked reasonably straight. The maximum incisal opening is 53 mm, excursion movements are about 8 mm in each direction.

Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The turbinates appear enlarged, although the sinuses appear reasonably clear. It is difficult to evaluate the TMJ joints. Bony septum looks reasonably straight.

Coronal view shows that the septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. The turbinates appear significantly enlarged particularly on the right side. The sinuses appear clear.

Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The septum appears reasonably straight at this particular cut level and the right turbinate appears somewhat enlarged. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Joint space looks reasonably well balanced. The articular eminence is moderately inclined.

Right TMJ shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. The joint space is fairly well balanced. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have good mediolateral width. The joint space appears fairly well balanced, although a little bit narrow on medial side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

The right joint shows fairly good joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm. The condyle has good mediolateral width.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B094 has anterior vertical maxillary excess. Oropharyngeal airway actually looks fairly reasonable. She has some slight over inclination of the maxillary incisors. The lower incisors are also inclined. She has probably a moderate occlusal plane inclination. Basic diagnoses would be as follows:

Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular discs anteriorly and medially displaced.
Maxillary vertical hyperplasia and slight AP hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Hypertrophied turbinates. External nasal deformity.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisors roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Try to slightly expand the upper arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Try to slightly expand the lower arch.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral ramus sagittal osteotomies to advance the mandible and to move it superiorly. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly approximately 4 to 5 mm. d.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e.	External rhinoplasty.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B094 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. It appears there may be some discal tissue medially and anteriorly displaced. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm. The joint space looks fairly well balanced.

Right TMJ shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The disc may also be anteriorly and medially displaced. There may be decreased vertical joint space. The superior joint space appears narrow.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular disc may be slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, it may be in a little bit better position. Out lateral, the disc is not quite as evidently seen as it is more towards the medial side. The articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ has fairly good joint morphology with just some slight anterior beaking present. The disc appears it may be in a little bit vertical orientation within the joint, particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, she has good reduction and movement of the condylar heads.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular discs anteriorly and medially displaced.
