B332 I-CAT AGE: DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
The patient has had previous orthognathic surgery. She has four bone plates in the maxilla and three bone screws in each ramus area in the mandible. Panorex shows plates in the maxilla. Sinuses look clear. Right turbinate appears moderately enlarged. Right TMJ appears arthritic with loss of condylar volume while the left side looks somewhat larger. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch. She is missing all four third molars.

Sagittal TMJ view of the left joint shows decreased vertical joint space. Condyle appears to have reasonably good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Sinuses again appear clear. Oropharyngeal airway does look normal. The right sinus appears clear. Right condyle appears narrow anteriorly posteriorly and seems to have lost vertical and AP volume. There is decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Axial view shows that the turbinates are moderate in size. It may have an adequate airway. Right condyle appears small in size compared to the left condyle. Sinuses appear clear. Septum has a little curvature off towards the right side. Inferior turbinates are moderately enlarged.

In coronal view, the sinuses are clear and turbinates are moderate in size with the right side being larger than the left side. The right TMJ appears quite arthritic and flattened with some mushrooming of the head, although the unilateral width of the head is narrow and the superior joint space is very narrow. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is much larger, although there is decreased superior joint space, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint indicative of perhaps a medial displacement of the disc. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

IMPRESSION:
Right TMJ arthritis. Possible left TMJ articular disc medially displaced. Sinuses are clear. Turbinates are moderately enlarged.
Oropharyngeal airway appears relatively normal.

B332 CHASE
B332 is 35 years old, referred by Dr. __. She has had previous orthognathic surgery with both upper and lower jaw procedures performed. The only medication she currently takes is Imitrex as needed. B332 gets headaches that begin on the right side in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area that begin at about a level of 9. The left side is not quite as severe and probably at a level of 8. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 7, jaw function and diet probably around 2, and disability around 6. She has some residual dysthesia affecting the right upper lip, lower lip, and chin area. She has no earaches, tinnitus, gets occasional vertigo, but no hearing loss. She does have a single foot joint that tends to bother her. She is aware of clenching her teeth at night.

B332 is aware of aware of clicking and popping when she was in high school, but it was not particularly bothersome at that time. It was not until around 9 years ago that she noticed that her bite was beginning to change significantly. She has had previous orthodontic treatment one time as a teenager then again in her 20s to realign the lower teeth. 5 years ago, she began orthodontics again in preparation for surgery. The etiology of her situation at this time is unknown. 5 years ago, she had maxillary and mandibular osteotomies by Dr. __. Although it was recognized that there may be a joint problem, the TMJ joints were ignored. B332 has had several splints, in fact, three to four of them to date. She has also had chiropractic treatment, craniofacial treatment, and physical therapy without relief of the symptoms.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B332 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. She has some asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm and 4 mm on the right. The maxillary midline is probably about 1 mm off towards the left side. Both maxillary and mandibular midlines are about 1 mm off to the left side. The chin is a little bit off towards the right side, probably about 2 to 3 mm. In profile, B332 has some slight AP maxillary deficiency, probably about 2 to 3 mm. The chin appears to be AP retruded by probably about 10 to 12 mm. The chin neckline is short, although the chin neck angle is fairly well defined. There is some fullness in the submental area. Intraorally, B332 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. The teeth appear to be nicely aligned and leveled. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in. She has fairly good attached gingiva, although around the maxillary right central incisor the attachment is quite thin. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a slight Class 2 cuspid relationship on the right side by probably 2 to 3 mm and likewise on the left side she has probably got at least a 3 mm Class II occlusal relationship. However, she only has an overjet of about 1 to 2 mm. She has an open bite on the left side of 1 to 2 mm extending from the left incisor all the way around, through, and including the second molar. In centric relation, she occludes predominantly in the molar area on the right side and the rest of the teeth on the right are slightly out of occlusion. B332 has a transverse cant in the occlusal plane. Left maxillary cuspid is down about 1 mm lower than the right side, but the left mandibular cuspid is about 3 mm lower than the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Intranasally, the right turbinate appears small, but the left one appears enlarged and somewhat engorged. Holding the luminal valves open did not make any difference in her abilities to breath through her nose. She says it alternates from side to side at time as to which side she can breathe through. Today, she has significant difficulties breathing through the left side. B332 has about a 1 mm overbite on the average, but it is greater on the right side and less on the left side. To palpation, B332 has high moderate pain at a level of 6 in the TMJ area, moderate pain in the masseters, shoulders, and right retromandibular area. She has milder tenderness over the temporalis muscles, posterior neck, and left retromandibular area. On opening, she has a little bit of a glitch in the right joint. On excursion movements, she will occasionally have an audible pop in the right joint. Maximal incisal opening is 46 mm, but about 28 mm without significant discomfort. Excursion movements are about 9 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower anterior arch. She has got bone screws x3 in each ramus. She has got bone plates x4 in the maxilla with 4 screws in each plate. The left turbinate appears somewhat enlarged. Sinuses appear clear. Axial view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Fairly long screws were used and they extrude significantly into the sinuses. Left turbinate appears enlarged. Coronal view shows that the sinuses appear clear, but bone screws can be seen extending into the sinus. Left turbinate appears quite large and appears to occlude most of the airway on that side. The lateral turbinate is also is quite large. The ethmoid bones are not quite as clear on the left side as they are on the right side. Left TMJ sagittal view shows condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is a little bit of peaking at the posterior head of the condyle. Joint space appears fairly good, although decreased towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is small in size anteroposteriorly and also has significant loss of condylar volume in the vertical dimension. Joint space appears actually slightly thickened. Articular eminence is moderately steep.
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good morphology. Joint space is significantly decreased. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite arthritic. There has been loss of bone structure vertically and mediolaterally. Joint space seems a little bit thicker as compared to the opposite side. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B332 has a skeletal Class II relationship, although a Class I occlusal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway appears that there is moderate airway with an AP dimension of about 8 mm at the base of the tongue and probably 6 to 7 mm at the soft palate level. Vertical asymmetry is not quite as clear cephalometrically.

B332 apparently has had problems with Candida infections and also with black mold. She has been treated with special oils to treat these infections. She and her family went on for quite some time in reference to these special oils. I told her I had no understanding of them and I did not know what effect that would have on her surgery. She wants to stop the antibiotics as soon as she can after the surgery and start taking her special oils. Again I tried to emphasize that we need to keep her on antibiotics for at least a week to 10 days afterwards and stopping the antibiotics early could increase the risk of infection. They feel strongly that these oils will prevent her from having infections. Basic diagnoses for B332 would be as follows:

Right TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with significant deformation and nonreducing. Left TMJ medial displacement of the articular discs with reduction. AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia with asymmetry. AP mandibular hypoplasia with asymmetry. Class II end-on occlusion. Occludes only on the right second and third molar in centric relation and all other teeth are out of occlusion. Left-sided open bite.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Lack of attached gingiva around the mandibular right central incisor.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Periodontal evaluation and possible gingival grafting on the mandibular right incisor. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisors mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing approximately 2 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth size discrepancy. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Right TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Left mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomy to advance the mandible.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to transversely level the maxilla and advance it forward in a counterclockwise direction and to level it transversely. Right TMJ fat graft (harvest from the abdomen). Right mandibular coronoidotomy.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.

B332  MRI AGE: 35/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased superior joint space. The disc is displaced medially. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone some significant resorption with loss of volume. There is decreased vertical joint space. Discal tissue may be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is some flattening of the anterior head. There is a little sclerosis and perhaps a small osteophyte sticking up off the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderate in inclination. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced. It is not seen out laterally which would correlate to the medial displacement. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. Left TMJ open view shows that the disc appears to reduce relatively early on, but there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the articular disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost significant vertical and anteroposterior dimension. The condyle is anteroposteriorly. There is sclerosis on the top of the condyle. There is just a little bit of anterior beaking present. There is an osteophytic kind of formation in the superior aspect of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderate in inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space at the posterior aspect of the joint. Although there is fairly good translation of the condyle, the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced, but with reduction early on on opening. Right TMJ significant degenerative changes of the condyle with loss of condylar volume and with the articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction.
