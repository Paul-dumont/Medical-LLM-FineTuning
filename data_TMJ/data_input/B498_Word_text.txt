B498 
B498 is 46 years old. Referred by Dr. XXXX. B498 has had TMJ problems and clicking in her joints since about the age of 12. Etiology is unknown. She gets headaches on the left side that she describes as being behind the eye which would be the left frontal temporal level at about a level of 5. She rates her TMJ pain on the average day at 2, but it can escalate to 9. Average daily pain is at 7. Jaw function is at 5, diet at 2, disability at 3. She takes hormone replacement and occasional pain medication. She gets earaches in the left side, but no tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. She gets some pain on the right side down through her neck and shoulder area. Other joints that bother her include her knees, hips, elbows, fingers particularly the left index finger, and the wrists. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at night. She does snore and has some daytime somnolence. She is not aware of mouth breathing.

The primary concerns that B498 has includes the following:
Clicking and popping in the left jaw joint. Pain behind the left eye and down through the right neck and shoulder area.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B498 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary dental midline is shifted about 2 mm off to the right side, and mandibular dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the chin. In profile view, she has some AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 3 to 4 mm. The chin is retruded by about 12 mm. Chin neckline is short and the chin neck angle is moderately defined. Intraorally, B498 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. Teeth are fairly well aligned and level. She has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars, however, the upper anterior teeth are tipped significantly lingually. She has some _____ in the palate. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relatively bilaterally being about 4 mm Class II on the left side and probably 2 mm on the right side. She has an anterior deep bite of probably about 6 mm. She has a slight transverse cant in the occlusion with the left side about 1 mm higher than the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal. Intranasally, she has an enlarged turbinate on the left side, but on the right side the turbinate is small at least anterior. The septum is reasonably straight. The columella is wide and nostrils are moderately narrow. To palpation, she has some very mild tenderness over the left TMJ, left masseter, and the posterior neck area. On opening, she has a demonstrable click at about 15 mm of opening on the left side and on closing at 5 mm or less. The right joint functions smoothly. After the jaw manipulations, she had burning in her left masseter muscle area in the anterior midportion of it. PREVIOUS TREATMENT. B498 has had previous orthodontic treatment from about age 34 to 36 including the use of head gear. Orthodontics was done by Dr. XXXX. She also has had splint therapy x3. With the orthodontics, she did also have head gear treatment performed. The head gear actually was used when she was a teenager at her first round of orthodontics.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a root canal in the mandibular right first molar. Sinuses look relatively clear. No other significant pathology is seen. Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Frontal sinuses are quite large. The bone septum is reasonably straight, but there is a bone spur off the right side. The right turbinate appears small. The left turbinate appears fairly large. The left airway appears to be blocked. The right side could have some obstruction due to the large septal spur that is present. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have reasonably good morphology. Joint space looks well balance. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has more of a hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is quite steep and there is slight decreased posterior vertical joint space. The disc may be vertically oriented in this joint. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship and significantly lingually inclined maxillary incisors. Oropharyngeal airway is severely decreased with an airway of less than 3 mm at the base of the tongue and probably 5 mm at the soft palpate level. B498 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3.5 mm. Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Left TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction.
AP mandibular deficiency. AP maxillary deficiency. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. Class II end-on occlusion. Severe lingual inclination of maxillary incisors.
Hypertrophied left nasal turbinate.
Nasal septal spur obtruding the right nasal airway.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm (normal 11 mm).
Left TMJ pain.
Left-sided headaches. Sleep apnea symptoms. Significant tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3.5 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip maxillary incisors forward opening at least 1.5 mm of space around each maxillary lateral incisor. Tip lateral incisors roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Reduction turbinectomy on the left side.
Nasal septoplasty.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
4. Restorative dentistry to build up the crowns on the anterior teeth to eliminate the residual spacing generated for the correction of the tooth size discrepancy.

Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears fairly wide. Lateral pole extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There is decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.
Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a fairly broad condyle mediolaterally. The lateral joint space is a little bit decreased, but not as much as the opposite side, but the disc does appear to be medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly approximately 2 mm.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little sclerotic on top with some anterior beaking and a little bit of peaking. Articular eminence is quite steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced, more so at the lateral aspect of the joint as compared to the medial aspect. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc does reduce and there is moderate translation of both the condyle and the disc. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. A little bit of anterior beaking is present. The disc may be just slightly anteriorly displaced at the most lateral aspect of the joint, but more medially the disc appears to be in better position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc was in a reduced position. IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteromedially dislocated with reduction. Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc that may be slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint and also slightly medially displaced.
