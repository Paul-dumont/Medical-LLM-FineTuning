B417 
B417 is 26 years old, referred by Dr. XX. She has had previous problems with gastritis and cervical dysplasia. Previous surgery included cryosurgery for the cervical dysplasia and she has also had her wisdom teeth removed. She does have a current problem with anemia. She has a previous history of viral arthritis 2 years ago with bad pain in her ankles, knees and wrists. This lasted about 2 months and she was treated with Celebrex and has had no recurrences since with those joints.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Headaches.
Pain in the jaw joints.
Difficulty eating and chewing.
Teeth do not fit together well.
HISTORY: B417's problems began when she was about 18 years old to the best of her knowledge. She was involved in a motor vehicle accident at that time and sustained a whiplash injury. She does not know if this created her joint problems or not. She did injure her neck with a whiplash injury and was under chiropractic treatment for one year. Her joint symptoms became more significant. 5 years ago, she had a lower splint made that she wore for about 1 year. Initially, it seemed to help some but then her situation got worse. Dr. XX, an orthodontist, made the splint for her. She then went and saw Dr. XX, another orthodontist in XX. He made an upper splint for her that she wore for about 8 months but had no improvement at all with this one. She then went to see Dr. XX, another orthodontist in Oklahoma City and he did not really have anything to offer for her but did not want to begin any orthodontic treatment until the joint problems were addressed. She was then referred to Dr. XX who recommended beginning some orthodontic treatment for her.

She has had fairly extensive osteopathic treatment performed for about 3 years without any significant benefit. She no longer is receiving that treatment. She also has tried physical therapy and this did not help her.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Yasmin.
Topamax 100 mg and this has provided some improvement in her headaches but nothing real significant. Aleve that she takes for her headaches.

She gets occasional earaches and some tinnitus. No vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She does have some seasonal allergy type problems with pollens. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She gets some tingling through the facial structures but she also gets it through her extremities and this may be associated with the Topamax medication which is one of the side effects of that drug. She gets daily headaches at about a level of 5 that occur in the frontal, temple and posterior head area. They can escalate to 7.
 
She usually wakes up with headaches but then on some days they will subside and get better but then as the day progresses they get worse again. Headaches can escalate to 7. She rates her average daily TMJ pain at 4, average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 6, diet at 4 and disability at 3.

In frontal view, B417 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary and mandibular midlines are pretty much on the facial midline. Chin may be just slightly to the left a couple of mm. In profile view she has fairly reasonable facial balance and perhaps some slight AP deficiency but not real significant. B417 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some moderate crowding in the lower anterior arch of probably 4 to 5 mm. She has an accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has small upper lateral incisors. Slight division II occlusal relationship. She basically, however, has a Class I cuspid, Class I molar. She has an anterior deep bite of about 2 to 3 mm. Oropharynx appears clear. The uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal. The faucial pillars are slightly constricted but not too significant. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal size. She has a septal spur anteriorly off the right side of the nose that blocks the airway slightly but there is still passable airway. B417 believes that she may snore on occasion. She has some moderate daytime somnolence. She does not believe it is related to the Topamax. She is not aware of any sleep apnea problems. To palpation, she has some mild to moderate tenderness over the TMJs but no other tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, she has a soft click in the right joint about 10 mm of opening and closing at probably 5 or less. On the left side she has an audible click about 30 mm of opening and soft closing click of probably about 10 mm. She says she can feel some grinding kind of noises in both joints if she opens and closes. This would be compatible to the findings on the MRI of the decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint between the condyle and lateral rim of the fossa. Maximal incisal open is 48 mm, opening without significant discomfort 37 mm. Excursive movement to the right 8 mm to the left 10 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars but all the rest of the teeth are in place. The sinuses look relatively clear. The condyles have relatively normal morphology.

Waters view shows that there is a little bit of deviation to the right of the bony nasal septum with perhaps a spur off that right side as well. The turbinates are moderate in size. The airway appears passable at least back in the bony area of the septum. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows there appears to be a little flattening in the posterior head of the condyle and some anterior beaking of the condyle. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep.
 
Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little more of a hockey stick shape to it. There appears to be decreased superior and posterior joint space with some flattening on the posterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep on this side. Some flattening on the anterior head of the condyle appears to be present as well. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles with the right one showing greater translation as compared to the left side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B417 has basically a Class I skeletal and perhaps a slight Class II occlusal type relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks relatively normal. She has a vertical overbite of about 3 mm. The cervical spine appears quite straight and vertical. Dental model analysis shows that she has basically a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side and a slight Class II cuspid relationship on the left side by probably 2 to 3 mm. She has small upper lateral incisors and some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch. B417 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of almost 4 mm.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction on the right and late reduction on the left. There are significant degenerative changes of the left articular disc.
Relative mandibular hyperplasia. TMJ pain. Headaches.
Facial pain.
Masticatory dysfunction.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 4 mm secondary to small upper lateral incisors.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Open 1 mm of space around each of the maxillary lateral incisors to help correct for the tooth size discrepancy.
Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2 mm of tooth structure to help correct for the tooth size discrepancy. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors and possible discoplasty on the left side.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maximize the occlusal and create space in the joint to accommodate the articular discs.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion. Be sure to maintain the spacing around the upper lateral incisors. Restorative dentistry to bond the upper lateral incisors to fill in the spaces making them a more normal tooth size.

B417 MRI Evaluation 
Age: 26/F
Date of Birth: 
Date of MRI: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. The lateral pole of the condyle is significantly lower than the medial side by probably 5 mm. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 4 mm. The lateral pole of the condyle curves out beneath the articular eminence. There is decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. I see no discal tissue in the joint space although it appears that it is anteriorly positioned. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. Significant downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa probably 4 to 5 mm. The lateral pole of the condyle is significantly lower than the medial pole. Significantly decreased joint space between the lateral aspect of the condyle and the articular eminence. The lateral pole of the condyle extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Cortical bone appears to be intact. The disc appears to be anteriorly positioned.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some significant arthritic changes. At the lateral aspect of the joint there is some significant flattening of the posterior head of the condyle and some anterosuperior beaking. There is anterior beaking of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting in front of the condylar head along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence. The disc is significantly degenerated. It is quite thick. It is significantly deformed and foreshortened anteroposteriorly. There may be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not of any significance. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the posterior head. A little bit of anterior beaking is present. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. More medially the disc is difficult to identify and is more prominent towards the lateral aspect indicative perhaps of some lateral displacement of the disc. There may be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc does reduce. There is good translation of both the condyle and the disc.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated without reduction and with significant deformation and degeneration.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated but with reduction.
