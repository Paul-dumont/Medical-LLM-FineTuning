B516 is not sure exactly when her TMJ problems started but at the age of 19 she had her wisdom teeth taken out and had significant limited jaw mobility for months following that. She was not aware of clicking at the time. This would have been about 40 years ago when this incident occurred. It was not until about 24 years ago that she began developing significant symptomatology with her jaw joints. She began splint therapy about 23 years ago following her jaws locking up when she would go to the dentist. About 21 years ago, she had orthodontics and then went back into splints which she continued to wear until about 12 years ago. She had orthodontics 12 years ago for one year. About 13 years ago, she had bilateral TMJ arthroscopy performed. It did give her some relief for awhile and then she went back into more splints and has been wearing splints since. Dr. XXXX treated her with splint therapy from 23 years ago for 5 years . Dr. XXXX treated her from 14 years ago for 6 years and then Dr. XXXX began treatment about 6 years ago and is continuing with treatment. She has had some physical therapy with Dr. XXXX, Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX. She also has had ionophoresis but this has not been of any significant help.

B516 has problem with earaches. She has constant tinnitus. She has more recently developed vertigo. She has some hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her neck where she has a spur on the C6, left elbow, wrist (carpal tunnel), back (sciatica), knees and ankles. She is aware of clenching at nighttime and also she is aware of it going on during the day. She wears her splints only at night. Wearing them during the day causes her agitation. She gets headaches in her frontal, temple and posterior head area at about a level of 7 and they occur daily. She rates her average TMJ pain at 8, average overall pain around the head and neck area about a 9, jaw function 5, diet at 4, disability at 7. B516 has severe problems with snoring and daytime somnolence. She is not aware of having sleep apnea. She has difficulty sleeping at night.

A lot of it is due to her pain and she tosses and turns a lot and has jerking. Her husband has observed her body jerking or jumping a little bit at night. She has elevated blood pressure. She has problems with tachycardia and irregular heartbeat. She takes Digitek and Diovan to control these problems and currently these problems are controlled.

In frontal view, B516 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. There may be a little bit of increased fullness in the right angle area and maybe a little enlargement of the masseter muscle on that side. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about ½ mm. Maxillary, mandibular and chin line are all pretty close to being on facial midline. In profile, she has fairly good vertical and AP facial balance. Intraorally, B516 has all of her lower teeth back through second molars. She has some crowns on her first molars. There is adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She is fairly close to being a Class I occlusal relationship. She has about a 3 mm anterior deep bite relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues look fairly healthy. The uvula may be slightly elongated but no too significant. The soft palate may be moderately long. Faucial pillars look relatively normal. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size intranasally at least in the front. Cannot see the complete back area. The septum may be a little bit off to the right side. She may have some nasal obstruction on the right side that she feels like it is blocked off. Columella and luminal valves appear relatively normal. To palpation, she has very high moderate pain to low severe pain around the right posterior neck, left styloid area. Moderate pain to palpation around the temporalis, masseters, medial pterygoids, TMJs (left worse than right), SCMs, shoulders, left posterior neck and right styloid area. On opening she opens fairly smoothly but on closing she has to manipulate her jaw from side-to-side and then she has definite popping noises in both joints about 10 to 15 mm of closing.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. Condyles appear large. Coronoid processes have a little funny shape to them.

Waters view shows that the septum is fairly straight. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size. Otherwise, they may be just slightly enlarged compared to the left side but the airway looks adequate on both sides. Sinuses all appear clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is quite steep and vertical in orientation. Articular eminence is long in vertical length. Decreased posterior and superoposterior joint space. Articular disc is probably in a vertical orientation and anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ tomogram has very similar architecture in that the condyle is a little flattened in the front and a little bit of peaking on the top and decreased posterior and superposterior joint space. Articular eminence is quite steep and in fact almost angles posteriorly towards the condyle and it is long in length. The discs are probably in a vertical orientation within the joint structures.

In both tomograms, styloid processes appear to be significantly elongated extending down and overlapping the posterior border of the mandible and is more easily seen in the open views particularly on the right side as compared to the closed view pictures.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B516 has a Class I occlusal relationship. She has a decreased oropharyngeal airway of probably about 3 mm at the soft palate level and probably 5 mm at the base of the tongue. The soft palate appears elongated. Occlusal plane appears fairly flat. The assessment profile shows that she has probably about 6 mm AP retrusion of the maxilla and mandible. B516 has had xerostomia (dry mouth) for at least 10 years. The only medication she has been taking long-term is the Synthroid and the Estradiol. All the other medications she has started more recently. B516 feels it is much more difficult to breathe through the right side of her nose as compared to the left side. Her bony septum is actually quite straight. There may be a slight deviation in cartilage septum. The turbinate may be a little bit wide posteriorly.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation with reduction.
Bilateral TMJ hypertrophied articular eminences. AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Hypertrophied styloid processes with calcified ligaments. Hypertrophied soft palate and uvula. Severe snoring. Sleep apnea symptoms.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral TMJ eminectomies.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible approximately 8 to 10 mm. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla 6 to 8 mm. Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP.)
Bilateral styloidectomies.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of an odd shape to it. The lateral pole of the condyle is much higher than the medial pole. Decreased superior joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the fossa. Relatively minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of only 1 to 2 mm at the most. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Discal tissue appears to be anterior and medially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view likewise shows a condyle where the lateral pole is higher than the medial pole. Decreased superior joint space. Relatively minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. Articular disc is anterior and medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes. There is some flattening in the anterior head. There appears to be a small osteophyte developing off the superior head going halfway across the condyle. Articular eminence is quite steep and in fact almost curves backwards towards the condyle. Posterior joint space is significantly decreased anterior joint space is increased. Out laterally, the disc is clearly anteriorly displaced and over medially it is in a little bit better position but still in an anterior position acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posterior against the posterior wall of the fossa. Posterior band of the disc is thickened. Somewhat foreshortened anteroposteriorly but not too significantly. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc reduces early and there is good translation of both the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes. There is a little bit of flattening in the anterior head in the mid part of the joint. The condyle appears somewhat narrow anteroposteriorly towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is quite steep and almost curves back towards the condyle. Out laterally the disc is anteriorly displaced and over medially it may be in a little bit better position but acting more like a wedge pushing the condyle posterior against the posterior wall of the fossa. Decreased posterior joint space is present. Superior joint space is decreased in some areas. Anterior joint space is increased articular disc is slightly thickened but not as significant as the opposite side. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening there is an early reduction of the articular disc and good translation of the both the condyle and the disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation anteromedially with early reduction but with extremely steep articular eminences. Probable indication for articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors with possible consideration for an eminoplasty.
