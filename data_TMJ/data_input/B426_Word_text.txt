B426 
B426 is 38 years old. She is a self-referral off the internet. Her primary concerns are as follows:
Right jaw spasms. Feels like a tugging sensation on the left side of the jaw.
Neck is stiff.
Limited jaw opening. Bite does not work or fit together properly.

She currently takes the following medications:
Levothyroxine 0.15 mg.
Yaz birth control.
Effexor 262 mg daily.
Trileptal 450 mg daily.
B426's jaw problems began when she was about 14 years of age. She had orthodontic treatment 22 years ago, but then had a relapse after that. I believe she likely had AICR that was unrecognized and untreated. 24 years ago, she had a rhinoplasty and a chin implant placed. She had breast lift and augmentation done 8 years ago.

She has no problems with headaches, but rates her TMJ pain at a level of 7, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 4, diet at 1, and disability at 3. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo. No other joints bother her. She has no problems with clenching or bruxism. She apparently does not snore nor have daytime somnolence nor sleep apnea symptoms. She is predominantly a mouth breather at night and also during the day. B426 does have some significant limitation of range of motion with her neck and it feels very stiff and there is some pain and discomfort associated with neck rotation. B426 does have a history of rheumatoid arthritis in her family. She has a sister who has rheumatoid arthritis and significant joint problems and also a niece who has rheumatoid arthritis and a lot of jaw joint problems. B426 does have a positive ANA test.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: In frontal view, B426 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is probably about 2.5 to 3 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is about 3 mm off to the right side. The mandibular dental midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline and chin is fairly close also. In profile view, B426 has some AP deficiency in the maxilla probably about 4 mm. Chin is retruded by approximately 18 mm. Chin neckline is extremely short and chin neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. There is some mild crowding of the lower anterior arch. She appears to have adequate attached gingiva in the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. There is a slightly Class II end-on cuspid relationship by probably 2 to 3 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of about 4 mm. Because of the severe retrusion of the mandible, it is very difficult to evaluate the oropharyngeal airway, but uvula looks just mildly elongated at the soft palate, probably relatively normal, but fascial pillars appear somewhat constricted. I cannot evaluate the tonsils. Intranasally, the septum appears to be deviated off towards the left side. Turbinates are relatively moderate in size. There is probably mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction due primarily to the deviated septum. Maximal incisal opening is 33 mm. Excursion movement to the right 3 mm, to the left 4 mm. To palpation, she has some moderate pain over the masseters, TMJs, posterior neck, and shoulder areas. When she gets her pain, it is predominantly in the TMJ area.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has root canals in the mandibular right first molar, left second bicuspid. There are crowns on the molars in the lower arch, second bicuspid on the left side, and maxillary right first molar. Sinuses look relatively clear. She has severe arthritic changes in both joints with the condylar heads essentially gone. She has very prominent gonial notching. Waters view shows that she has some deviation in the bony nasal septum, but it is probably clinically more so in the cartilaginous portion of the septum. The turbinates appear moderate in size. Sinuses appear clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows that there is extreme flattening of the articular eminences and severe resorption of the condyles. The condyles are functioning forward almost beneath the articular eminence compatible with CT/AI disease. Left TMJ tomogram shows a similar picture as the right side with loss of most of the condylar head and neck and with flattening of the articular eminence and the condyle positioned anteriorly in the fossa. On opening, there is some translation of the condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B426 has a severely retruded maxilla and mandible with a very high occlusal plane angle. She has a silastic chin implant present. She has a severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an airway dimension of only about 3 to 4 mm (normal 11 mm).

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis. Severe AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain. Myofascial pain. Class II end-on occlusion. Previously placed silastic chin implant.
High occlusal plane angle.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction down grafting the posterior aspect 12 mm. Bilateral coronoidotomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). Removal of previously placed chin implant.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

I feel this treatment plan will get her the best possible treatment outcome.

Date of Interpretation:  

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears quite arthritic. There appears to be a lot of sclerosis on the head of the condyle and the condyle appears quite small. It is difficult to identify. It is possible the patient may have had previous surgery that it makes it more difficult. There is pretty severe arthritis and not much joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better mediolateral width. There is significantly decreased joint space. Sclerosis is present at the lateral aspect of the condylar head. There are some small osteophytes in the lateral aspect of the fossa. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is severely arthritic. It is difficult to identify on imaging. What is left of it is very sclerotic. The condyle is positioned forward in the fossa. Articular eminence is extremely flat either from the disease process or possibly from previous surgery. It is possible there could be a reactive pannus that may be seen in one view. On opening, there is moderate translation. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is severely arthritic. The articular eminence is extremely flat. The condyle is positioned forward in the fossa. There may be some discal tissue anterior to the condylar head and beneath the remnant of the articular eminence. On opening, there is some translation. Most of the condylar head and neck appear to have resorbed. IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ severe resorptive arthritis with significant bone loss in the condylar head as well as on the articular eminence. Findings are compatible with connective tissue autoimmune disease versus previous failed surgery.
