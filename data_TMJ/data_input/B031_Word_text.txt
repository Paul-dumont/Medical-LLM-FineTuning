B031
B031 is 49 years old and referred by his sister. B031 is in good health with no major medical problems. History of present illness includes that he had no TMJ or jaw symptoms until he had a root canal done one month ago. It went very smoothly without any complication. However, after surgery, he was unable to open his mouth wide. It seemed to lock. He was put on exercises for a week and this did not do well. One week ago, he was put to sleep for jaw manipulations and the oral surgeon, Dr. XXXX, said that there were no obstructions in the jaw joint. He thought it was related to an infected tooth that had the root canal and perhaps a third molar behind it. It was decided at the same appointment to put B031 back to sleep and go ahead and take out the mandibular left second and third molars and the maxillary left third molar. This was performed without incident. However, this did not help B031's situation.

B031 has no problems with headaches, gets TMJ pain at about a level of 4, average daily pain at 2, jaw function at 5, diet at 2, disability at 3. He takes no medications. No earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo. The only joints that bother him are his knees. He is aware of clenching and bruxing at night. He does have some mild snoring and may at least part of the night breathe through his mouth. He just finished a round of amoxicillin last night.

In frontal view, B031 has good facial symmetry and balance. The midlines are fairly well aligned. In profile, he has fairly good facial symmetry with just a little weakness of the chin. Intraorally, he has all of his lower teeth back through the third molar on the right side and back through the first molar on the left side. The first molar is actually a dental implant. In the upper arch, he has got all of his teeth back through the second molar on the left side and back through the third molar on the right side. He has a slight Class III cuspid relationship bilaterally being about 3 mm Class III. There is a cross bite with the left cuspid and with the left central incisor. Maximum incisal opening is 25 mm, opening without pain about 20 mm. The excursion movement to the right is about 10 mm and to the left 5 mm. He has good excursion movements on both sides, a little limited towards the left side but I do not believe there is any TMJ issue there. He could protrude about 6 to 7 mm and was symmetric in his protrusion. Maximal incisal opening when he really forced it he could get to 30 mm, but this was very painful for him and the pain was in the anterior aspect of the masseter muscle. To palpation, I could isolate his pain and discomfort to the anterior aspect of the masseter muscle and I could actually isolate it between my fingers in that area.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of left maxillary and mandibular third molars and mandibular left second molar as well as the first molar which has been replaced with an implant and crown. On the right side, he has got a root canal on the mandibular first molar, but he has retained both maxillary and mandibular third molars.

Coronal view shows that the sinuses are reasonably clear with just a little bit of thickening of the sinus membrane on the right side. The septum is reasonably straight and the turbinates are significantly enlarged. Airway appears constricted.

Axial view shows that the septum is reasonably straight with just a slight deviation off towards the right side. The turbinates are significantly enlarged and could be causing some airway obstruction. Sinuses look relatively clear from this view.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and some slight beaking in some of the views. There is sclerosis on the head of the condyle. The joint space actually looks reasonably good within most of the joint, although it is somewhat narrow out lateral.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit flattened on top with a little bit of sclerosis. There is a slight tendency towards anterior beaking. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The joint space is fairly well balanced superiorly and posteriorly, but may be a little bit decreased anteriorly.

Left TMJ coronal view shows the condyle has fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. Medial joint space looks good. The disc is probably medially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with sort of an odd shape to it where the lateral pole of the condyle is significantly higher than the medial pole and it is more accentuated on this side than the opposite side. There is good joint space vertically, but it is decreased out laterally.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he may have just a slight Class III skeletal relationship. The oropharyngeal airway may be a little bit constricted.

Impression:
Left masseter muscle myositis.
Limited jaw opening.
B031 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There may be some decreased vertical joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim of the fossa has an inferior curvature of about 2 mm. The disc appears to be medially displaced. The lateral pole of the condyle is significantly higher than the medial pole.

Right TMJ coronal view shows that the condyle is wide mediolaterally. There is decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. The disc appears to be medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is some arthritic changes associated with it. Out laterally, the disc is not readily seen. More medially, the disc appears to be in reasonable position. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some mild arthritic changes. The disc possibly could be anteriorly displaced but difficult to tell. There is some minimal amount of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles and discs with reduction of the discs.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs medially displaced.
