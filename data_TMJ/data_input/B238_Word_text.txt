B238
B238is 23 years old. Referred by Dr. ___. B238's primary concerns are as follows:

Cannot open her mouth very much.
Pain in the left side of the jaw when eating or when sleeping if laying on that side. It is painful if she talks too much or sings.
There is some clicking on both sides sometimes when she opens and closes her jaws.

The only treatment she has had is a couple of years ago she was treated with steroids for her jaws. She received a night guard in about 2 years ago and continues to wear that today. The only medication she takes is Sprintec (BCP). B238 gets headaches about 5 days a week at about a level of 6 that occur in the frontal, temporal, and posterior aspect and also on top of her head. She rates her average TMJ pain per day at 7, average daily pain at 4, jaw function at 7, diet at 6, disability at 7. She gets occasional earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her knees and wrists occasionally and her left ankle which she injured last fall is somewhat problematic. She is aware of clenching and bruxing of her teeth at night.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B238 has good left-to-right facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 5 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much aligned on the facial midline. In profile, B238 has good facial symmetry and balance. She has an obtuse nasolabial angle. Nasal dorsum is somewhat short in AP length. Chin neckline, however, looks as though it is in good balance. Intraorally, B238 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars in both the upper and lower arches. She has basically a Class I occlusion with an anterior deep bite of 4 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. Tonsils are of moderate size. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged, but she has just some mild airway obstruction, but nothing significant and she does not report any problems with snoring, daytime somnolence, nor sleep apnea symptoms. To palpation, she has some tenderness over the right TMJ, but all other areas were normal. To palpation, she has mild tenderness over the right TMJ but nowhere else. On opening, she has a click in the right TMJ at about 10 mm and in closing at about 5 mm. Left joint appears reasonably smooth. Maximum incisal opening is 32 mm, but only about 20 mm without pain. Excursion movement to the right was about 5 mm and to the left about 9 mm. B238 does have a click in the right joint on excursion movements, but the left joint seems to function reasonably smoothly.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars, but all other teeth are present. Sinuses look relatively clear. Septum appears relatively straight. Turbinates are moderate in size, particularly on the right side, where it appears that the airway is fairly restricted. AP coronal view shows that the sinuses appear clear. The septum appears relatively straight in the bony area. The turbinates are moderately enlarged with the right one appearing to cause some significant nasal airway obstruction. Axial view shows that the turbinates are fairly large, particularly the right one. Maxillary sinuses are clear. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has basically a skeletal Class I bite relationship with just a slight Class II occlusal tendency. She does have her head postured quite straight and almost tipped backwards a little bit. Oropharyngeal airway appears to be about 8 mm at the base of tongue and about 4 mm at the soft palate level.

Basic diagnoses for B238 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations without reduction and with some significant degenerative changes.
TMJ pain. Headaches. Impaired jaw function.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery Option 1. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies to maintain the occlusion, but create joint space to accommodate the discs.
Surgery Option 2.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with TMJ total joint prostheses. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B238 MRI 
AGE: DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Coronal view shows that the left TMJ has what appears to be decreased vertical and particularly lateral joint space. Columella appears relatively normal, although flattened a little bit on top and the medial pole appears higher than the lateral pole. There is significantly decreased joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology. There is definite decreased lateral joint space.
Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that demonstrates some anterior beaking. Joint space may be slightly decreased particularly at the posterior aspect of the joint.

Left TMJ tomogram shows some significant flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and some superior beaking and anterior beaking.
Right coronal view shows decreased lateral and superior joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 4 or 5 mm. There appears to be discal tissue anteromedial to the condyle.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have a little bit more degenerated changes on the head of the condyle and some lateral beaking of the condyle. There is decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 or 4 mm. It appears there may be some fluid in the superior joint space. The disc appears to be anterior and medially displaced.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis being slightly worse on the left side and articular disc dislocations without reduction. Discs are probably still salvageable, although there is significant degenerative changes.
