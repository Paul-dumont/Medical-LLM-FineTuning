B457 
B457 is 49 years old. Referred by Dr. XX.

B457 gets headaches about two times per week in the left frontal and temporal area about a level of 5. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 3, and disability at 0. Primary concerns she has at this time include the following:

Clicking in the TMJs.
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Sometimes cannot close her teeth together completely.
Periodic difficulty eating and chewing.
B457 does not know when her TMJ problems began nor is there any known etiology. She did have orthodontics from the age of 14 to 15. She has no earaches, has occasional tinnitus but no vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She has some seasonal allergies and she is allergic to PENICILLIN. She is not aware of any jewelry allergies. She does not believe that she clenches or grinds at nighttime or during the day.

She takes the following medications:
Orthocept (BCP).
Vytorin.
Allegra D occasionally.
Maxalt 10 mg approximately two times per month.
In frontal view, B457 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary and mandibular midlines are just slightly to the left about 1 mm. The chin is slightly off to the left about 2 mm. In profile view, the maxilla is retruded about 4 mm. The mandible is retruded probably about the same amount and the chin is a little bit strong relative to the mandible. The chin neckline may be just slightly short. Intraorally, B457 is missing mandibular first bicuspids and lower teeth are tipped lingually significantly. She is missing the mandibular right second and third molars and probably mandibular left third molar. In the upper arch, she is also missing first cuspids. She is fairly close to being a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has about a 2.5 mm vertical overbite. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. Tonsils were removed at the age of 21. B457 gives no history of nasal airway obstruction. She gives no history of snoring, daytime somnolence, or sleep apnea. She does have some moderate sleep disorder. She is predominantly a nasal breather. When B457 moves her jaws, her mandible deviates to the left side about 3 to 4 mm. On opening, the joints seem to function reasonably smoothly, but on closing she has a click in the right TMJ at about 20 mm. The maximal incisal opening is 30 mm and excursion movement to the right 3 mm and to the left 4 mm. On opening without pain, the measurement is about 26 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars, mandibular right second molar, and all four first bicuspids. The sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size. The condyles appear to be a little bit sclerotic on top.

Coronal view shows that the turbinates are moderately enlarged. The sinuses appear relatively clear.
Axial view shows that the septum is reasonably straight and turbinates are moderate in size and sinuses are relatively clear.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have a little bit of anterior beaking. The condyles are posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is increased anterior joint space, but the articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle and also some flattening in some of the views.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has more significant flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. There is anterior beaking present. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. There is significant decreased lateral joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. There is decreased lower arch joint space. The lateral rim appears to curve inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a good oropharyngeal airway, but the maxilla and mandible appear to be somewhat retruded. Both maxillary and mandibular incisors are in lingual inclination.

Basic diagnoses for B457 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation.
Mandibular hyperplasia.
TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Surgery:
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain occlusion and create space within the joints to accommodate the discs.

DATE OF INTERPRETATION:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm. The disc may be medially displaced but difficult to tell.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. The joint space may be just a little bit wider on this side. The disc may be medially displaced but difficult to tell.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the anterior head with a little bit of anterior beaking present. The disc is slightly anteriorly positioned relative to the crown of the condylar head. The posterior joint space is decreased. The articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is some restricted translation of the condylar head with it coming down just partway along the posterior slope. The disc does not seem to move much at all with the movement. The disc may be adhesed to the fossa. There is a little bit of fluid or inflammation in the superior and inferior joint spaces.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little flattening on the anterior head and some sclerosis on the condylar head. The articular eminence is anteriorly displaced. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is in a pre-click position. There appears to be almost a cystic formation in the posterior band of the disc. The posterior joint space is narrow. Right TMJ opening shows a little bit better translation, although there is still some restriction. The disc reduces relatively early and there is some translation of the disc with the condyle. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc slightly anteriorly displaced with early reduction but with adhesions of the disc to the fossa. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced but with early reduction.
