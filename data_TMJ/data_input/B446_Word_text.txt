B446 is 27 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B446's jaw problems began back in probably her mid-teens, but was not initially identified that she was developing facial asymmetry until she was about 18 years old. When she was 16, she had orthodontics and had apparently a fairly good bite at that time. She did have some teeth extracted, but apparently a good bite. Therefore, the onset of the facial asymmetry began when probably sometime around the age of maybe 15 or 16. She began getting her headaches and noises in her joints when she was 18. She had orthodontics 2 years ago. She had splints from that time and now again she has a splint with Dr. XXXXX that began about 8 months ago. She has had a number of adjustments on her new splint. B446 feels that her jaw problem is getting slowly and progressively more out of alignment. She takes no medications except for discomfort she may take aspirin, acetaminophen, Tylenol, etc.

She rates her TMJ pain at a level of 8, average daily pain at 8, headaches at a level of 8 in her frontal, temporal, and posterior head area. She rates her jaw function at a 4, diet at 5, disability at 3. She gets occasional earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. No other joints bother her except her knees if she runs a lot. She is aware of nocturnal clenching and bruxism.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B446 has fair facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. She has significant asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary midline is probably fairly close to being on the facial midline. The nasal tip may be just slightly off to the right side about 1 or 2 mm. Mandibular dental midline is off to the right side at least 4 mm. Chin is off to the right side about 6 to 7 mm. In profile view, she has fairly good balance with the upper lips on the cheeks and nose. Chin has fairly good AP balance, but the lower lip appears protrusive. Chin neckline may be slightly elongated. Chin might be just slightly forward. Intraorally, she is missing the mandibular left first molar, the mandibular right probably first and second molar and third molar and lingual and mesial inclination. She has space between the lower anterior teeth. The lower anterior teeth appear to be in a little bit of a lingual inclination. The right lateral incisors and bicuspids appear to be slightly elevated compared to the right of the teeth. She appears to have adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she is missing a right first molar. She seems to have all of her teeth on the left side back to the second molars. She has a left-sided almost total buccal crossbite and a right-sided crossbite. Maxillary right central incisor occludes on the mandibular left central incisor. She has open bite on the right side in the bicuspid area. She has a slight Class II cuspid relationship by about 2 mm on the right side and on the left side she is probably closer to a Class I cuspid relationship. To palpation, she has moderate tenderness over the temporalis, masseter, styloid, and right TMJ area. She has moderate to severe tenderness over the SCMs, posterior neck, shoulders, left TMJ, left medial pterygoid area. When she opens, the right joint functions reasonably smooth, but the left side has an opening click at probably about 15 to 20 mm and closing palpable click at 15 mm. When she bites together, she occludes only on her right maxillary central and mandibular left central incisor. Maximal size opening is 53 mm. Excursion movement to the right is 4 mm, to the left 8 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues appear relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum is deviated towards the left side, but turbinates appear relatively normal in size so there appears to be an adequate airway in both sides. She does have a history of snoring at times and it has been increasing lately particularly when she is very tired and it usually occurs in the second half of the night as she has difficulties falling asleep. She is not aware of any daytime somnolence, nor any sleep apnea problems.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows elongated condylar heads and necks being greater on the left side than right side. Missing mandibular left first molar, third molar, mandibular right first and second molar, the third molar drifted forward and mesial inclination. There is space between the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she is missing the right first molar with the second molar drifted forward and missing both third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Waters view shows that sinuses appear clear. Nasal septum appears broad. Turbinates appears moderate in size. Airway appears somewhat constricted. Asymmetry of the mandible is noted.

Right TMJ tomogram is a little bit hard to read. There is some decreased joint space.
Left TMJ tomogram shows elongated head and neck of the condyle. The condyle appears a little bit over enlarged vertically. On opening views, there is fairly good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows prognathic mandible. Oropharyngeal airway looks relatively normal. Bolton's analysis reveals no significant tooth size discrepancy, but the mediolateral width of the maxillary anterior teeth would indicate that there is likely a tooth size problem.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Left mandibular condylar osteochondroma. Left TMJ lateral and anterior dislocated disc. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated anteriorly and non-reducing.
Deviant mandibular prognathism with the mandible shifted about 6 to 7 mm off to the right side. Occluding only on the maxillary right central incisor and mandibular left central incisor.
Severe TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Missing mandibular left first molar, right first and second molars, and missing maxillary right first molar and bilateral third molars.
Class I occlusion on the left side, Class II cuspid relationship on the right side.
Transverse cant on the maxilla with the left side being approximately 2 mm lower than the right side.
Maxillary right cuspid being about 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid.
Spacing between the lower anterior teeth.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of around 2 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics.
a. Align and level maxillary arch. Open space (the size of a bicuspid) in the maxillary right first molar area by shifting the cuspids and bicuspids forward 1 mm and tipping the molar posteriorly.
b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Try to shift the bicuspids and cuspids forward slightly to close the anterior spacing and try to minimize lingual retraction of the incisors.
2.	Surgery.
Left mandibular condylectomy to remove the tumor (osteochondroma).
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to shift the mandible back onto the facial midline. d.	Consider possible maxillary osteotomies to level and correct transverse discrepancies.
3.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Dental implants in the maxillary right first molar area and bilaterally to the mandibular first molar areas. Restorative dentistry to place crowns on the implants.

Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a very unusual shape to it. Medial pole of the condyle is significantly higher than the lateral pole by probably close to about 7 to 8 mm. Lateral pole of the condyle extends lateral to the lateral rim of the fossa. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm. It is difficult to identify discal tissue. Condyle appears larger than normal and takes on the appearance of perhaps an osteochondroma.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is much smaller in size. Medial pole is still higher than the lateral pole, but not to the extent as the left side. It appears there may be some discal tissue anterior and perhaps medial. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. The lateral aspect of the condyle extends out even with, or just slightly beyond, the lateral rim of the fossa. The joint space is decreased vertically. The disc is displaced out laterally and anterior to the condylar head.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle head and neck that is extremely long in length. Towards the lateral aspect of the condyle, the condyle seems to extend out lateral to the lateral rim of the fossa. Joint space vertically and posteriorly appears narrow. Condyle has a little bit better shaped medially than it does laterally. It is difficult to identify discal tissue in the closed view. On opening, however, the disc does come into view and appears to be in relatively normal position on opening. Articular eminence is relatively shallow.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears significantly smaller in size than the opposite side, although it still is fairly long in vertical length. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced and appears significantly deformed. There is discal tissue on lateral, although it appears quite thickened vertically. No particular inflammation is seen around the joint. A little bit of anterior beaking is present towards the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, but the disc appears to be significantly deformed and remains anteriorly displaced, although translation of the condyle is fairly good.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ large deformed condyle and articular disc laterally and anteriorly displaced. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with questionable reduction.
