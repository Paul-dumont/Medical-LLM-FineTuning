B395 
B395 is 30 years old and is referred by Dr. .
Patient History
B395 is in good health. She has had previous surgeries, 7 years ago breast agumentation, and 3 years ago arthrocentesis of the left TMJ. The only medications she currently takes are prenatal vitamins. She had an adverse reaction to a flu shot last year. She is currently pregnant, and she is 21 weeks into her pregnancy. Although B395 was aware of having some clicking in her joints in the past, it wasn't until 4 years ago when she was scuba diving that she began noticing problems in the left TMJ. She would be able to work it out, but then the next time she went scuba diving the same problem would occur again. She had had her wisdom teeth removed on at the age of 25 by Dr.  . After developing her TMJ problems, Dr.  treated her with an arthrocentesis. On , she had an arthrocentesis procedure performed. She did have a splint made by Dr. last year, but this didn't seem to help her. She then went to see Dr.  , who made a splint that seemed to have helped her quite a bit.

Clinical Examination
B395 has good facial symmetry and balance.
Intraorally, she is missing the lower second bicuspids but has the rest of her teeth. Some mild crowding, lower anterior arch. Transverse width of the lower arch appears to be somewhat narrow. She has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. In the upper arch, it appears she is missing the first bicuspids. She has a crown on the left first molar. Oropharynx appears clear. She has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. Teeth may be just slightly parted in the molar area. Appears she hits primarily on her front teeth on the cuspids on forward. With the splint in, it does open her bite up some. Incisors are not touching the splint which is in contact from her cuspids on posteriorly.

To palpation, B395 has no tenderness around the head and neck area nor over the TMJ. To palpation, the lateral pole of the condyle in the left joint extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

On opening, the right joint functions relatively smoothly. Left joint, however, has significant crepitation. Maximal incisal opening is 46 mm, but B395 could open to about 37 mm without too much discomfort. Excursive movement to the right was 8 mm and to the left 12 mm. She wore braces from 7 to 9 years ago. It was at that time that the bicuspids were extracted.

Other Systems
B395 has no TMJ problems, no history of urinary tract infections, no fertility problems, and no miscarriages. She has one child, a 13-year-old girl, and she is currently pregnant. She had an abnormal Pap smear x 1 and had cryosurgery for treatment, and this was about a year ago. She gets occasional vaginal yeast infections but no more than once a year and maybe only twice in the past five years. No problems with periodontal, ocular, sinus, or ear problems. Has never smoked. Had bronchitis x 2 at age 19 and at age 27. She does have some problems with constipation. She was diagnosed with Chlamydia two times as a teenager. She was around about 20 chickens from the age of 7 and 8. She had a cat for about 5 years as a child, and that cat did eat birds on occasion. She has had dogs almost her whole life, and some of those would catch birds as well. She was around pigs from about the age of 7 to 12, and they had about 4 a year and raised them for 4H projects. She also was around horses for a couple of years around the same time. She does have breast implants that were placed 7 years ago but no other implants. B395's orthodontist is Dr.  .
