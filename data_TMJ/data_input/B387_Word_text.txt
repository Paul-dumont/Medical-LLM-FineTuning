B387 
B387 is 45 years old and referred by Dr.  .
Patient History
B387 has had previous surgery for a hysterectomy and a tonsillectomy. B387 has had back surgery as well 9 years agof, L5-S1 fusion. She has done fairly well with that surgery until recently. B387 had her hysterectomy 9 years ago. The tonsillectomy was done back around 30 years ago when she was a child.

She has had allergic reactions to CODEINE AND SULFA.
An additional surgery that B387 recalls is that she had nasal septoplasty performed in the ‘80s for chronic sinus problems.

About three years ago, B387 fell and struck the left side of her neck, ear, and jaw area. Since that time, she has had problems and symptoms on the left side of the face and jaw area. She has no problems on the right side. B387 gets left-sided earaches, occasional tinnitus, and occasional vertigo. No hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include the bones in her neck, back, hips, and left knee. She is very much aware of clenching and bruxing at night and also she does this during the day as well. She rates her headaches at about a level of 8 in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area, and she does have fairly constant headaches. She rates her TMJ pain at 9, overall pain at 6, jaw function at 5, but this can escalate to 8, diet at 5, and disability at 4. Previous treatments B387 has had include the following:

For two years she has worn splints and has had four different splints
Chiropractic treatment about once a month and has done this for the past year
Massage therapy
Physical therapy where her jaws have been stretched to try to improve the function ability

B387 feels as though there are some changes going on in her teeth where her upper right lateral incisor has come forward and the lower incisors have tipped lingually some.

She wakes up with quite a bit of pain in the mornings indicative of the nocturnal clenching and bruxism.
Current Medications
Premarin 0.625 mg, 1 q.d.
Prozac 20 mg, 1 tablet q.d.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B387 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary, mandibular, and chin midlines are all pretty much on the facial midline.

In profile, B387 appears to have fairly good facial balance. Chin-neckline may be just slightly short, and chin-neck angle is moderately well-defined. B387 does weigh currently 88 lb.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some moderate crowding, lower anterior arch. Has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present with some mild crowding. Slight reverse curve of occlusion present in the upper arch. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. Oropharynx appears clear.

To palpation, she has some moderate to high moderate pain in the left temporalis, left masseter, left medial pterygoid and styloid area and milder tenderness over the right side in the same areas, although there is tenderness in the same. To palpation, she registers her TMJ pain at a level of 3. Incisal opening is 43 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 6 mm and to the left 10 mm. Maximal incisal opening is 43 mm and about 25 with reasonable comfort. B387 can remember a couple years ago when she had significant popping on the left jaw joint before it became more silent.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a root canal in the mandibular right central incisor. Sinuses look clear and healthy. Condyles actually look fairly good. No significant pathology noted. Root of the maxillary right lateral incisor appears a little bit short.

Waters view shows that the sinuses all appear clear. Appear the turbinates on the left side are a little bit enlarged, but the airway on the right side is very good.

Left TMJ tomograms show a decreased superior and posterior joint space. Some anterior beaking is present and a little bit of sclerosis on the anterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that might be slightly posteriorly positioned in the fossa but appears to have good vertical and anterior joint spaces. Condyle appears a little bit flat on top. Articular eminence is moderately steep as it is on the other side as well.

On opening, there is restricted translation on the left joint but relatively normal translation on the right joint.
Cephalometrically, she appears to be a Class I cuspid-molar relationship and occlusal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks relatively normal in size. B387 demonstrates a tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of about 2.5 mm.

Basic Diagnoses
Left TMJ advanced arthritis and articular disc dislocated medially
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation medially
Relative mandibular hyperplasia
Severe headaches Severe TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Significant crowding, lower anterior arch
Mild crowding, upper anterior arch
Tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of 2.5 mm
Left-sided earaches Nocturnal and daytime clenching and bruxism
Recommended Treatment

Medications (i.e. Klonopin) to control nocturnal clenching and bruxism
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing approximately 2.5 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth-size discrepancy without altering the occlusion

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain the original occlusion but allow the proximal segments to move downward and forward to make room for the discs within the joint

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B387  MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of :
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with very good mediolateral width. The condyle actually lights up quite significantly. Decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral extent where there is very minimal joint space. Appears that there is discal tissue displaced medially. Difficult to see if there is discal tissue anteriorly, although there very well could be. Cortical bone in both condyle and fossa appears to be intact. Condylar head appears to be nicely rounded. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa with it extending down probably around 3 mm.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Condyle does not light up quite as much as the opposite side. Appears to be decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral rim area. In fact, there is major decreased joint space at the lateral rim of the fossa. Lateral rim curves inferiorly a moderate amount. Appears to be discal tissue medially and probably anterior to the condyle. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some sclerosis on the anterior and superior head. Decreased posterior joint space particularly out laterally, although more medially it is in better place. Appears that there may be discal tissue in appropriate position. It is possible there could be a posteriorly medially displaced disc. Joint space toward the medial side appears actually increased. Articular eminence is moderately shallow in slope. Cortical bones appear to be intact. No particular inflammatory response within the joint space.

On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle. Difficult to identify articular discal tissues. Translation does not come to the inferior aspect of the articular eminence. May be a slightly decreased joint space between the condyle and articular eminence in the open views.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with fairly good shape and morphology. Out laterally, the disc is difficult to see. More medially, the disc appears to have good shape and appears to be in position. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Toward the lateral aspect of the joint, however, the disc could be anteriorly displaced but difficult to tell. May be slightly decreased posterior joint space. Probably no particular inflammatory process seen.

On opening, there appears to be moderately good translation and slightly better than the opposite side. Appears that the discal tissues are in place on some of the views; however, in one view there seems to be significantly decreased joint space between the condyle and the articular eminence.

Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis with medial and probably anterior articular disc dislocation
Right TMJ probable medial disc displacement
