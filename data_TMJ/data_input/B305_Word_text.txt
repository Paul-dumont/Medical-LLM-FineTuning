B305 
B305 is 21 years old and referred by Dr. __. She has had previous gum grafts, a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Her bite is off.
Teeth are misaligned.
Cannot chew with mouth closed. Facial profile is unbalanced.
B305 gets occasional earaches particularly when she runs in cold weather or swims. No tenderness. She does get occasional vertigo but no hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her shoulders. She does apparently clench and grind her teeth at night and during the day she also clenches some. She does have low blood sugar. She is a long distance runner.

MEDICATIONS: Ortho-TriCyclen.
The onset of B305's problems as far as she is aware began when she was about 16 following removal of orthodontic appliances for the second time. Etiology is unknown. She had her orthodontics from the age of 13 to 15 and then again for about approximately nine months when she was about 16 to 17 years of age. Dr. __ performed the orthodontics for her. She gets headaches only about once a month at a level of about 3 in the temple area. She really does not have any significant TMJ pain or any pain around the head and neck area. She rates her jaw function at 3, diet at 4, disability at 0.

In the frontal view, B305 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is 21 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is 6 mm on the right and 5 mm on the left. Maxillary midline is probably about 1.5 mm off to the left side. Mandibular dental midline and chin are closer to being on the facial midline. In profile view, that maxilla is retruded about 4 to 5 mm. Chin is retruded closer to 15 to 18 mm. She has probably about 7 to 8 mm of lip incompetence. The lower third face is elongated. Chin-neckline is fairly short although chin-neck angle is fairly well defined. The chin appears to be deviated to the left about 1 to 2 mm. There is a transverse cant in occlusal plane with the left side being about 1 mm to 1.5 mm higher than the right side. The oropharynx appears clear and the uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars appear normal. Intraorally, B305  is missing mandibular first bicuspids. She has the rest of her teeth. She has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch she is also missing first bicuspids and has the rest of her teeth back through her second molars. She is almost a full Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and on the left side he has is end-on Class II by probably 2 to 3 mm. She has about a 1 to 2 mm vertical overbite relationship with about at least a 4 mm overjet relationship. The right cuspid is about 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid in the maxillary arch. The lower arch is a little bit more symmetric. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum may be a little bit off to the right side. Columella is quite wide creating narrow nostrils which affect her ability to breathe. In opening up the nostrils with a nasal scope it significantly improved her ability to breathe through her nose. The luminal valves themselves appear reasonably okay.

B305 
She is not aware of any problems with snoring, daytime somnolence or sleep apnea symptoms. She tends to sleep on her stomach and side. To palpation she has some moderate discomfort in the styloid areas. The other areas are relatively pain free including other the TMJs. On opening, she has a definite pop on the left side about 30 mm and close around 15 to 20. The right joint seems to function a little bit more smoothly because the disc is nonreducing. Maximal incisal opening is about 54 mm and excursive movements about 9 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and all four first bicuspids. There is some foreshortening of the incisor roots in all four quadrants. The condyles appear a little bit arthritic and the condylar head and necks appear a little bit short in vertical height. The sinuses look reasonably clear.

Waters show the sinuses appear clear. The septum is a little bit deviated in the bony area off to the right side. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged with a little airway space available.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be decreased superior joint space but not too significant.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears smaller in size than the opposite. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The joint space actually looks reasonably good. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has anterior vertical maxillary excess and significant AP mandibular retrusion and AP deficiency as well. Oropharyngeal airway actually looks quite good considering the amount of mandibular retrusion. She has a high occlusal plane angle. She has a skeletal and occlusal Class II relationship. She has some vertical imbalance from the left to right side as well. BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and articular disc dislocation with reduction on the left side and nonreducing on the right side.
AP mandibular deficiency.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Transverse maxillary deficiency.
Vertical maxillary excess. Class II end-on occlusion being worse on the right side as compared to the left side. Maxillary midline shifted off to the left.
Lip incompetence. Missing all four first bicuspids and all four third molars.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Wide columella creating narrow nostrils.
Nasal airway obstruction. Lip incompetence.
B305 

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Bilaminar ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly and expand it.
Bilateral partial turbinectomies.
Reconstruction of the columella.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears small in size and appears to have undergone some resorptive changes. The joint space actually looks fairly good. There appears to be a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There may be some discal tissue anteromedial to the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferior about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears small in size and appears to have undergone some resorptive changes. The joint space actually looks fairly good. There appears to be a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There may be some discal tissue anteromedial to the condyle. There appears to be decreased lateral joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferior about 2 to 3 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology on this view. A little bit of flattening on the anterior head. A little bit of sclerosis. There may be a little osteophyte coming off the anterosuperior head. A little bit of anterior beaking present but not too significant. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence and along the posterior slope of the fossa. The disc is quite small in anteroposterior dimension. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space and maybe a little bit in the inferior joint space but not too significant. On opening, the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. There is fairly good translation in both the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have a little bit of morphology than in the coronal view. There is some anterior beaking present and some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is not quite as steep as the opposite side but it is fairly long in length. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence and along the posterior slope of the eminence. There appears to be some decreased joint space particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint. There is a great amount of fluid in the superior joint space compared to the opposite side. There is a little bit of fluid in the inferior joint space as well. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the articular disc where the disc remains nonreducing and significantly deformed.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and significant deformation of the disc. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and significant deformation of the disc.
Salvageability of the articular disc that is probably worth trying.
