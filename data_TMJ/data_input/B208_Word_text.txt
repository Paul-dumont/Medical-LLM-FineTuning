B208
B208 is 43 years old. Referred by Dr. XXXX.
B208's TMJ problems began when she was about 20 years old. She had orthodontics as a child. She then was placed in splints because of a locking problems with the right temporomandibular joint. She went back into orthodontics at age 23 for about 1 year and finished 20 years ago with a good bite result. She continued to have problems and started splint therapy 23 years ago. She was in and out of splints for a while, but for the past 16 years to the present she has been in splints 24/7.

She currently takes the following medications:
Zovia (BCP).
Darvocet p.r.n. pain. Meprobamate 400 mg t.i.d.
B208 gets headaches in the right frontal and temple area at a level of 7. She rates her TMJ pain that occurs only on the right side at a level of 7, average daily pain on the right side at 5, jaw function at 6, diet at 3, disability at 6. She gets occasional earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her left knee, right ankle, right shoulder, and wrists. She is aware of clenching at night time and also during the day. She states that she has no problems with snoring, but does have some mild daytime somnolence. She has no sleep apnea, but has a moderate sleep disorder mainly related to the pain factors. She is predominantly a nasal breather.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B208 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 1 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all fairly well aligned with each other. Chin may be shifted just slightly towards the right side 1-2 mm. In profile, she has some AP deficiency of the upper lip of about 2-3 mm. The lower lip is just slightly retruded also, although the chin is moderately prominent. The chin neck has fairly good length, although the chin neck angle is moderately well defined. Intraorally, she is missing lower second bicuspids, but has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some blunting of the papilla on the lower anterior teeth. She has some mild crowding. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper jaw, she has had first bicuspids extracted, but has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an end-on incisor relationship and bilateral posterior open bites of about almost 4-5 mm on the left side and about 3 mm on the right side. She is actually fairly close to being a Class I cuspid relationship, but slight Class III molar relationship. The maxilla is fairly level transversely, but the mandible on the left side in the cuspid area is inferiorly positioned about 1-2 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues looks reasonably healthy. There is some mild increased size of the uvula, but soft palate length looks normal. The tonsils are present. Intranasally, the septum may be just slightly off to the left side. Turbinates appears relatively normal in size. B208 does not report any nasal airway breathing difficulties. To palpation, B208 has moderate pain over the right masseter, right TMJ, right retromandibular area, and milder pain in the right shoulder. No pain on the left side. On opening, the left joint functions reasonably smoothly, although occasionally there was a little bit of a pop. She has glitches and some crepitus kind of noises in the right TMJ. Maximum incisal opening is about 43 mm and she can get open to about 32 without significant pain. Excursion movements to the right and left are about 6 mm in each direction, but painful on the right side with both movements.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars as well as the maxillary first bicuspids and mandibular second bicuspids. She has a root canal in the mandibular first molar and she has crowns on both mandibular first molars and maxillary left first molar. Right TMJ appears arthritic. Right turbinate appears moderately enlarged. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Coronal view shows that the turbinates appears quite large more posterior, but the sinuses are all clear. Axial view also shows that the turbinates appear quite enlarged. Left TMJ sagittal view shows condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and just some slight peaking of the condyle. Joint space appears reasonable. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has advanced arthritis in it. There is sclerosis in the head of the condyle, and there are erosions in the posterior head and pseudocysts within the condyle. There decreased anterior and superior joint space. Left TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle with fairly good morphology. It appears there may be some decreased joint space medially. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly only about 1-2 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows that there are sclerotic areas on the condylar head and significant degenerated changes. There is a major erosion in the lateral posterior aspect of the condylar head. The condyle appears quite arthritic. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B208 has some AP maxillary deficiency and AP mandibular deficiency. She has huge bilateral posterior open bites. The oropharyngeal airway is constricted at the soft palate level with an AP dimension of only about 5 mm and at the base of the tongue measures only about 8 mm. She has an end-on incisor relationship.

For the first five years of B208's life, she did live on a farm where they did have chickens. There were probably just a handful of chickens around. Other than that she does not really feel that has had any significant contact with birds. B208 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 2 mm. In placing the models in the best occlusal fit, she is still Class II end-on in the cuspid area and actually has some mild crowding in upper and lower anterior arches.

Basic diagnoses for B208 would be as follows:
Right TMJ severe arthritis. Left TMJ articular disc slightly anteriorly and laterally displaced, but asymptomatic. AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia and posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.
Severe bilateral posterior open bites being 3 mm on the right side, but 5 mm on the left side. Transverse cant in the mandibular occlusal plane with the left side being 2 mm lower than the right side. End-on incisor relationship.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Missing maxillary first bicuspids, mandibular second bicuspids as a result of previous orthodontics. Hypertrophied turbinates with nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of approximately 2 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Open up 1 mm of space between the upper laterals and cuspids. Tip lateral incisors roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Right TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prosthesis. Right TMJ fat graft (harvest from the abdomen).
Right mandibular coronoidotomy. Left mandibular sagittal split osteotomy to advance the mandible. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction and down graft it posteriorly. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B208 MRI AGE: 43/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good shape and contour. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just a very minimal amount. The articular disc appears to be anteriorly and laterally displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has significant arthritic changes with a central areas that appears to be necrotic with erosions present. The disc tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good shape with some flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. Out laterally, the disc is displaced laterally and also anterior. More medial, the disc is in better position, but at the far medial side, the discal tissue does not appear to be present compatible with a lateral discal displacement. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the articular disc reduces into position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have condylar lysis present. She appears to have lytic areas in the condylar head and may have avascular necrosis present. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and demonstrates some significant degenerative changes.

On T2 films, there are 2 areas within the condylar heard that light up. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, but the remnants of the articular disc remain anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and laterally displaced with reduction. Right TMJ probable avascular necrosis with the condylar head with articular disc anteriorly displaced, nonreducing, and significantly deformed and degenerated.
