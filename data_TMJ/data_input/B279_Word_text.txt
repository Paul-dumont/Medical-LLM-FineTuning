B279  MRI EVALUATION 
(This is an MRI redo)
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has very little flattening on the anterior head and decreased superior and posterior joint spaces are present. Disc appears to be slightly anteriorly positioned. More medially the disc is in a better position but laterally it appears to be anteriorly displaced. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and early reduction of the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows an anteriorly displaced disc. There appears to be decreased anterior and posterior joint space. A little bit of flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. On opening, there appears to be relatively early reduction.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with early reduction.
B279 
B279 is 48 years old and is referred by Dr. __.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Jaw popping especially when eating or chewing.
Cannot open her jaws in the morning after using her nightguard unless she forces her jaws open.
Increased sensitivity in her teeth on the right side.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Allegra.
Zestoretic. Lipitor.
Nasonex. Aranelle. She will not require this medication next month as she is having a hysterectomy.

She does have problems with high blood pressure and with elevated cholesterol.
PREVIOUS SURGERIES:
Tonsillectomy about 44 years ago.
Appendectomy 35 years ago.
Left carpal tunnel release last year.
Wisdom teeth around 24 years ago. She actually had five wisdom teeth.

B279 is unsure when her TMJ problems began but her jaw has been popping for as long as she can remember. She cannot remember when it has not popped particularly with eating. Etiology is unknown. She has worn a mouthguard since a few months ago and has had a number of adjustments done on it. However, this tends to make her situation worse. She finds that when she wears a mouthguard it is very difficult for her to open her mouth in the mornings and she has to pop her jaw to get it open. She has hypersensitivity of her teeth on the right side in both upper and lower arch. When she wears a mouthguard it seems to help that probably because it distributes the loading forces of a larger area and without it she probably still has some clenching and bruxism that may make those teeth more sensitive. B279 gets headaches about one time a week at about a level of 3 in the frontal and temple areas. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 5, diet at 1 and disability at 1. She gets moderate earaches, frequent tinnitus and occasional vertigo but this is predominately related towards change in vertical position of her body. Other joints that bother her include her knees, toes and her left wrist. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at nighttime and also some during the day. She plays the French horn, as does her husband Ron. B279 has moderate snoring and some mild daytime somnolence. Apparently no history of sleep apnea problems.

In frontal view, B279 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm. Maxillary midline may be just about 1 mm off to the right side. Mandibular midline is about is about 1 mm off to the left. Chin is pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, she has good facial balance. Intraorally, B279 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has a crown on the left first and second molar and right second bicuspid and first molar. She has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch but has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has crowns on the first molars. She has a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side and Class II end-on on the left side probably 2 to 3 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of about 5 mm. The uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal. Faucial pillars appear moderately constricted. Tonsils are mildly enlarged. The nasal septum deviates off to the left side and then off to the right side. The turbinate on the left side is relatively normal. On the right side it is mild to moderately enlarged. I do not believe she has a significant nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the styloid areas, right TMJ and minimal tenderness over the right masseter and the posterior neck area. On opening, she had a definite pop in the left joint at about 10 mm but on closing her pop was on the right side at about 5 mm. Maximal incisal opening is about 60 mm. Excursive movements are about 11 in each direction. In excursive movement the left side is fairly smooth though the right side has almost a definite almost audible pop on excursive movements. Transverse occlusal plane is fairly level.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has root canals on the right maxillary and mandibular second bicuspid and mandibular right first molar. She has a root canal in the left maxillary and mandibular first molars. It is difficult to evaluate the joints. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows decreased vertical and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderate in inclination. The left TMJ tomogram was printed backwards.

Right TMJ tomogram shows decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Water view shows that the bony septum is fairly straight. The turbinates are moderate in size with the left one being larger than the right one. Frontal sinuses are extremely large but appear.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class I jaw relationship and a relatively normal oropharyngeal airway.
BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction and mild arthritis.
Class I occlusion on the right side, Class II end-on on the left side.
TMJ pain.
Headaches
Anterior dep bite.
Mild crowding of upper and lower anterior arches. Clenching and bruxism.

Splint therapy tends to make her clench more and makes her teeth very hypersensitive and it also makes it difficult for her to unlock her jaws in the morning. She obviously is clenching and bruxing at night when she is sleeping.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications.
Klonopin 1 mg tablet q.h.s. to try and control nocturnal clenching and bruxism.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain the occlusion.
Application of arch bars.
Remove arch bars 2 to 4 weeks postsurgery.

B279  MRI EVALUATION
AGE: 48
DOB: 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. Decreased superior joint space. There may be some discal tissue on the medial aspect of the condyle but the lateral is uncovered. There may be discal tissue anterior.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of perhaps 2 mm. Difficult to identify discal tissue within the joint space although the joint space appears slightly wider than the opposite side. I am missing most of the images of all the series.

Left TMJ sagittal view has only 2 images. The condyle appears to have fairly good shape. The disc is anteriorly dislocated. The disc is a little bit short anteroposteriorly. There appears to be decreased posterior joint space. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there appears to be relatively early reduction of the disc and the condyle and disc translate forward quite well on opening.

Right TMJ sagittal view again is lacking almost all of the images. The condyle appears to have reasonably good morphology. The disc is anteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the joint space area. On opening, there is relatively early reduction of the articular disc.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction.
Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction.
