B517
B517 is 32 years old and is referred by Dr. XXXX. B517 has had previous orthodontics but primarily related to nightguard treatment to try and get her more comfortable. She did have previous orthodontics back around 15 years ago. B517 was involved in a motor vehicle accident 15 years ago where she had facial injuries and had her lower jaw apparently pushed backwards. It is not known if she had actual mandibular fractures but she may have had some dental alveolar fractures. She did have her teeth wired together for a while so it is possible she may have some type of fracture. She had a left zygomatic orbital complex that apparently was reduced. B517 has been to about 7 different doctors trying to get her problems diagnosed and properly treated. She has had at least three splints. She had her teeth equilibrated and she has had some bite alignment procedures performed. In addition, she has had physical therapy and she has had chiropractic treatments with no improvement. She has been on antidepressants, pain medications and muscle relaxants without any improvement. She has been told she just needs to relax and that will help her symptoms go away.

In frontal view, she has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. The left zygomatic orbital complex is posteriorly positioned compared to the right side probably 4 to 5 mm at least. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary midline is off to the left side probably a couple of mm. Mandibular dental midline is also off to the left about 2 mm as is the chin. The chin is actually pretty much on the midline. It is just the maxillary and mandibular teeth that are off to the left about 2 mm. In profile view, she has some AP maxillary deficiency probably about 3 to 4 mm. The mandible is retruded by probably about a good 8 mm. Chin-neckline is short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. She has slight head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. She actually is missing the right lateral incisor and it has a pontic crown that appears to be based off the right cuspid. The teeth show mild crowding. She has some accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has small upper lateral incisors. She has reverse curve of Spee in the upper arch. She has an anterior deep bite of about 6 mm. She has an end-on Class II cuspid relationship probably about 3 to 4 mm Class II. The uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal although the soft palate may be a little bit elongated. The faucial pillars show some significant transverse constricture. The tonsils may be just mildly enlarged but not too significant. The nasal septum is deviated a little bit off towards the right side. The left turbinate is quite large. The right turbinate is relatively large compared to the airway. However, she does not complain of difficulties breathing through her nose. At the anterior aspect of her nose the septum is deviated off into the left nostril area causing constricture of the left nostril though not a significant problem for her. She has some mild snoring and mild daytime somnolence but she is not are of any sleep apnea problems. She does have difficulty sleeping at night. On opening, she has some clicking in both joints at about 10 to 15 mm and a closing click in both joints about 5 to 10 mm. Maximal incisal opening is 36 mm but opening without pain is 23 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 8 mm, to the left 4 mm. To palpation, she has mild to moderate pain over the right side in the temporalis, masseter, TMJ, styloid and SCM as well as the posterior neck area. 

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of maxillary third molars but she has horizontally impacted mandibular third molars. Missing mandibular right lateral incisor that is cantilevered off the crown of the right cuspid. She also has a crown on the left cuspid and on the maxillary right central incisor. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Right TMJ appears quite arthritic. Left TMJ appears to have a more normal morphology.
Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. The bony septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. The right turbinate appears much larger than the left side. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has sort of a hockey stick shape to it. A little bit of sclerosis on the head. There may be decreased joint space vertically but difficult to tell. Articular eminence is fairly steep.

Right TMJ tomogram appears arthritic with possible loss of condylar volume. Articular eminence is more shallow on this side compared to the opposite side. Of the cuts performed there appears to be some joint space but these may be more lateral cuts. On opening, there is reasonable translation of both joints. Significant arthritis on the right side is noted.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B517 has a significant skeletal Class II division II malocclusion. Oropharyngeal airway is decreased being only about 6 to 7 mm at the soft palate level. The base of the tongue may be about 6 mm and down closer to the hyoid may be only about 2 to 3 mm. B517 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 3 mm. She has a slightly reverse curve of occlusion in the upper arch and accentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch by about 3 mm. She has a transverse arch asymmetry in upper arches with the left cuspid being about 1 to 2 mm posterior to the right cuspids.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Right TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with significant deformation. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
AP mandibular deficiency. Class II division II malocclusion. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications to try to decrease nocturnal clenching and decrease pain. Klonopin 1 mg tablet q.h.s., dispense 30 tablets, refill x3.
CT scans of TMJs and jaws.

Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Application and removal of arch bars.

B517 MRI EVALUATION
On sagittal view, images are in the open position with the condyle beneath the articular eminence. The articular disc appears to be in position. The condyle may be a little flattened anteriorly and there may be a little bit of anterior beaking present. These go across to the right side where it shows significant degenerative changes. There appears to be some erosion and some osteophytes on the condylar head. Translation is good though the condyle and disc appears to remain intact and in position. It appears there may be some inflammation in the joints.

Right TMJ shows severe degenerative disease with erosions in the condylar head. The condyle appears very sclerotic. There appears to be bony changes within the fossa as well. Difficult to identify discal tissue. It maybe anteriorly displaced. There appears to be a small osteophyte off the posterior superior head of the condyle. There is a little bit of anterior beaking presents. The fossa appears somewhat irregular. Errosions are present on the articular eminence and condyle. There appears to be some inflammatory tissue in the joint and a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. In one view it appears there that there may be some discal tissue posterior to the condyle.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc in position on opening. Right TMJ severe degenerative disease with sclerosis, loss of condylar volume and degenerative changes with osteophytes. Erosions are present on the articular eminence. Articular disc is difficult to identify.

B517 MRI EVALUATION
Left TMJ shows a condyle that has a hockey stick shape to it. There is some anterior beaking present. The only views are in the open position. There is fluid in the superior joint space. Articular disc appears to be in a reduced position on the open view. Articular eminence is fairly steep. A little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. Significant anterior beaking with a sclerotic beak.

Right sagittal MRI shows a condyle that is quite arthritic and degenerated. Significant sclerosis involved with it. There appears to be loss of vertical volume in the condyle. There appears to be erosion in the posterior aspect of the articular eminence. There appears to be a mass of reactive tissue in the joint space. There is a dark area in there that may be an area of scar tissue versus some calcification. There may be a little bit of discal tissue anterior to the condyle. There are erosions in the head of the condyle. The erosion of the articular eminence appears to penetrate through the cortical bone. There appears to be some reactive bone buildup on the articular eminence perhaps.

IMPRESSION: MRI taken only in the open view with no closed imaging.
Left TMJ arthritis but with the articular disc in position in the open view.
Right TMJ severe arthritis with condylar resorption and erosion of both the condyle and the fossa and articular eminence. Indication for bilateral TMJ total joint prostheses.
