B285 
B285 is 18 years old and referred by Dr. ___.
Patient History

B285 had orthodontics performed by Dr. __ when she was about 11 or 12 years of age and had them on for about two years. B285 for some reason on the left side she had a 6-year-old molar removed at about the age of 8. The plan apparently was to allow the second and third molars to erupt in and move forward some. The third molar apparently came in a little bit crooked, and B285 went to see about that and found out that her bite was off. She has been aware that she chews primarily on her right side and not at all on the left side.

B285 gives no history of earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. She has some occasional problems with her hips, and they pop but occasionally can cause some discomfort. She is allergic to PENICILLIN, CEPHALOSPORINS, AND Z-PAK. She can take Cleocin. She has problems with cheap jewelry even belts with metal buckles. She probably has a significant nickel allergy. She thinks she may clench and brux her teeth at night because Dr. __ has informed her of that. She gets headaches almost daily, and the typical headache runs about a level of 5, but several times a month they can get to a level of 9. On an average day, her facial pain and headaches she rates at about a level of 6, TMJ pain at 2, jaw function at 2, diet at 3, and disability at 3. When she gets her severe headaches, however, her disability escalates to an 8.

By history, her TMJ problems began 3 years ago of unknown etiology. Prior to that, she had orthodontics at the age of 11 or 12 for about two years and apparently had a good bite relationship at that time. The orthodontics was done by Dr. __. 4 years ago the first that she became aware that her bite was opening on the left side. She began orthodontics again 3 years ago with Dr. __. She is taking marine biology.

Medications she takes include Excedrin and Motrin. The Excedrin does help her significantly with her bad headaches.
Dr. __ has made a bite plate for her to wear at night. If she wears the splint at night, she does reasonably well. Prior to getting the splint, and if the splint comes out at night, then she usually wakes up with headaches in the morning. This is indicative of probably nocturnal clenching and bruxism.

Patient Concerns
Teeth don't touch on the left side
Some difficulties chewing
Headaches TMJ pain
Popping in the TMJs
Snoring
Possible difficulties breathing through the nose

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B285 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3.5 to 4 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted to the left about 2 mm. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are fairly well aligned with each other. Therefore, the chin and mandibular dental midline are shifted off to the left side.

In profile view, she has fairly good facial balance although could be maybe just AP maxillary deficient by maybe 3 to 4 mm at the most and likewise with the chin. Chin-neckline appears relatively normal length, although she has just some slight increased fullness in the submental area.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth except for the mandibular left first molar which is missing, but the second and third molar are brought forward into position. The left cuspid may be 1 to 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Upper lateral incisors might be a little bit small. She has a slight Class III cuspid relationship on the right side by probably 1 to 2 mm, and on the left side she is closer to Class I but has a crossbite on that side. The crossbite includes the lateral incisor through the second molar, although the first molar area is a little bit closer to a normal crossbite relationship. In the upper arch, the left cuspid might be just about a millimeter posterior to the right cuspid. Has a definite cant in the maxillary occlusion with the left cuspid being at least 2 mm higher than the right cuspid. Mandibular arch is fairly level. Gently putting posterior pressure on the mandible it did create discomfort in the jaw area bilaterally back around the TMJs and masseter muscle areas. The open bite on the left side is predominantly in the lateral incisor to the second bicuspid area and probably is 2 mm open in the lateral incisors compared to the opposite side and about 1 mm in the second bicuspid area. Oropharynx appears clear. She does have moderate-sized tonsils, but they appear fairly healthy.

Intranasally, the left turbinate appears enlarged right now, but B285 has a cold today that she has had just the last few days and normally is not this congested. However, her nostrils are a little bit narrow, and when I use the scope to hold open the nostrils, she could breathe better.

Tooth-size analysis reveals a Bolton's difference of about 2.5 mm.
On opening, B285 has a definite pop in both TMJs. On the right side, it occurs at about 5 mm of opening and closing, and on the left side the opening pop is at about 10 mm of opening and about 5 mm of closing. This fairly well correlates to the MRI findings. Maximal incisal opening is 54 mm. Opening without developing significant discomfort was 19 mm. Excursive movement to the right was 6 mm and to the left 7 mm. To percussion could not detect any evidence of ankylosis.

Radiographic Evaluation
Radiographically cannot detect any evidence of ankylosis in that maxillary left quadrant. Radiographically, the cuspid root has moved significantly mesially over the last three years probably due to some orthodontic changes.

Panorex shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size. Missing maxillary third molars, mandibular right third molar, and mandibular left first molar with the second and third molars in the first and second molar positions. She has a root canal in the maxillary right first molar. Condyles look reasonably good.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with anterior beaking and somewhat forward rotation of the condylar head. Articular eminence is fairly steep and long. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Appears to be an increase anterior joint space. Disc is probably in somewhat of a vertical orientation.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit narrow anteroposteriorly. It is sitting posteriorly in the fossa with a significantly increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence on this side is long but not quite as long as the opposite side. Condyle may appear just a little bit arthritic.

On opening, there is good translation in the both joints, but the right one has a much greater translation forward beyond the articular eminence as compared to the left side.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are reasonably clear although a little bit of fluid perhaps in both maxillary sinuses currently. The left turbinate appears quite large and appears to be obliterating most of the airway, although on the right side the airway looks reasonably good. Asymmetry in the mandible can be appreciated with the mandible being shifted off toward the left side about 2 mm.

Cephalometrically, she appears to be a skeletal Class I and appears to have a Class I occlusion at least cephalometrically. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level is about 9 mm and at the base of the tongue is about 7 to 8 mm. A little bit of difference between the vertical heights of the inferior border of the mandible and also perhaps a little bit at the occlusal plane.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction
Mandibular prognathism and asymmetry
Rule out right condylar hyperplasia versus osteochondroma
Left posterior vertical maxillary deficiency
Left lateral open bite extending from the left lateral incisors through the second bicuspids
Class III end-on occlusion on the right side (2 to 3 mm) and Class I on the left side
Left crossbite extending from the lateral incisor through the second bicuspid
Headaches TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm
Cant in the maxillary occlusal plane with the left cuspid 2 mm higher than the right cuspid

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially but tip cuspid roots distally. Try to extrude maxillary left lateral incisor, cuspid, and first bicuspid to transversely level the maxillary plane

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies with bone screw stabilization to shift the mandible to the right onto the facial midline and correct the Class III occlusion on the right side and the crossbite on the left side
Multiple maxillary osteotomies if necessary to level the transverse occlusal plane and correct any transverse problems that may develop

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
We located some previous dental models that were taken 4 years ago. It shows that the dental midline has not really changed appreciably. I do not believe that she has any active bone growth at this time.

B285  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition:	
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral pole of the condyle extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa and has an upward turn on it. The lateral pole of the condyle is significantly lower than the medial pole by probably 4 or 5 mm. Joint space appears decreased vertically. There could be some discal tissue displaced medially. It also appears that there is anteriorly positioned discal tissue. Cortical bone on the condyle appears for the most part to be intact, although the head does appear to have some irregularity in some of the views.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is quite broad. Lateral pole of it seems to extend slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Lateral pole is significantly lower than the medial pole by probably 4 mm. Decreased vertical joint space. Appears there may be some discal tissue medially possibly but anteriorly as well. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm and probably to a greater extent than the opposite side.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle where out laterally the cortical bone does not appear to be as intact as over medially where it appears to be intact but is very thin. The condyle appears narrow anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is extremely steep particularly at the lateral aspect. Articular disc is not as well seen out laterally as it is medially. Out laterally it appears to be anteriorly displaced. Condyle appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa. More medially, the disc appears to be in a little bit better anteroposterior position. Over medially, there may be a small osteophyte on the head of the condyle. No significant inflammatory response is seen in the joint.

On opening, the disc appears to reduce, and there is moderately good translation of the condyle and disc.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposteriorly particularly in the mid part of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep but not nearly as steep or as long as the opposite side. Out laterally, the articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced, but more medially it appears to be in a little bit better position. In fact, toward the most medial aspect of the joint it appears as though the disc could even be posteriorly displaced demonstrating perhaps a significant rotation of the disc within the joint. No significant inflammatory process is seen.

On opening, the condyle has better translation on this side, and the disc appears to be in position.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction

B285  CT Scan 
The i-CAT scan shows that in the right sinus she has some maxillary sinusitis with some thickening of the membrane particularly at the inferior and lateral aspect. Also in the anterior aspect there is some swelling of the tissues. The left sinus looks fairly clear. Turbinates are small in size. There appears to be some slight deviation in the septum but not too significant. The nasal airways look good.

Panorex view shows the presence of the bone screws and bone plates in the maxilla and mandible. Both condyles show significant arthritic changes.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows good facial balance and good oropharyngeal airway as well as a good Class I cuspid and skeletal relationship.

Left TMJ coronal view shows that the lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly significantly compared to normal. The condyle has some osteophytic growths off the top part of the condyle and a lateral exophytic growth extending out towards the lateral rim of the fossa. On the left side there appears to be some erosions in the head of the condyle on the superior surface and looks fairly rough. There are some degenerative changes up in the fossa as well. The lateral osteophyte may touch against the lateral rim of the fossa. This could be a source of pain and discomfort for her. The joint space actually looks reasonably good in both joints.

In the right joint there is significant downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. In fact, on both sides it covers most of the head of the condyle. The joint space looks fairly good. The cortical bone on the top looks fairly good. However, there appears to be a pseudocyst inside the condylar head or at least some erosion there. For the most part, the right condyle appears fairly well intact. Fossa may show some slight degenerative changes there. The lateral rim curves inferiorly quite significantly.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe degenerative changes and a lot of resorption along the posterior aspect of the condyle. There is some anterior beaking present more towards the lateral aspect of the joint. The fossa may show some degeneration. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There are some little bumps in the posterior functional surface of the articular eminence. Mitek anchors seen.

Right TMJ shows significant resorption at the posterior aspect of the condylar head. Anchors in place. At least half of the AP dimension of the condyle is gone. Both joint spaces appear to be relatively normal and could accommodate a disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis.

Date of Interpretation: 

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle where there appears to be some decreased joint space around it. Mitek anchor is in place. Difficult to identify discal tissue. There appears to be some degenerative changes in the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a Mitek anchor in it. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically. It is difficult to identify discal tissue. There may be some degenerative changes in the fossa.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows that the disc appears to be posteriorly displaced behind the head of the condyle. There appears to be degenerative changes on the articular eminence. No significant inflammation seen in the joint. There does appear to be soft tissue surrounding the articular disc. On opening, there is restricted movement and the disc remains posteriorly displaced. The restricted translation could indicate the possibility of significant adhesions present within this joint. The posterior aspect of the articular eminence appears to have reactive bone deposit on it. There appears to be some significant reactive tissue surrounding the disc. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There are arthritic changes of the condyle with flattening of the anterior aspect towards the lateral side with flattening of the posterior head more medially. There is some anterior beaking presents towards the medial side.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes. Articular eminence is relatively shallow towards the mid part of the joint and a little bit steeper out laterally. Articular disc appears to be in good position in the mid portion of the condyle but may be rotated slightly forward at the lateral aspect and slightly posteriorly at the medial aspect. On opening, the disc is posteriorly displaced and the condyle rotates and translates anterior to the disc along the articular eminence although there is restricted opening.

IMPRESSION
Left TMJ arthritis with posterior dislocation of the articular disc and surrounded by the soft tissue.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular in reasonable position in the closed attitude but the disc appears to be posteriorly displaced upon opening.
