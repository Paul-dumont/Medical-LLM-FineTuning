B025
B025 is 13 years old. Referred by Dr. XXXX. B025 is here with the primary concerns of:
Misaligned teeth and jaw.
Overbite. Difficulties breathing through the nose.

B025 is unsure when any jaw joints problems began and etiology is unknown. She had previous orthodontics from about the second grade through the fifth grade (approximately age 7 to 10 years old) where she had expanders, head gear for 1-1/2 years, and braces by a Dr. XXXX. She moved back about 5 years ago and has been under the care of Dr. XXXX.

B025 gets an occasional headache in the frontal and temporal area at about a level of 3. She has no overt TMJ pain or pain around the head and neck area. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability at 0. She has no problems with earaches, but has some moderate tinnitus and some vertigo, particularly when she stands up or gets up from lying down. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism.

In frontal view, B025 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 5 mm is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is deviated just slightly to the left side. The mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm to the left. The chin is slightly to the left. The mandibular dental midline and chin midline are fairly well aligned with each other. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is probably about 5 mm AP deficient. The lower third face is elongated vertically. She has some lip incompetence of probably close to 8 mm. The chin is retruded about 20 mm. The chin neckline is short, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. Intraorally, B025 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She appears to have adequate attached gingiva. Teeth seem to be nicely aligned and leveled. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. She has about a 2 mm over bite relationship and about a 4 mm Class II elastic on the right side and 5 mm on the left side. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Tonsils are mild to moderately enlarged. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged at least anteriorly. She has a wide columella and narrow nostrils. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, she has a very soft click in the left joint about 30 mm and a closing click about 20 mm. The right side seemed to function a little bit more smoothly. The incisal opening is 51 mm, excursion movement to the right side about 8 mm, to the left side about 5 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of four developing but unerupted third molars. The rest of the teeth are all present. The right sinus looks clear, but the left sinus may have fluid mass in the sinus. Joints look somewhat arthritic and condyles appear small. When the x-ray was taken, apparently she was posturing her mandible forward because in the left joint she has a significantly increased superior and posterior joint space and the condyle is postured downward on the articular eminence. The articular eminence is fairly steep. The condyle is small in size and has a little bit of hockey stick shape to it. Right TMJ likewise is postured down and forward not quite as much as the opposite side. The articular eminence is steep, but not quite as steep as the opposite side. There is an increased superior and posterior joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has moderately good width and the condyle may be a little bit short in vertical dimension. The lateral rim curves inferiorly 3 to 4 mm. There is some decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that may have lost some vertical volume. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 4 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space.

Coronal radiograph shows that the turbinates are moderate in size with the left one being excessively large. There is a significant fluid mass in the left sinus whereas the right sinus is reasonably clear with just some thickening of the sinus membrane lining at the floor of the sinus.

Axial view shows that the turbinates are moderately enlarged, particularly the left one is quite enlarged. The left sinus is pretty much filled with fluid.

Basic diagnoses for B025 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ adolescent internal condylar resorption (AICR).
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia, but anterior vertical hyperplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
AP microgenia.
Class II occlusion. High occlusal plane angle of 21 degrees (normal 8 degrees).
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Wide columella and narrow nostrils. Nasal airway obstruction. Impacted third molars x4. Mucous retention cyst versus fluid in the left maxillary sinus.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. MRI of left and right TMJs.
2. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract.
3. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it, move the anterior aspect superior, and posterior aspect inferiorly as well as decrease the occlusal plane angle. d.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy. f.	Surgical removal of impacted third molars. g.	Removal of mucous retention cyst left sinus. h.	Columella reconstruction.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B025 MRI
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that looks a little large for the fossa. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced, more so at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit smaller in size. The articular disc appears anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint, but more medially is in better position.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good medial width. Vertical joint space appears narrow. It appears that there may be some discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. The left articular eminence is fairly steep and somewhat elongated. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and articular disc and the disc is in a reduced position on wide opening.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears fairly large with good mediolateral width. The disc appears to be medially displaced. There appears to be some decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. The lateral pole appears to extend beyond the rim of the fossa. There is fairly good translation of the right disc and condyle with the disc going back into a reduced position fairly early on in the opening process.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with reduction on opening. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced but with early reduction.
