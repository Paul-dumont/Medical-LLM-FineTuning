I am referring __ to you for orthodontic treatment. B253 is 42 years old and has had longstanding TMJ problems and in fact may have ankylosing spondylitis that is affecting her neck and TMJs. In addition, at a younger age, I believe that she had developed an osteochondroma/osteoma of the right condyle that created severe facial asymmetry. B253's primary concerns are as follows:

Cannot open mouth wide and it particularly affects her ability to have dental work done.
Headaches in the back of the head.
Significant facial asymmetry.

Based on clinical, radiographic and MRI analyses, B253's diagnoses are as follows:
Previous actively growing osteochondroma/osteoma of the right TMJ.
Right TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and perforation.
Left TMJ osteoarthritic changes with significant loss of condylar volume and non-identifiable disc.
Right mandibular body and ramus vertical hyperplasia.
Significant facial asymmetry with the right cuspids 5 mm lower than the left cuspids creating a significant transverse cant of the occlusal plane angulation.
Missing all 4 first bicuspids. Class II end-on occlusion on the right side, Class I on the left side.
Impacted maxillary third molars x2.
Headaches.
Neck pain.
Limited jaw opening and function.
Significantly decrease oropharyngeal airway of 3 mm (normal 11 mm.)

RE: B253

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch
CT scan of TMJs and jaws (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ condylectomies, debridement, reconstruction with mandibular advancement using TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Bilateral coronoidectomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward and level transversely with bone plates and hydroxyapatite grafting.
Right mandibular ramus inferior border ostectomy removing approximately 11 mm of bone.
Surgical removal of impacted maxillary third molars x2.
Application of surgical stabilizing appliances.

I feel this treatment plan would get B253the best possible functional and esthetic result. Orthodontics is pretty much straight forward and just aligning and leveling of the archs is required at this time.

If you have any other thoughts, suggestions or questions in reference to treatment recommendations, please contact me. I very much look forward to the opportunity in working with you in correcting her concerns and problems.

With best regards,


B253 MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Reading: 
Joint sides are not labeled.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit smaller in size anteroposteriorly and appears to have lost some vertical volume. The condyle does appear arthritic. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The disc may be medially displaced. T2 image shows there may be a little bit of inflammation posterior to the condylar head. The open views show that there is significantly decreased joint space between the condyle and the articular eminence. There is moderate translation of the condyle. There is some type of dense tissue posterior to the head of the condyle. It is possible this could be discal tissue but very difficult to tell. However, in the T1 images discal tissue is not evident and the disc may be severely degenerated. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic with anterior beaking. Articular eminence is somewhat shallow and has sort of an odd shape to it. A little osteophyte is sticking up from the posterosuperior head. Anterior beaking is present. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is actually a fairly significant osteophyte sticking up from the superior head of the condyle more towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Decreased joint space superiorly. Significantly decreased joint space between the osteophyte and the roof of the fossa. Disc appears anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed and degenerated. T2 images do not demonstrate any significant evidence of inflammation. Open views show that there is restricted translation of the condyle and some areas of indistinguishable space between the fossa, articular eminence and condyle. Disc appears to be anteriorly displaced without reduction. In the open view the osteophyte is very evident and the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction and severely degenerated.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that quite narrow mediolaterally. There is evidence of significant condylar resorption present. There appears to be some medial beaking of the condylar head. There is decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. The condyle is well confined in the lateral rim of the fossa. It is very difficult to identify discal tissue in this view. T2 views show there may be some inflammation posterior to the head of the condyle and the bilaminar tissues.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite wide but has decreased contrast in the condylar head. There is an osteophyte in the mid portion of the condyle extending superiorly with probable perforation. The condyle has fairly good mediolateral width. The fossa appears somewhat degenerated as well. There may be some discal tissue medial and perhaps anterior. T2 images show no evidence of inflammation.

IMPRESSION
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocations without reductions.
Probably candidate for total joint prostheses.
B253

B253's problems may have begun as far back as in high school when she could push on her jaw and make it pop of unknown etiology. She began developing some facial asymmetry early. She became aware of it when she was in college. This would have been in the early 80s. B253 feels that it has not changed too significantly since her college years.

PRIMARY CONCERNS
Cannot open mouth wide and it particularly affects her ability to have dental work done. Headaches in the back of the head. Significant facial asymmetry. The only medication she takes is Aleve for her headache and neck problems. She reports no problems with earaches, tinnitus, and gets only occasional vertigo usually related to when she stands up quickly. Other joints that bother her include her neck and her right knee. She feels that she may be getting effusion to the vertebrae in her neck. She is unaware of clenching and bruxism. She is unmarried and lives by herself. She had some blood tests taken and she had an elevated rheumatoid factor and was told that she possibly could have ankylosing spondylitis but this has not been confirmed. She gets headaches about 2 times a week in the posterior head area at about a level of 4. No particular TMJ pain. She rates her average pain at about a level of 4. She rates her jaw function at 4, diet at 2, disability at 0.

In frontal view, B253 has very good symmetry in the middle and upper third face. The lower third face does demonstrate asymmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm on the left and about 2.5 on the right. Maxillary midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline although the roots are shifted off a little bit towards the right side. Mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the right but chin is about 7 mm off to the left. It is probably close to a 15 mm vertical discrepancy of the inferior border on the left side as compared to the inferior border on the right side of the mandible. In profile view, B253 has deficiency in maxillary projection by probably at least 4 mm. Chin is retruded by probably 15 to 18 mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short and not defined. B253 has had all 4 first bicuspids distracted. There is a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right but Class I on the left side. She is has an anterior deep bite of probably about 5 to 6 mm. She has good attached gingiva on the anterior arch. Right cuspid may be 1 mm posterior to the lower arch. Upper arch appears a little bit more symmetric anteroposteriorly. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane demonstrates the left teeth with the cuspids 5 mm higher than the right cuspids. Intranasally, B253 has a fairly significant deviated septum but the turbinates are small in size. She reports that she believes she breathes through her nose at night when she sleeps. On opening, there is some very fine crepitus in the right TMJ and the left one seems to function a little bit more smoothly. Incisal opening is about 30 mm and that includes the 5 mm vertical overbite relationship. Excursive movement to the right is about 6 mm and to the left 3 mm. Maximal opening is about 30 mm. Because of limited opening, it is very difficult to see the uvula. In fact, could not see it except for the very anterior base of it. The soft palate looked okay. I could not see the oropharynx. B253 has significant limited rotation movements of the neck and also significantly limited extension of the neck. She also has severe limitation of her ability to tip her neck from side-to-side.

B253 Page 2
This is indicative of probably some significant neck involvement that is creating limited movement.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of impacted maxillary third molars. All 4 first bicuspids have been extracted. It possibly could have been the maxillary second bicuspids but at the lower first bicuspids. She has an enlarged condyle indicative of probably either an arrested osteochondroma/osteoma versus condylar hyperplasia. The left condyle cannot be seen very well. Sinuses look relatively clear. Vertical height of the mandible is excessively long on the right side as compared to the left side. The left side actually does appear to have normal vertical body height. So again, this would probably go along with an osteochondroma/osteoma situation on that right side that is probably arrested at this time.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. There is some deviation of the septum. Turbinates do not appear too large. There is significant cant in the occlusal plane with probably a 5 to 6 mm vertical difference. The inferior border of the mandible on the right side is probably almost 20 mm lower than the left side. Right angle curves inward and the left angle curves outward a moderate amount.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have undergone significant degenerative changes. Articular eminence is moderately steep but difficult to tell. Joint space appears quite narrow. The condyle appears quite short vertically.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of abnormal shape to it. Significantly decreased joint space vertically and anteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Posterior joint space looks relatively normal but superior joint space and anterior are significantly decreased. On opening, there is a little bit greater translation on the left side as compared to the right side. On the right side, the condyle approaches just down toward the posterior aspect of the articular eminence.

Lateral cephalogram shows that the maxilla and mandible are both retruded. There is a definite vertical discrepancy at the inferior border of the mandible being about 15 mm longer on the right side as compared to the left side. There is also significant vertical discrepancy in the occlusal plane angle being probably about 5 mm of the cuspid area but closer to 8 mm back in the second molar area. Oropharyngeal airway is significantly decreased with an AP dimension of only about 3 to 4 mm at the soft palate level (normal 11 mm.) At the base of the tongue there is probably 4 mm of airway space.

OTHER SYSTEMS
B253 states she has no urinary tract problems. She has fibrocystic breast problems but no other reproductive system problems that she is aware of. She has had pink eye a couple of times that she got from the kids where she works at _____.

B253 Page 3
No sinus problems. She does not smoke. No ear symptoms or problems. She has to clear her throat a lot but otherwise has no respiratory system problems. No GI problems. She was treated for papilloma virus about 8 to 10 years ago. She does have low energy level at times. She has a heart murmur. She had a finch for 2 years. She had a chicken for about 3 to 4 months when she was younger. Her brother has about 12 chickens and some ducks but she is only there on holidays. She had been around cats that her friends have but that is not her favorite animal. She has had dogs most of her life but none of them have really been bird catchers or eaters. She had a horse growing up and her uncles had cows next door but she really did not have a lot of exposure. She has no implants. She is allergic to duck eggs. She does have food allergies to peanuts, strawberries and possibly almonds.

B253
The patient presents for a 27-month followup after bilateral TMJ reconstruction and TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses and maxillary osteotomies. She has a little noise that she occasionally gets in her left joint. It is nonpainful and does not occur all the time. She has ankylosing spondylitis that affects her back, right knee, and left ankle. She is on medications including:

Methotrexate 5 mg per week.
Prednisone 2 doses every 2 months prior to her Remicade infusion.
Remicade IV infusion q.2 months. Vitamins and supplements.

She has no earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No headaches, no TMJ pain, no pain around the head and neck area. She rates her jaw function at 4, diet at 2, disability at 0. Incisal opening with a little bit of help was 30 mm and excursion to the right 2 mm and to the left 3 mm. She has not been exercising her jaws and she realizes this. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. I suggested that she should try and do the exercises as this could perhaps increase her opening some and help maintain her current opening. For the most part, she is doing very well. Occlusion looks good. She is to return to see me in 3 years for a 5-year followup.
