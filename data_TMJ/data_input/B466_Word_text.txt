B466 
B466 is 41 years old and is referred by Dr. XX.
B466  does have some asthma problems, but otherwise, she is in good health. She had previous tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy and a rhinoplasty. She takes Singulair 10 mg per day and Advair 250/50 two times per day. She also takes vitamins.

Patient Concerns
Crepitation, left TMJ.
Clicking, right TMJ.
Patient History
B466's problems began with her jaw joint sometime around 23 years ago when she was in dental school, of unknown etiology. Through the years 18 years ago and then again 7 years ago she had night guards made. She had orthodontics from the age of 13 to 15 and had 4 first bicuspids extracted at that time. She has been pretty much asymptomatic for the most patient. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, headaches nor TMJ pain. She has no pain around the head or neck area. She rates her jaw function and diet at 2, disability at 0. She has scoliosis, but no other joint problems. She may have nocturnal clinching and bruxism.

Clinical Examination
On frontal view, B466 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Dental midlines are pretty much on the facial midline. In profile, B466 has fairly good facial balance. Chin-neckline may be just a little bit short, although facial proportions look fairly good. Intraorally, B466 is missing lower first bicuspids and upper first bicuspids. There is basically a Class-I cuspid-molar relationship and she has about 2 mm anterior overbite relationship. Intraorally, uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all look relatively normal. Intranasally, turbinates are slightly enlarged. Septum has some deviation to it with it going a little bit off towards the right side. It is difficult to tell if there is any nasal airway obstruction. B466 says when she sleeps she has her jaws open and she thinks she breathes through her nose. To palpation, B466 has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Maximal size opening is 50 mm. Excursion movement to the right is 9 mm and to left 10 mm. On opening, she has a click or almost like a glitch in the right TMJ at 5 to 10 mm of opening and closing probably about 5 mm. On the left side, she has some crepitus kind of movements.

B466 has had orthodontic appliances on for the second time since last yearf.
 
Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absent fourth third molars and all 4 first bicuspids. Sinuses look clear. Right condyle has a little bit of anterior lipping and a little sclerosis in the epicondyles and some flattening on the anterior head. Right side looks more normal morphology.

Tomogram left TMJ shows some anterior beaking present. There may be some decreased vertical dimension between the posterior aspect of the articular eminence and the head of the condyle. Posterior joint space may be slightly decreased, but not too significant. There appears to be vertical joint space present. In the right TMJ the condyle has a better shape. Also appears to be decreased joint space between the head of the condyle and the posterior aspect of the articular eminence. A little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence appears slightly steeper on this side as compared to the opposite side. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles and they both come forward beyond the articular eminence.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clears. A little bit of deviation to the nasal septum is present.
Also cephalometric radiograph shows there is some anterior vertical maxillary access. Mandible may be a little bit AP deficient. Mandible may be long vertically. Oropharyngeal is slightly decreased but appears essentially normal.

Basic Diagnoses
B466's diagnoses are as follows:
Left TMJ significant arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and significant deformation.
Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
High-occlusive plane angle.
Class-I occlusion.
Missing all 4 first bicuspids.
High-occlusive plane angulation and some decreased angulation of maxillary incisors.

Recommendation and treatment will be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics A. Align and level maxillary arch. B. Align and level mandibular arch.

Surgery
A. Left TMJ reconstruction with one of the following methods.
1. Left TMJ articular disc repositioning with Mitek Anchor (disc appears non- salvageable, therefore, this technique will probably not work.)
2. Left TMJ reconstruction with sternoclavicular disc graft (this may have a little bit better chance of being successful compared to option 1, but the risk of adhesions is high because of the arthritis that affects both the condyle and fossa.
3. Consider total joint prosthesis with fat graft from the abdomen. (This would be the most predictable, but she currently is asymptomatic.)

Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxilla superiorly and posterior maxilla inferiorly.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance to the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Anterior genioplasty to shorten the chin vertically and advance it slightly.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.  MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of :
Left TMJ, sagittal view, condyle has some significant anterior beaking present. Some degenerative changes in the condylar head with some changes in the trabecular pattern near the surface. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be more degeneration towards the lateral aspect of the joint than medial. At the lateral aspect, it appears that there is bone-on-bone contact. The condyle appears quite dark in the anterior half of the head. There are little degenerative changes in the fossa as well. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. This is extremely short anteriorly and posteriorly and is thickened, but there is severe deformation of the disc. She has a little bit of fluid in the anterior joint space. This is severely deformed. This is a little osteophyte sticking up off the top of the condyle. There is not much inflammation in the joint area.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows the condyle has a little bit of morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Laterally it is very difficult to see any evidence of the discal tissue. It is very difficult to identify the boundaries of the disc in the right joint. Condyles are a little bit flattened on the anterior head, but in much better condition than the opposite side.

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows that there is a depression present in the head of the condyle about the mid condyle portion. Decreased joint space to the lateral aspect of the joint where there appears to be almost bone-on-bone contact towards the anterior part of the condyle. There is discal tissue anteriorly positioned and some lateral displacement of the articular disc.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows the condyle is fairly shaped except for the lateral aspect at the head and has a little flattened contour. Joint space is decreased at the lateral aspect of the joint. Difficult to find any discal tissue.

Right T2. It appears that the articular disc may in fact be in position on this side. No significant inflammation seen.
Open view, left TMJ shows good translation of the condyle. Articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. Some anterior beaking is still seen in the open views. Significantly decreased joint space is present between the eminence and the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ, open sagittal view, shows good morphology and good joint space between the condyle and the articular eminence. It appears that the discal tissue is in place.

Coronal open views, left TMJ, shows that there appears to be bone-on-bone contact at the lateral aspect of the joint.
Right TMJ, open view, shows decreased joint space between the coronal head and the articular eminence. Head looks a lot more healthy on the right side than it does on the left side.

Impression:
Left TMJ significant arthritis and articular disc desiccation without reduction.
Right TMJ mild arthritis. It appears that the disc is in normal position.
