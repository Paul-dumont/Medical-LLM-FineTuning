B186
B186 is 16 years 11 months and 3 weeks old. Referred by Dr. XXXX. B186 is in good health with no major medical problems. B186's primary concerns are as follows:

Jaws lock.
Jaws click and pop.
Pain when eating.
B186 has had his wisdom teeth removed 7 months ago. B186's joint problems began when he was about 12 years old of unknown etiology. He has had no treatment to date. B186 rates his headaches at a level of 5 and they occur in the temporal area and are worse when he eats. He rates his TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 4, jaw function at 7, diet at 7, disability at 3. He gets earaches and tinnitus occasionally as well as vertigo. Other joints that bother him include his left wrist, knees, and ankles. Being a hockey player though may contribute to some of his joint problems. He has been diagnosed with ADHD. He is not aware of clenching or bruxism.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B186 does have good facial symmetry and balance. He has got problems with his masseter muscles. In profile, he has good facial balance. Intraorally, B186 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. There is some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has a good Class I cuspid-molar relationship bilaterally, and he has about a 2 mm vertical overbite. Intranasally, the septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side and turbinates are moderate in size. To palpation, he has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, he has clicking in both joints and actually multiple clicks on the right side and does not click quite as much as usual on his left side. The incisal opening is 55. The excursion movements are 11 mm in each direction. The opening clicks are somewhere around 15 mm and there are closing clicks around 10 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses look clear. Turbinates appears moderate in size. Bony septum at least appears straight. Difficult to evaluate the joints.

Coronal view shows that he has hypertrophied turbinates particularly on the right side. Sinuses look reasonably clear with just a little bit fluid with a little retention cyst in the right sinus along the medial wall. The septum is deviated with a spur off towards the left side and then deviates off a little bit towards the right side near the superior aspect of the septum.

Axial view shows that the right turbinate is moderately enlarged, and the left one appears a little bit normal. Sinuses appear relatively clear except for a little mucous retention area in the posterior medial recess of the maxillary sinus.

Left TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposteriorly. There are some degenerative changes present. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The anterior joint space is increased.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposteriorly, but not quite as much as the opposite side. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The joint space appears adequate with some slight increase anteriorly.

Left TMJ coronal view shows flattening on the condylar head. The joint space appears reasonably good, although slightly decreased at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better shape than the opposite side and there appears to be an adequate joint space. There is some slight decrease at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B186 has fairly good AP and vertical facial balance and appears to have a good Class I and skeletal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 8 mm at the base of the tongue and probably about 6 mm at the soft palate level.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction. Mandibular hyperplasia. TMJ pain.
Headaches.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. b.	Bilateral ramus osteotomies to maintain the occlusion and allow the condyle to move down and forward to create space for the articular disc.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B186 MRI AGE: 16/M
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears narrow mediolaterally. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat. There seems to be reasonable joint space present.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat small in size. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat. There is some joint space present.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has significant resorption vertically and anteroposteriorly. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting down almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc must be medially displaced as well as it not as identifiable towards the lateral aspect of the joint as it is medially. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There appears to be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space towards the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle and reduction of the articular disc. However, the disc itself does not move much at all. There is some anterior beaking on the condyle at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better morphology than the opposite side. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. On opening, the disc reduces and there is some restriction of translation of the condyle. The disc itself does not appear to move significantly.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs anteriorly displaced with reduction on opening, but without translation of the discs indicative of adhesions to the fossa.
