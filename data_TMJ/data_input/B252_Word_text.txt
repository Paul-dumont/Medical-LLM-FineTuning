B252 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. Her occlusion is very good. I cleaned out her airway. She is in good spirits, although a little bit more tired today than yesterday. Otherwise, she is progressing well and to return to see me in 1 day. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. Reduced elastics by one on each side.

B252 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well, but not feeling quite so good today and having a little bit of depression. Occlusion is good. She is a little tachycardic and blood pressure was a little bit low. I suctioned out her airway and her nasal airway is good. She is getting plenty of fluids down. She is progressing fairly well except for a little bit of down side today, but No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She does have a little bit of a yeast buildup intraorally. Therefore, I gave her a prescription for Nystatin 100,000 units/mL, dispensing 200 mL, 1 tsp. q.i.d., rinse mouth thoroughly, hold for 5 minutes and swallow. She is to use it 6 times today, but then go to the 4 times a day after that.

B252 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion is fairly good. She went and saw Dr. . He placed her on some elastics that are uncomfortable for her. I changed her elastics and placed a light Class II on the left side and a vertical elastic in the left cuspid area. Otherwise, she is doing well. I suctioned out her nose with very minimal return. Because she is having a little trouble sleeping, I gave her a prescription for Klonopin 1-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s.

He is to change out the upper arch wire and then she is to return to see me after that at which time I will remove the palatal splint. She is to contact me if she has any concerns and problems. She is doing very well.

B252 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion is good. She is in good spirits. She went to see Dr. ___ this morning, and he placed her on fairly heavy elastics anteriorly around the upper four and lower four incisors and a heavy Class II elastic on the left side. She is to wear a heavy elastics on the right side. He did a send verbal message that I could change those if I felt necessary. I did change them to lighter elastics. I also gave her jaw exercises to do. She is progressing well, in great spirits, and to return to see me in 2 weeks. Her next appointment with Dr. _____ is in 6 weeks.

B252 presents for followup evaluation. She is doing very well. Occlusion is pretty good. Just slightly open in the molar area. Today I took off her elastics and just placed her on some rabbits in a triangular fashion around the mandibular first and second molars and upper first molars. She is in good spirits and doing well. Incisal opening is 32 mm. She really has no complaints or issues at this time. She has an appointment with Dr. ___ in 3 weeks and she is to return to see me in 3 weeks.

B252 
B252 is 15 years old, referred by Dr. ___ . B252's TMJ problems began when she was about 12 years of age of unknown etiology. She completed first stage orthodontic treatment 4 years ago and was placed in some retainers. Dr. __ did not see her again until about 2 months ago, and B252's bite has significantly changed during that time interval. She gets occasional tinnitus and moderate vertigo. She gets headaches now about every other day that occur predominantly in the frontal and temporal areas. She does not really have any TMJ problems per se. She rates her average daily pain at 1, jaw function at 2, and disability at 0. Other joints that bother her includes her knees and ankles. She has been diagnosed as having:

Lupus anticoagulant.
Abnormal homosistine levels.
She is being followed by Dr. __. Primary concerns that B252 has include the following:

Change in her bite.
Headaches.
Excessive wearing of the back teeth.
She takes the following medications:
Fexofenadine 180 mg q.d.
Flonase.
Slow Fe.
Folic acid.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B252 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, she has fairly good facial balance. There is just some slight AP deficiency in the prediction of the mandible. Chin is fairly strong. Chin neckline is fairly close to normal in length and chin neck angle is well defined. Intraorally, Maria has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. Teeth are fairly well aligned. She has fairly good attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has almost a full Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally and she has about to 5 to 6 mm overjet. She has an open bite of about 2 mm. She has a slight accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. Oropharyngeal tissues looks normal and healthy. She occludes predominantly on the first and second molars bilaterally. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum is fairly straight. There is some mild nasal obstruction, but not too significant. To palpation, she has some moderate tenderness to palpation over the TMJs, but nowhere else in the head and neck area. She has an opening click at about 30 mm in the right joint and about 20 mm with closing. The left side seems to function reasonably smoothly. Incisal opening maximally is about 60 mm, and she could open to about 45 mm without significant pain and discomfort. Excursion movements are 8 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Radiographic evaluation shows that she has four impacted third molars. Condyles appear small in size and it appears they may have degenerative changes. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates look moderately enlarged. Waters view shows the septum is fairly straight. Turbinates appear fairly large and some of this enlargement may be posteriorly. There seems to be a constricted nasal airway. Sinuses look relatively clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows that she is not in centric occlusion when this x-ray was taken. The mandible appears to be postured forward in the fossa. The condyle appears small in size and there is some anterior beaking. Articular eminence is moderate in steepness. She does have impacted third molars x2 on this side. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is a little bit small. Joint space may be relatively normal. A little bit of anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. The patient is in a little bit better Class II position. Condyle is postured less far forward as compared to the opposite side. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B252 has a high occlusal plane angle in facial morphology. She has an anterior open bite and a Class II malocclusion. Oropharyngeal airway is somewhat constricted to the lateral incisors. There is fairly angulation relative to the mandibular basal bone. She does have some increased soft tissue thickness in the progonion. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue is reduced about 5 mm and at the soft palate about 11 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B252 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ adolescent internal condylar resorption. Severe AP mandibular hypoplasia. Transverse maxillary hypoplasia. Class II end-on occlusion. High occlusal plane angle.
Occludes only on the first and second molars. Anterior open bite of about 2 to 3 mm. Headaches. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Mouth breathing particularly at night. Impacted third molars x4.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Open up about 1 mm of space between the upper laterals and cuspids to help correct her tooth size discrepancy. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to expand it and advance it slightly. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B252 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Incisal opening is 38 mm. Excursion movements are 3 mm in each direction. She is very comfortable. Occlusion looks great. Nasal airway is good. She really has no complaints or problems. She is progressing very well and to return to see me in 3 months.

B252 
B252 is 6 months post surgery and doing very well. Her occlusion looks very good. She has really no complaints at this time. She is happy with her outcome. She is to return to see us in 6 months for a 1 year followup

Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit small in size and appears to have perhaps lost some vertical dimension and volume. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. There is decreased superior joint space. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condylar head. There could be some lateral disc displacement.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears slightly larger than the left side, but there is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle and with a little bit of lateral displacement.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic and may have lost some vertical dimension. There is some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced and siting almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc is foreshortened anteroposteriorly. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced and nonreducing with significantly degenerative changes.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have some areas of bone loss. The condyle appears quite small out laterally. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced sitting down almost beneath the articular eminence. Out laterally, the posterior band is extremely thick. Over medially, the disc is not as readily seen. On opening, there is moderate translation, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction. MRI findings may be compatible with AICR.
