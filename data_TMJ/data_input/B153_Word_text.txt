B153
B153 is 18 years old. Primary concerns B153 has include the following:
Jaw joint pain.
Frequent headaches. Teeth only hit in 3 places.
Jaw opening is limited.
On opening, the jaw shifts towards the right side.

B153 had orthodontics from the age of 9 to 12. His TMJ problems began at about the age of 16. It is unknown exactly what caused the joint situation. B153 had his wisdom teeth removed three years ago and has also had two root canals that may be related to clenching of his teeth. Last year, he had significant problems with laryngeospasms due to acid reflux. He currently takes Prevacid 60 mg b.i.d. to control that and the only other medication he takes is Allegra. B153 did have splint therapy from ages 16 to 17.

B153 rates his headaches that are quite frequent at about a level of 6, and they occur in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area. They occasionally elevate to 9. He rates his TMJ pain at 8, with the right side worse than the left side. His average daily facial pain is at 3. He rates his jaw function at 8, diet at 6, disability at 2. He gets right-sided earaches occasionally and gets occasional tinnitus and occasional vertigo. Other joints that bother him include his fingers and occasionally his toes. He is aware of clenching at nighttime. He has had a previous ENT evaluation by Dr. XXXX who suggested nasal septoplasty and bilateral turbinectomies. B153 is aware of having some moderate snoring at times. He did have a sleep study done last year and nothing significant was found. He also has been diagnosed as having asthma. B153 was born 5 weeks premature.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B153 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about -1. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is just slightly to the left side by 1 or 2 mm. The mandibular dental midline is also to the left about 1 mm and the mandibular dental midline and chin are fairly well aligned with each other. In profile, upper lip supralabrale is just slightly posterior to subnasale. In profile, upper lip is retruded about 3 to 4 mm and chin is retruded about 10 mm. Chin neck is short and chin neck angle is moderately well defined. Intraorally, B153 has all of his teeth back through the second molars. Teeth are reasonably well aligned and level. There is a little bit of spacing between the lower anterior teeth. There is a little gingival inflammation around the maxillary lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has a slight Class III cuspid relationship on the right side by about 2 mm and about 1 or 2 mm also on the left side. He has an anterior cross bite and a slight anterior open bite of about 2 mm. Uvula is moderately hyperplastic. Otherwise, the rest of the tissues in the oropharyngeal airway look reasonably good. Posterior fascial pillars are a little bit posteriorly positioned. Intranasally, the septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged, particularly in the right side. B153 has moderate nasal airway obstruction. Columella is wide and nostrils are moderately narrowed. To palpation, he has moderate pain over the right TMJ, left masseter area, and milder tenderness over the right masseter, medial pterygoids, left TMJ, and retromandibular area. On opening, he could feel an occasional glitch in the right TMJ. Otherwise, the joints are reasonably smooth. On excursion movements, there was a click in the left joint on excursion towards the right side. Maximal incisal opening is 36 mm, opening without discomfort 19 mm. Excursion movement to the right was 7 mm and to the left 5 mm. On opening, the mandible does deviate towards the right side probably about 3 to 4 mm. B153 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm. There is a reverse curve of occlusion in the lower arch and a slightly accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch.

Basic diagnoses for B153 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ reactive arthritis versus connective tissue autoimmune disease. AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Slight Class III end-on occlusion. Anterior cross bite.
Moderately high occlusal plane angle. Hypertrophied turbinates. Deviated nasal septum off to the right side. Nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Reversed curve of Spee in the lower arch. Accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Evaluation by rheumatologist to rule out connective tissue autoimmune disease. Presurgical orthodontics. Continue to align and level the maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract. Try to elevate the lower incisors slightly to decrease the slight reverse curve of Spee. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen or buttock).
Bilateral coronoidotomies. Bilateral inferior partial turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

THIS IS A SECOND NOTE DICTATED ON B153 - SAME DAY -
I reviewed the report I had from a surgical MRI and further consultation with Dr. XXXX who agreed that there was pannus of tissue surrounding the disc. The fact that he has other joint problems could indicate that he has some kind of connective tissue autoimmune disease problem. I did tell him that the best option would be to do total joint prostheses. A second option would be to put the discs back in position, but the discs may not hold up well. After discussion with B153 and his father XXXX, the three options that B153 has would include:

Do the treatment as planned with repositioning of the articular discs and the orthognathic surgery.
Perform the orthognathic surgery only but expect worsening of the TMJ problems. Cancel surgery, complete the orthodontic treatment as best as possible and place in retainers with observation of the joints to see how the progress.

I did state that the total joint prostheses would be the most predictable treatment for him.
The father and the patient crossed out several of the potential risks as they did the same for their son Bradley. I informed them, and they fully understand particularly the father who is an attorney that even though they crossed those risks out, they need to understand that those risks can still occur and they were very much aware of that, but said they did not want to have those on there as that seemed as though they were giving permission for those complications to occur. Again, I emphasized and they both clearly understand that those are potential risks that can occur and crossing them out does not decrease or eliminate that risk.

B153 I-CAT AGE: DOB:
I-CAT coronal view shows a severe deviation in the nasal septum off towards the right side. Turbinates are moderately enlarged and appear to obliterate a good portion of the airway. Sinuses appear relatively clear. The condyles both appear reasonably large. Joint space, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint on the left side, appears somewhat narrow. In some views, the right side appears to have a narrow space as well.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with reasonably good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space looks reasonably good.
Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appear to have more a hockey stick shape than the opposite site, but joint space looks reasonably good. Articular eminence is moderately steep. He appears to have reasonably good oropharyngeal airway. He has an anterior cross bite.

Axial view shows that the condyles are quite mediolaterally, but relatively normal in anteroposterior dimension. Axial view also shows significant deviation in the nasal septum off to the right side. Turbinates are fairly large in size.

IMPRESSION:
Severely deviated nasal septum. Hypertrophied turbinates. Increased mediolateral width of both condyles.
Anterior cross bite. Anterior open bite.

B153 MRI AGE:
Left TMJ open view shows a very poor translation of the condyle. The disc appears to be in position, but somewhat degenerated. There appears to be almost like a pannus surrounding the disc.

Right TMJ open view shows a poor translation. The disc appears to be in position. Articular eminence is moderate steep. In some of the views, it appears that there is a pannus around the disc.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have pretty good morphology. It is difficult to identify exactly where the disc is.
Right TMJ closed view shows a condyle that appears to be a little bit arthritic. The disc appears to be in reasonably good position, but there appears to be some tissue between the disc and the condyle.

In the left joint in the closed view, it appears that the disc is in reasonable position, but there also appears to be soft tissue between the condyle and the disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis with discs that appear to be in reasonable position, but with a pannus between the condyle and the disc.
B153 MRI AGE: 19/M

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be discal tissue present but it appears to be medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased hilar joint space. It appears that the disc is medially displaced. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Sagittal view shows a condyle with mild arthritic changes with a little osteophyte sticking up off the middle of the condylar head. Out laterally, the bone appears a little bit rougher. The articular eminence is moderately steep. At the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc may be slightly anteriorly displaced. More medially, the disc appears to be in better position.

In some of the views, it looks like there could be reactive tissue surrounding the joint. In other views, particularly in the open views, the disc appears to be in pretty good position, although there is some better translation of the condyle than there is of the articular disc. On opening, there is moderately good translation and the disc looks more healthy and appears to be in position on wide opening.

In the right TMJ sagittal MRI, the condyle appears to have fairly good shape. There appears to be some tissue between the condyle, disc, and fossa. The disc appears to be in reasonably good position. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. There may be a small amount of fluid in the superior joint space. The articular eminence is fairly steep. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle and disc. The disc does not translate as far forward as the condyle indicating that there may be some adhesions present of the disc to the fossa. There appears to be some tissue in some of the views between the condyle and disc.

IMPRESSION:
Mild TMJ arthritis and articular disc medially displaced and possible slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc medially displaced but with reduction on opening with possible adhesions of the discs to the fossa.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc in fairly good position, but what appears to be reactive pannus surrounding the disc which is quite thin with possible adhesions of the articular disc to the eminence of the fossa. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with what appears a pannus surrounding the relatively thin disc and with probable adhesions of the disc to the articular eminence fossa area.
