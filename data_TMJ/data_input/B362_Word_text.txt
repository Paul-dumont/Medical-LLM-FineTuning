B362 
B362 is 41 years old.
Patient History
B362 's problems began approximately 15 years ago in reference to jaw joint problems, and it was related to chronic bruxism. The problem has been primarily on the right TMJ area. She has had previous locking and popping there. She has numerous splints during her 20s and 30s. She was put into orthodontics and underwent orthognathic surgery to “correct her TMJ problems.” She had orthodontic appliances placed 2 years ago by Dr. _ and then had a LeFort I maxillary setback and a mandibular setback and a chin shave done by Dr. _ 2 years ago. She had a resultant significant asymmetry in the chin and last year had a genioplasty done and some suturing up in the maxillary vestibule to help give her some cheek support. The second surgery was done by Dr. __.

Current Medications
The only medications that she currently takes are Advil for pain and vitamins. She also takes an occasional Ecotrin.
Patient Concerns

Primary concerns that B362 has at this time include the following:
Face too far back.
Her profile is deficient, and she would like better profile fullness and better chin contour.
Upper jaw is down too far and consequently showing too much gum particularly when she smiles.
Cheek tissue is too deficient.
Facial asymmetry with the left cheek being more full than the right side, right cheek lower than the left cheek, residual chin asymmetry, and the chin is too long in its present shape. The chin may also be too centered.
Severe TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Sleep disorder secondary to pain and the inability to relax her jaws.
Inability to relax her jaws, and her jaws always feel tense.
Difficulty eating and chewing.
Crunchy noises in the TMJs.
Difficulties breathing through her nose.
Excessive loose skin through the facial area.
Right earache.
Tinnitus with the right side being worse than the left side.
Nocturnal clenching and bruxism.
Back teeth don't touch.
Vertigo.

She has some numbness in the lower lip and chin area and also in the left cheek area.
B362 often wakes up with headaches in the morning, and she gets headaches about two times a week. She rates them at a level of 7 in the right fronto-temporal area and a 4 in the left fronto-temporal area. TMJ pain on the right side is at a 7, on the left side at 4, and overall pain at 5, jaw function at 8, diet at 6, and disability at 8.

To palpation, B362 has some moderate pain over the temporalis areas, TMJs, posterior neck, and right styloid area. She has milder pain over the left masseter area. In all those areas, the left side is a little bit worse than the right side.

Clinical Evaluation
In frontal view, B362 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Nasal tip is shifted off to the right side probably about 2 to 3 mm. Maxillary midline looks as though it is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline and chin transversely appear to be fairly well aligned. There is a little increased fullness vertically in the chin on the left side. She does exhibit a little bit of lip incompetence of about 5 mm. She shows about 3 mm of lower incisor above her lower lip. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2.5 mm.

In profile view, she may have some slight AP maxillary deficiency of maybe 2 to 3 mm. There is a little hyperfunction of the chin tissue. Chin may be just slightly AP deficiency particularly if the upper lip is filled out a little bit. Chin-neckline appears to be relatively normal in length. She does have some fullness in the submental area. Chin-neck angle is moderately well defined. If she postures her mandible forward a little bit, it does improve the overall profile.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She appears to have adequately attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth, although it is extremely thin in most of the areas. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She appears to have a good Class I cuspid-molar relationship. Occlusion looks fairly good although she feels that the posterior teeth don't touch very well. She has about a 1-mm vertical overbite. The oropharynx appears pretty much normal. Uvula is elongated. She doesn't know if she has any problems with snoring. Transversely, she seems to have fairly good symmetry.

Intranasally, she has a severely deviated nasal septum off toward the left side. Left turbinate is moderate in size and appears to actually touch against the septum. That airway is pretty much blocked off. On the right side, the turbinate is fairly large, but the airway is better on that side. If the septum, however, is straightened up, it might significantly decrease the functional airway. The septal deviation may account for some of the external nasal asymmetry with the tip of the nose shifted off toward the right side. She also has a moderately wide columella base. Nostrils are a little bit narrow but not too significantly.

Incisal opening maximally is about 38 mm and without too much discomfort about 30 mm. Excursive movements are about 6 mm in each direction.
On opening, she has a click in the left joint at about 10 mm and closing click at about the same. Right joint functions relatively smoothly.

On neurological evaluation, on two-point discrimination she has normal sensation in the upper lip with a point difference of 4 to 5 mm. In both sides of the lower lip and chin area, it was greater than 20 mm. Von Frey hairs was at 1.56 in the upper lip, 2.44 in the lower left lip, but negative in the chin area bilaterally and in the right lip. Brush stroke was normal in the upper lip, totally negative in the lower right lip, and missed probably 3 out of 5 directions at least in the lower left lip, although she could feel sensation there. Sharp was normal in the upper lip, hypersensitive in the lower left lip, but negative in the chin area and negative in the lower right lip. Cold sensation was relatively normal in the upper lip, and she eventually did feel it in the lower lip, but it was delayed in getting there. The right lower lip and chin areas were negative to sensation.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the presence of one bone plate in the left maxilla with five screws. There are three screws in each ramus along the superoanterior border. Evidence of previous genioplasty procedure is noted. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Condyles appear they may have some bony changes. Roots on the maxillary incisors appear quite short. They have apparently been short for a long time.

Waters view shows the nasal septum is significantly deviated off toward the left side. There is also a fairly good size septal spur present on the septa. Right turbinate is extremely large, and the right airway appears to be pretty much blocked. Left airway appears that there is some airway there, although clinically there is a difference in function. Bone plate is still present in the left jaw. There may be some slight vertical asymmetry in the angle area where the right angle appears to be a little bit lower than the left angle by about 2 to 3 mm. Otherwise, transversely jaws are reasonably symmetric.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Joint space actually looks reasonably good at these particular levels of cuts. Styloid processes are quite prominent and elongated. There appears to be some type of calcification out in front of the condyle underneath the articular eminence.

Left TMJ shows a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and a little anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is steeper on this side as compared to the opposite side. Condyle may be slightly posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Disc may be in a vertical orientation in the fossa along the articular eminence.

Opening view shows restricted translation in both TMJs. There appears to be calcification anterior to the condyle on the right side, and in the open view, the calcification still appears to be present.

Cephalometrically, the posterior position of the chin is evident. She appears to have a skeletal Class I occlusal relationship. Both maxillary and mandibular incisors are a little bit over-angulated. Oropharyngeal airway looks very good. There is a difference in the vertical height of the inferior border of the mandible with one side being 4 to 5 mm higher than the other side at the angle area and about 3 mm at the body area beneath the first molar.

Evaluation of her presurgical ceph and her postsurgical double-jaw surgery ceph show that the AP position of the maxilla and mandible was not changed significantly. The maxilla was actually moved superiorly perhaps about 1 mm. However, the upper lip shortened probably at least 2 mm with the maxillary surgical procedure. Subsequently, she had a “cheek lift” soft tissue procedure done, and this may have shortened the upper lip even further. The AP position of the chin is fairly symmetric as well. The inferior border of the mandible is more symmetric after the double-jaw surgery on the lateral ceph as compared to the presurgical ceph.

In superposing on the anterior structures of the x-ray we took today at this office as compared to her postsurgery, it shows that the chin has been shortened vertically probably approximately 3 mm and also moved posteriorly approximately 3 mm. Vertical position of the maxilla and AP position of the maxilla and mandible appear to be pretty much unchanged.

Bolton's analysis reveals no significant tooth-size discrepancy. Maxillary incisor crown length on the centrals is about 8.5 mm.
Basic Diagnoses
Basic diagnoses for B362 would be as follows:

Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations.
Maxillary hyperplasia and asymmetry.
Mandibular hypoplasia and asymmetry.
AP and vertical microgenia.
Headaches.
Severe TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain.
Deviated nasal septum.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction.
Mild tooth-size discrepancy.
Nasal deformity secondary to deviated nasal septum.
Paresthesia to lower left lip and total anesthesia to the right lip and chin and left chin area.
Traumatic injury to right inferior alveolar nerve.
Ptosis of the lower lip and chin area.

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics
Continue to align and level maxillary arch.
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing approximately 2 mm of tooth structure and retracting the incisors.

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward and move it superiorly and also shift the posterior aspect to the right.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to clockwise rotate the mandible and correct the asymmetry.
Exploration of right inferior alveolar nerve with microneurosurgical nerve repair.
Nasoseptoplasty.
Partial inferior turbinectomies.
Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to advance the chin and also lengthen it vertically with rigid fixation and HA grafting. Consider possible lateral augmentation with bone graft or synthetic materials to widen the mandible. Also consider a vertical midline osteotomy to expand the chin with a possible midline graft.
Resuspension of mentalis muscle.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B362  MRI Evaluation 
DOB: 
Date of Examination: 
Images are not labeled. I assume that image #1 will be the left side.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that actually has fairly reasonable shape. It does appear as though the disc is in position. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There could be a little bit of tissue surrounding the disc. A little sclerosis on the anterior head and some minor beaking but not too significant.

Right TMJ with a little more anterior beaking. A little sclerosis in the anterior head towards the medial side. More lateral, there appears to be slight increased joint space. Articular eminence is not quite as steep on this side as the opposite side. It appears in some views that the disc may be in place but towards the lateral aspect of the joint it appears that the disc may be anteriorly displaced and thickened.

Right TMJ coronal view shows that the condyle appears to have fairly good shape with some lateral extension of the condyle slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears there may be discal tissue anterolateral. There appears to be slight decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. It fits a little bit better into the fossa as compared to the opposite side. Joint space appears fairly well balanced. Disc may be in position. T2 left TMJ, assuming low numbers are the left side, shows disc that appears to be in fairly good position. However, there is fluid in the superior and inferior joint space.

At the lateral aspect of the joint which the low numbers presumably is the left side, the disc is a little bit anteriorly displaced and there is a decreased posterior joint space. In the right sagittal view, the disc appears to be more degenerated that the left side.

On the right side, at least medially, the disc appears to be in position although there is some fluid in the joint space. More lateral, it appears the disc may be anteriorly displaced and there appears to be decreased posterior joint space. It appears that the disc may be displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. Right TMJ moderate arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint but the disc appears more degenerated.
