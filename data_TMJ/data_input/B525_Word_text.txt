B525
B525 is 15 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX.

Patient History
Last month, B525 had her tonsils removed. Apparently she had lots of problems with tonsillitis, and her tonsils were huge even then noninflamed. B525 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her neck and her knees occasionally. She has usual environmental kind of allergies. If she wears cheap earrings, it can cause some ear problems for her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing her teeth at night. She had a tonsillectomy done last month. She was in a motor vehicle accident about 6 years ago, and about 2 years ago she fell down the stairs at school. About two or three years ago, she began for an unknown reason to develop locking in her jaw joints and clicking and popping. She really has not had any specific treatment to date yet. Dr. XXXX has been following her since she was about 8 or 9 years old but has not initiated treatment yet because he is still waiting for the permanent teeth to erupt in. About two or three years ago, B525's jaw began to start to lock up on her. She is not aware of any particular reason why the joints started to lock up on her. To date she has had no specific treatment for her situation.

Patient Concerns
Teeth don't fit together very well
Locking in the jaw joints
Clicking and popping in the jaw joints
Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B525 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 mm. Maxillary midline may be about a millimeter off to the left of the facial midline.

In profile view, she has a little bit of deficiency in the upper lip projection of probably about 3 to 4 mm. Lower lip is in fairly good balance with the upper lip, although the chin is somewhat prominent. Chin is anterior to the lower lip by probably 4 to 5 mm.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Left second bicuspid is just starting to erupt into the oral cavity . Lower incisors appear to be in lingual version. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth through the second molars. Upper lateral incisors look somewhat small. She has an end-on Class III cuspid relationship. She has an anterior overbite of about a millimeter. She has an open-bite greater on the left side from the lateral incisor back to the first molar. On the right side, there is a lesser degree of open bite, but still significant. B525 has bilateral posterior crossbites and end-on incisor relation. Teeth include the left maxillary first and second molar, mandibular second molar, four central incisors, right second bicuspid through second molar in the upper arch, and in the lower arch first and second molar.

To palpation, she has moderate pain over the TMJs and milder pain over the masseter and styloid areas. Joints seem to function reasonably smoothly at this particular time though she does say that her jaws occasionally get locked. Incisal opening is 48 mm. Excursive movements are 7 mm in each direction. On opening, the joints seem to function relatively smoothly at this particular time.

Radiographic Evaluation
The middle part of the Panorex is blocked off, so I cannot see the teeth from the left central incisor through the right first bicuspid in the upper arch and in the lower arch from lower cuspid to right second bicuspid. There are impacted mandibular third molars x 2 but do not see any maxillary third molars. The condyles appear to have fairly good morphology. Sinuses appear reasonably clear.

Waters view shows that there appears to be some deviation of the nasal septum back in the bony aspect. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. Sinuses appear clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is sort of moderate in steepness. Disc appears to be a little bit posteriorly positioned in the fossa with a slightly increased anterior space.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Joint space may be slightly decreased posteriorly. Articular eminence is a little bit more shallow on this side than the opposite side.

Open views show good translation of the condyles where the condyles come out beyond the articular eminences.
Basic Diagnoses
Rule out bilateral TMJ condylar hyperplasia and articular disc dislocations
AP maxillary deficiency
Transverse maxillary deficiency
Slight vertical maxillary excess
Mandibular prognathism
Class III occlusion Significant lingual inclination of lower incisors
AP soft tissue macrogenia
Impacted mandibular third molars x 2
Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 1.5 to 2 mm
Hypertrophied turbinates
Nasal airway obstruction
TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Headaches

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Consider opening up spacing around the upper lateral incisors of about a millimeter around each tooth to account for the tooth-size discrepancy. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Be careful not to expand the upper arch too much because she already has an accentuated curve of Wilson, and she will need surgical expansion anyway to get a good fit
Align and level mandibular arch. Try to tip lower incisor teeth forward as far as possible. This will likely create an anterior crossbite. If it does create an anterior crossbite, this will actually be to advantage

Continue to monitor growth for condylar hyperplasia and for TMJ disc dislocations
Consider possible repeat of MRI
Surgery
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to reposition the mandible in a clockwise direction
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward, expand it, and move the posterior aspect superiorly slightly
Partial turbinectomies
Removal of mandibular impacted third molars
Consider bilateral TMJ high condylectomies and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors if condylar hyperplasia is identified and/or disc displacements are confirmed

Date of Reading:

No coronal views are available.
Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit flattened on top particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially the condyle appears to have better confirmation. Out laterally the disc is not seen as well which could be indicative of a medial displacement. Otherwise disc appears to be in fairly good position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. At least some views show what appears to be an attempt to open with significant restriction, although the disc appears to be reduced in position. Translation is fairly minimal in the joint, if, in fact, these are open views. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening superiorly particularly toward the lateral aspect. More medially it has a little bit better confirmation. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. In one T-2 view, it appears that the disc could be sitting beneath the articular eminence, and on a couple other views it tends to indicate that it may be anteriorly displaced on this side. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces.

Impression:
Left TMJ mild arthritis. Articular disc appears to be in good position although there could be a slight medial displacement
Right TMJ articular disc possible displacement

Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with head and neck that appears extremely long. Disc appears anteriorly displaced more so at the lateral aspect of the joint. There is decreased posterior joint space. The condylar head appears narrow anteroposteriorly in the mid aspect of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ shows similar elongated head and neck of the condyle. Posterior aspect of the condyle appears a little bit flattened and the condyle appears narrow in the mid part the joint as well as over medially. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be in a vertical orientation and anteriorly displaced. There is a decreased posterior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. It also extends posteriorly in the posterior sulcus.

Left coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral head of the condyle comes out even with the lateral rim of the fossa. There appears to be decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint at the lateral rim. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. Difficult to identify discal tissue but in one view it appears that it may be medially displaced. Decreased joint spaces mainly at the lateral aspect of the joint. In the T2 films, the condyle appears much larger but very difficult to identify discal tissue. Open view of left TMJ shows that there is good translation of the condyle. The condylar head appears extremely narrow and again the head and neck appear quite elongated. The condyle comes anterior to the articular eminence. It appears that the disc may be in position.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has relatively normal mediolateral width. There is a significantly decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. Cortex appears to be intact in the fossa and condyle but the bone is extremely thin in the fossa. Cannot see evidence of the disc in this view. Right TMJ T2 images show what appears to be a little bit better size to the condyle as compared what was seen in the T1. Difficult to separate out the discs in these views. In some of these views, condyles appear somewhat large mediolaterally as well as vertically. Right TMJ open view shows likewise good translation of the condyle where it comes anterior to the articular eminence. It appears that the disc is in place and reduces on opening. In the coronal views on opening, also there appears to be good translation forward and it appears that the discal tissues are in place in the open views.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ elongation of the head and neck of the condyles compatible with condylar hyperplasia.
Bilateral TMJ anterior dislocation of the articular disc with reduction on opening.

Dental model analysis shows that the patient still has bilateral posterior crossbites. Dr. XXXX has opened up significant spacing between the upper laterals and cuspids being about 4 mm on the right side and 3 mm on the left side. He was able to jump the occlusion but she is still end-on Class III by almost 5 mm on the right side and 4 mm on the left side. Still very stable occlusion plus the fact that she has significant pain problems and joint pathology. Cephalometric of the upper incisors are over angulated.
