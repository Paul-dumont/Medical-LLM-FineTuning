B297 
Age: 44-year-old female.
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral pole of the condyle is significantly inferiorly positioned compared to the medial pole of the condyle. Articular disc is medially displaced. There is decreased vertical joint space towards the lateral rim of the fossa. Cortical bone in the fossa on the condyle appears to be intact. There is moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa probably about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that may be a little bit smaller than the opposite side. The lateral rim of the fossa appears downward about 2 to 3 mm. Cortical bone appears slightly more fuzzy in some of the views. The joint space appears a little bit decreased compared to the other side. It appears that the disc is likely anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology, but with some flattening on the anterior head and a little bit of sclerosis in that area. Bilaterally, the disc is anteriorly displaced, but at the medial extent of the joint the disc is in better position. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and articular disc and the disc does reduce into position. The disc appears to have good morphology, although the posterior band appears somewhat thickened.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit more arthritic changes. There is sclerosis on the anterior head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Disc is anteriorly positioned and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Medially, the disc is less distinguishable but much more obvious towards the lateral aspect of the joint indicative of perhaps lateral displacement. There is some fluid in the superior joint space and a little bit in the inferior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc and the disc does reduce very early on. The disc in the wide open view appears to have fairly good morphology.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation anteriorly and medially with early reduction.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and possibly laterally displaced, but with reduction on opening.
Both discs are salvageable and probably amenable to repositioning with Mitek anchors.

B297 
B297 is 44 years old, referred by Dr. __
B297 has had previous viral meningitis. She had a herniated disc at L5-S1 and is currently being treated with epidural steroid injections. Previous surgeries include an abdominal hysterectomy 4 years ago. B297 is in good health.

MEDICATIONS
Mobic 15 mg daily for her back. Estratest 1 daily for hormone replacement. With the hysterectomy they did remove her ovaries. B297 gets some earaches and has tinnitus in the left ear, but she relates this to when she shot a deer with a gun close to a truck and reverberation of the noise caused some ear damage. She has some slight residual loss of hearing on the left side. She is not aware of having any problems with vertigo. The other joints that bother her include her neck, back, left shoulder, left thumb and left knee. She wore a collar for her neck for about 6 months in the past. She does have a herniated disc in her back that she is being treated for. She feels her left thumb problems are related to some stretched out ligaments and it may be due to occupation as she does carry a bag where she has to extend her thumb to hold it. Her left knee makes noises and she has had a previous arthroscopy on it at about the age of 22. She was able to ski for 10 years after that and apparently is doing fairly well except for the noises. B297 states that she cannot hyperextend her neck and has never been able to do that ever since she was a youngster. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at night and she does clench some during the day as well. She gets headaches now about once every 2 weeks that occur in the temporal and posterior head area at about a level of about 8 to 9. She used to get her headaches 2 to 3 times a week before she got her splint this past fall and began orthodontics. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 2, jaw function at 5, diet at 4, disability at 3. B297 does have a twin sister who does not have any jaw or joint problems. B297's TMJ problems began probably back in her teenage years and have been present she says as long as she can remember. The etiology is unknown. About 10 years ago, she did wear a splint for awhile. She then was placed back into the splint by Dr. __ last year and she went until last year when she received her orthodontic appliances. B297 also has gone to a chiropractor for treatment and she feels this may have helped her some as well. She had the chiropractic treatment for about 6 months.

In frontal view, B297 has very good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2. Maxillary midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. Upper dental midline is about 3 mm off to the right side. Lower dental midline and chin are fairly well aligned with each other. In profile view, B297 has very good balance between the upper lips, cheeks and nose. There is a bit of an acute nasolabial angle. Chin is retruded by about 15 mm. Chin-neckline is not well defined. Intraorally, B297 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present.

B297 
There is adequate attached gingiva along the lower anterior teeth; however, her lower central incisor roots are very prominent. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has almost a full Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and closer to a Class I cuspid relationship on the left side. She has a vertical overbite of probably less than half a millimeter. She has an overjet of about 2 to 3 mm. Intraorally, the uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal. Faucial pillars are mildly constricted. When sleeping, B297 believes she probably breathes through her mouth. Intranasally, B297 has some deviation of the nasal septum off towards the right side. Turbinates are sort of moderate in size with what appears to be decreased airway on the right side. The left side appears to have better airway. B297 states she has been told that she does snore some. She has some daytime somnolence. She is not aware of whether or not she has any sleep apnea problems. To palpation, B297 has some mild tenderness over the TMJs and styloid areas but no other pain. On opening, she had very slow opening clicks at about 5 mm on the left side and probably about 25 mm on the right side. On closing, she had a click on the right side about 10 mm and the left side about 5 mm. On opening, she did have some crepitus that occurred in the left joint with sort of a crackling sound that was actually audible. Incisal opening is about 50 mm. She opened about 35 mm without significant discomfort. Excursive movement to the right side about 10 mm and to the left side 12 mm. Slight transverse cant in the occlusal plane with left side being 1 to 2 mm lower than the right side. Intraorally, in centric relation the right molars are out of occlusion. Both uppers and lowers appear to be intruded.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. Difficult to evaluate the condyles, but it looks like there may be some flattening on the anterior heads.

Waters view shows that the bony septum is deviated off towards the right side. Turbinates look as if they are moderate in size and it appears that there is airway around them. She has a mucous retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus. The rest of the sinuses look clear. She has large frontal sinuses with the left one being significantly larger than the right side.

On tomograms, unfortunately B297 did not have her teeth together and it shows that there is an increased joint space and flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Joint space is increased but again due to the fact that she was not in centric relation.

Left TMJ tomogram shows that she was close to being in centric relation on this side. Condyle has some flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Cephalometrically, she has a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship. Occlusal plane looks fairly flat. Lower incisors are tipped out very significantly. Upper teeth appear to be in a little better angulation. Oropharyngeal airway appears fairly adequate with some significant narrowing down near the hyoid bone of probably 5 to 6 mm (normal 11 mm.) At the soft palate level, the airway measurement is about 7 mm and at the base of tongue about 8 mm. B297 

BASIC DIAGNOSES
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
AP mandibular deficiency and significant asymmetry.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Class II occlusion on the right side, Class I on the left. Anterior open bite and right posterior open bite.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Large mass, left maxillary sinus.
Decreased eruption of right maxillary and mandibular first and second molars. Transverse cant in the occlusion with the right side being 2 mm vertically shorter than the left side.
Yaw in mandible begin shifted 3 to 4 mm to the left.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Try to extrude maxillary first and second molars on the right side.
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Try to extrude mandibular right first and second molars. May need to consider using interarch elastics to help in that effort as well as repositioning the brackets.

Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning with ligament repair of Mitek anchors. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to down graft, level it transversely and decrease the accentuated curve of occlusion.
Bilateral ramus osteotomies to advance it in a counterclockwise direction approximately 12 mm. Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to advance the chin approximately 3 to 4 mm. Removal of cyst in the left maxillary sinus.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
