B260 
She is 39 years and 10 months old. She is a patient of Dr. ___. B260 has had at least two to three previous rounds of orthodontics. She has no problems with headaches. She had a serious neck injury in the past that still gives her some problems.

In frontal view, she has fairly good left to right facial symmetry with the mandible just slightly shifted off to the right side 1 to 2 mm at the dental midline as well as the chin. She has very prominent masseteric hyperplasia with maybe a little bit more fullness on the left side than the right side. Upper lip looks relatively normal. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship appears to be about 2 mm. In profile view, she has AP maxillary deficiency of 3 to 4 mm and AP mandibular deficiency although the pogonion is relatively strong compared to the position of the lower lip. She has a dished-in appearance with her lips. Chin-neckline may be just slightly short. Intraorally, she is Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right side and closer to a Class I on the left side. She has anterior deep bite of approximately 6 mm. When she smiles it appears that her maxillary posterior teeth are tipped palatally more so on the left side than the right side. In the lower arch also the teeth appear to be tipped in. She is a chronic clencher and bruxer. She cannot get her teeth to fit together very well in centric relation. She bites and her front teeth hit first and then she has to really squish down to get her posterior teeth together. She finds that if she postures her mandible forward to where she is almost, that she feels better and looks better. She has some lingual tori present.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Brachiocephalic facial morphology.
Low mandibular plane angle.
Low occlusal plane angle.
AP maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Prominent pogonion.
Class II end-on occlusion on the right side.
Class I end-on occlusion on the left side.
Anterior deep bite. Mandibular dental midline and chin shifted to the right side approximately 2 mm. Chronic clenching and bruxism.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Medications.
Consider Klonopin 1 mg q.h.s. to control her severe bruxism.
Consider Botox injections to decrease activity of the masseter muscles bilaterally.

Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Try to expand the trans arch bicuspid and molar transverse dimension. Tip lateral incisors roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to increase the space between the roots. Consider opening about 1 mm of space between the crowns of the lateral incisor and cuspids bilaterally. Align and level mandibular arch. Try to expand bicuspid and molar transverse dimension. Surgery.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies of the posterior aspect of the maxilla superiorly. Advance is approximately 4 mm and increase angulation of the maxillary incisors. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomes to advance the mandible in a clockwise direction.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Continue to control chronic clenching and bruxism utilizing Klonopin and Botox injections.

B260 MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite wide mediolaterally. Joint space appears to be decreased in some views. In other views it looks fairly adequate although it may be slightly decreased towards the medial side. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat. Condyle extends slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Cortical bone appears to be intact in both the fossa and the condyle. Right TMJ conal view shows a condyle that likewise is quite wide mediolaterally. The condyle seems just slightly smaller than the opposite side volume wise but not too much difference. The joint space appears fairly balanced and it appears that there is discal tissue in place. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly in a small amount less than 2 mm. The lateral pole of the condyle extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows that out laterally there is some posterior beaking of the condyle that extends posterior to the posterior band of the articular disc. By the time I get to the medial aspect of the joint, the disc appears to be in reasonably good position although there is flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is fairly steep. There is decreased posterior joint space particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is reduction of the disc and reasonably good translation of the condyle and the articular disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows out laterally there is some extreme flattening at the anterior head of the condyle and a little posterior peaking of the condyle posterior to the posterior band of the disc. As we get to the middle or more medial aspect of the joint, the disc appears to be in better position although it is somewhat in a vertical orientation. Articular eminence is fairly steep. There is flattening on the anterior head towards the medial aspect of the joint. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space right underneath the articular eminence. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc is in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and anterior displaced disc at the most lateral aspect of the joint.
B260 
B260 is 40 years old and is referred by Dr. ___. B260 had a history of headaches as a child and was on medications for quite a few years for her headaches. No real specific etiology was found except she was told that she grew too fast and stretched her blood vessels and muscles and this is what caused her headaches. They did eventually go away when she was about 16. About 12 years ago she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained a whiplash injury. She has had headaches since that time. She has been identified as having a cyst on the spinal cord at the level of C7. Since that time, she has had orthodontics x2, 3 years as a teenager and 2 years in her 20s. She has had bite splints since her teen years so this is over 20 years although they have been mostly worn at night but she does currently wear her bite plate some during the day. She has had previous chiropractic treatment from 19 to 21 years ago.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Klonopin 1 mg 3 times per week. Vitamins. Motrin and Advil for pain. She gets frequent earaches, tinnitus and has vertigo about 2 times per week. The only other major joint problem she has is with her neck. She is allergic to penicillin. She clenches at nighttime and also during the day. She gets daily headaches at a level of 6 throughout the head and neck area. About once a week the headaches will escalate to a 9. She rates her TMJ pain level to about a 7, average daily pain at 5, jaw function 2, diet at 3, disability at 1. In frontal view, B260 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. There is some slight asymmetry in the lower third. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is about 2 to 3 mm off to the right side. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are fairly well aligned with each other. In profile view, she has a C-shaped curve to the upper lip. She probably has about 3 to 4 mm AP maxillary deficiency. Chin may be slightly AP deficient by maybe about 6 mm. Chin-neckline is a little bit short and chin-neck angle is not real well defined. As B260 holds her mandible forward about 5 to 6 mm when the upper lip is filled, it improves her facial balance. Intraorally, B260 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She appears to have good attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a slightly reversed curve of Spee in the upper arch. She has some lingual tori. In centric relation she is about 4 to 5 mm Class II on the right side and probably 2 mm Class II on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 4 mm. A little bit of a tendency to buccal cross bite on the left side by only 1 to 2 mm. She has a transverse cant in occlusion with the left side being about 1.5 mm lower than the right side. Oropharyngeal airways looks healthy and uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars are all normal. Intranasally, the turbinates appear moderately enlarged and the luminal valves are a little bit constricted but the septum is straight and B260 ha no complaints about difficulties breathing through her nose. To palpation, B260 has high moderate to low severe pain over the TMJs, styloid areas and posterior neck and moderate pain over the temporalis, masseters, medial pterygoids, SCMs and shoulders. B260 Page 2

On opening, she has glitch noises in the joints moreso on the right side than the left side. Maximal incisal opening is about 43 mm but only about 33 without significant pain. Excursive movements to the right 7 mm, to left 9 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. All the other teeth are present. Large condyle on the maxillary right first molar. Condyles appear large and a little flattened anteriorly. The sinuses look relatively clear. Maxillary incisor roots might be a little bit foreshortened but not too significant.

Waters view shows that there is deviation of the nasal septum in the bony area. Right turbinate may be significantly enlarged. There may be a bony spur off the septum to the end of the left nasal airway. Sinuses look relatively clear. Frontal sinuses are quite large.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be somewhat posteriorly positioned in the fossa. A little bit of anterior beaking appears to be present. Articular eminences are fairly steep.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that may be a little bit sclerotic on top. The posterior joint space appears decreased and slight decreased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric analysis shows that the maxilla and mandible appear to be somewhat retruded. She has some AP macrogenia. Posterior occlusion appears to be open. She appears to have an end-on Class II occlusal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks good. Occlusal plane appears relatively normal. Posterior vertical height of the mandible particularly the ramus area is somewhat elongated.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction.
AP mandibular hypoplasia and asymmetry with the mandible shifted to the right. AP maxillary deficiency.
Class II end-on occlusion.
Bilateral posterior open bite.
Mandibular dental midline shifted 2 to 3 mm to the right of the maxillary midline.
TMJ pain.
Headaches. Myofascial pain. Macrogenia. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being approximately 1.5 to 2 mm lower than the right side.

B260 
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally a little bit more to give a little more room for interdental osteotomies. Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to rotate the mandible onto the facial midline, advance it and move the posterior aspect superiorly.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it and move the posterior aspect upwards and level transversely. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B260 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing very well having no particular problems or concerns. Occlusion is good. She may be slightly open on the left side. I took out her elastics and put 3 elastics on the right side and just 1 on the left side. Edema is decreasing. I suctioned out and cleaned out her airway. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She seems to be progressing very nicely. I answered all the questions she and her sister-in-law had. She is doing well and is to return to see me in 2 days.

B260 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Complains of pain and discomfort around the nose and upper lip area. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She appears to be doing well. Moderate edema as expected. I answered all the questions that she and her sister-in-law had today. She is progressing well and is to return to see me in 2 days. I did debride out her nose and suctioned.

B260 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. She has had some problems with diarrhea and she had a temperature last night but today she is feeling better. No evidence of infection and all incision lines appear as though they are healing well. No evidence of increased swelling. She did have one episode of vomitting the last 24 hours but it was some bloody stuff, may be drainage from her sinus. She otherwise is doing well. No evidence of a yeast infection. She is going to return home today. I gave her 2 prescriptions:
Zofran 4 mg tablets, dispensing 12 tablets, 1 tablet q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea.
Darvocet-N 100, dispensing 40 tablets, 1 tablet q.3-4h. p.r.n. pain.

She is to keep me informed of her progress.
B260 
Telephone conversation: She has driven down to Houston. She was sick the whole way. She is having problems with nausea and diarrhea. She has been unable to keep the oral medications down. I therefore called in a prescription for:
Phenergan suppositories 12.5 mg, dispensing 10, 1 q.4-6h. p.r.n. nausea.
Lomotil 2.5 mg, 2 tablets q.i.d. p.r.n. diarrhea.

She is to keep me informed of her progress. She states that she thinks she may have gotten food poisoning last night from some soup that she ate and perhaps that is why she feels terrible today. This all seemed to have developed after the soup incident.

B260 
She has not done well for the last several days. She has had extreme diarrhea and has been unable to keep anything on her stomach since Friday morning. She made it home but had to make frequent stops to go to the bathroom. She probably got fairly dehydrated. She went in to see her physician yesterday and he told her she had a sinus infection and he gave her some Cipro antibiotics and told her to see an ENT specialist whom she has an appointment with tomorrow. Although he could identify she was dehydrated he did not give her any fluids or any other treatment. She says said she was so weak yesterday she could not climb the stairs to her bedroom and so she stayed downstairs. Today she has felt much better and has been able to keep some food and fluids down and has a little bit more energy. She may go in to see Dr. tonight to get her nose suctioned.

She says her bite fits together well. Upper cuspids are a little bit low compared to the lateral incisors but with the new archwire that should level off for her. She still has some head problems but this may be due to the dehydration. For the most part she is doing much better today and will keep me informed of her progress.

B260 
Telephone conversation: B260 has some facial swelling on the left side that has not gone away and is tender for her. It leaves a red streak going from her cheek down to her lower jaw. It is possible she could be developing an infection. She says she is really not running a temperature at all. I will call in Levaquin as an antibiotic for her.

She said it took her awhile to get over her GI problem. She thinks she had a reaction to the Keflex antibiotic. She is just now being able to get food down. She will be 3 weeks this Friday since surgery. She will need to keep her splint for at least another week. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

B260 
The patient called and said she has continued to have facial swelling on the left side of her face in her cheek area up around her eye area. She finished the Levaquin antibiotic, a 10-day supply and has no improvement. In fact, she feels that is may be worse today. I elected to place her on Cleocin 150 mg tablets dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet t.i.d. and I called this into her pharmacy.

They tried to email us some x-rays last week but we never received them. She will try to get those to us again. She has not really run a temperature even though she has significant swelling. She says that the left side feels warmer to the touch than the right side. She has to sleep in an upright position because if she lays down to sleep she gets significantly increased swelling. I will wait until I have had a chance to evaluate the x-rays and we will determine where to go from here.

I have had several conversations with her tonight. She continues to have swelling in the right side of her face. I reviewed her x-rays. I cannot see any evidence of sinus infection or localized infection around the area. Her maxillary left first molar crown may be dislodged. Otherwise, the x-rays look like normal postsurgical x-rays. I did call in a prescription of Cleocin 150 mg dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet t.i.d. She is to keep me informed of her progress. If she does not improve, she will need to come here for me to evaluate her.

B260 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing very well. She has increased swelling on the left side compared to the right side but no evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. I believe she is progressing nicely. She is to keep me informed of her progress. Occlusion is coming along well. Her orthodontist, Dr. is very pleased with her progress. She is doing well. She completed her round of Cleocin. She is to return to see me in 3 or 4 months.

B260 
Telephone conversation: The patient says that she is doing very well. No headaches and no TMJ pain. Her occlusion is coming along. The molars are just slightly open. For the most part she is doing well. Dr. is trying to finish up her occlusion. She seems happy with the results. She will keep me informed of her progress. I will fax her directions on jaw exercises.

B260 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. She has a little bit of an open bite on the right side. Fitting together better on the left side but second molars are up on the left side yet. She is hitting prematurely on her lower brackets with the upper anterior teeth. After surgery she did have a little bit of an overjet but now she does not. She said that one of the assistants but a power chain on her and it appears to have tipped her incisors back. Angulation of upper incisors is angled a little bit palatally from what it was postsurgery. She has no headaches and no TMJ pain. Incisal opening is about 30 mm. She has excursive movements about 3 to 4 mm. For the most part she is doing well. She may be clenching at night. She has discomfort on the left side. I believe it is probably related to the fact that her left side teeth fit together and she thinks she is clenching at night. The left masseter muscle appears more prominent than the right masseter. Also she has some tenderness in the left cheek and it could be that she is working that bone plate in the left cheek since the right side is more open. She does not want to take a Klonopin. She says Xanax does help her and I suggested that she get back on that to try and keep her from clenching at night. I suggested that her place coils between the upper laterals and cuspids and flare the upper teeth forward a little bit. This should help the posterior teeth settle in a little bit better. She also needs vertical elastics heavier on the right side as compared to the left side and hopefully this will help things settle for her.

She is concerned about the prominence of her chin. I gave her the options of doing a genioplasty and set the chin backwards or doing a little implant in the labiomental fold to build that out a little bit. This would help decrease that prominence. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

B260 
Telephone conversation with Dr. : I told him that I saw B260 today. I feel that orthodontically she is coming along although she is hitting prematurely on her incisors and lower brackets. She has a slight open bite on the right side in the back. I told him that I feel her discomfort and swelling on the left side is due to clenching with hypertrophy of the masseter muscle on the left side and the soreness in the left cheek I believe is because she is working and over-stressing the bone plate in that area. I suggested that Dr. open up spaces between the upper laterals and cuspids and then bond those teeth. The upper teeth have become more vertical and tracing out her x-rays from October through the end of November shows that the upper teeth have been retracted almost 2 mm and the incisors have come down about 1 mm from there original position. This is what I believe is causing the interference. By flaring the incisors forward and then using vertical elastics heavier on the right side than the left side should help settle her bite in. She will start taking some medicine again to help keep her from clenching so much at night. He will keep me informed if there are any concerns or problems.

B260 
Telephone conversation: She says she is feeling much better since the front teeth were pushed forward. Her back teeth touch together now. The orthodontic changes Dr. made have been very effective. The only concern would be if there was any relapse potential with that spring being removed prematurely. She will check with Dr. on that. She is doing very well and will keep me informed of her progress.

B260 
I talked to B260 this morning and she said that last night she had a fairly significant nosebleed out of the left side of her nose. It made her nauseated and she vomited first. It bled from about 4:00 o'clock in the morning until to about 8:30. She did get in to see an ENT doctor today, and he apparently could identify a course of the bleeding, although it was not bleeding at the time. He also saw a wire in the palatal area. He took a CAT scan and said the sinuses looked clear. B260 told me earlier today that she has increased swelling in the left cheek area and it is somewhat tender. On that side, we did place a small bone graft and she also has bone plates on the left side and either of these could be infected perhaps, but she says it hurts and she is swollen in the left cheek area.

B260 
B260 presents for a 15 month followup. For the most part, she is doing very well. She looks beautiful. Occlusion is great. She has a slight increased fullness in the left masseter muscle secondary to some masseteric hyperplasia. Incisal opening is 35 mm. Excursion movements are 6 mm in each direction, and protrusion is about 5 to 6 mm. Occlusion is very good. To palpation, she has mild tenderness over the left masseter, left medial pterygoid, and left styloid area. She takes no medications. She does get some swelling in the left cheek area over the masseter muscle. I-CAT shows no pathology present except for a small spur on the septum that creates no functional problem for her. Sinuses appear clear. Bone plates appear in place and all screws appear to be tight. She is for the most part progressing very well and to keep me informed of her progress. I suggested she do the following:

Advil 2 tablets 3 to 4 times per day.
If Advil does not work consider a stronger anti-inflammatory medication such as Relafen or Celebrex.
Consider muscle relaxer such as Parafon Forte 3 times a day to see if this would decrease the inflammatory process.
Consider Botox injections in the left masseter muscle to decrease its functionality.

She is to keep me informed of her progress.
B260 
Telephone conversation with Dr.  and also conversation with B260 . Apparently, she has developed some facial swelling on the left side adjacent to her nose. Dr. thought she had tenderness over her masseter and temporalis areas, but B260 feels that her prominent pain and discomfort is more adjacent to the left nose. I had seen her in November and we took an I-CAT at that time and she had a similar complaint, but nothing was found at that time and everything looked good. She does have a cervical problem that might be contributing some to her symptoms, but I do not believe would be causing the swelling that she says she is experiencing on the left side of her face beneath her eye and adjacent to her nose area. I suggested that they get a Panorex and she will also get a photo and send it up to me. I went ahead and called in a prescription for Cleocin 150-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.i.d. to see if this would help her. She is to keep me informed me of her progress and they will e-mail the Panorex and photograph.

B260 
Telephone conversation with her. I got her x-ray and photographs. There does not appear to be any dental etiology for her swelling along the left nasal area. It is likely related to either a loose screw or perhaps biofilm around the plates on the left side. She says she has swelling over the more posterior plate previously, but that sort of went away, but now the swelling is around the plate adjacent to her nose. This is where she is tender. I suggested that we remove the bone plates on the left side and that should eliminate the etiology there. She wants to do this as a day surgery. B260  

Telephone conversation with Dr. . Apparently, she is feeling much better and her pain and swelling has gone away. At this point, she does not feel that she needs to have any surgery done. She will keep me informed of her progress.

B260 
I saw her in __ on my visit with Dr. . She is doing very well. Occlusion is very good. She has had no headaches nor TMJ pain since surgery. She had constant headaches prior to the surgery. Incisal opening is good, although a little bit restricted, and I did not measure it. She is very pleased and happy with the results. She is getting a little buildup of her left masseter muscle. This may be related to clenching, but she does not believe that she clenches. She has had some tenderness up around the left paranasal area, but this has resolved since placing her on antibiotics. We will see how she progresses. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

B260 
Telephone call with B260 . The patient went home directly after the surgery on Wednesday. However, she said that when she woke up that she noticed that there was something wrong with her left eye. The nurses apparently examined it, but did not notice anything. Dr. noted that her eye was a little bit red when he went to see her before her discharge. She went home and her eye gave her more problems. She went to an ophthalmologist who said that she had a corneal abrasion that affected about three-quarters of her cornea. She has had to wear a special contact lens. She went and saw the ophthalmologist today and still about half of the cornea has not healed yet. The ophthalmologist is going to see B260 again tomorrow. B260 says in the jaw area she is doing well, but her eye has really been giving her a lot of pain and problems. She says the pain is less this afternoon, and she is able to stretch out her Lortab medication. She also had a lot of swelling in the left eye and her eye was swollen shut, but she is doing better today. She is to keep me informed of her progress. She said she had a little bit of bleeding out of nose which might be expected from the nasal intubation as well as removal of the plates that could cause a little bit of bleeding intranasally.

B260 
Telephone conversation with B260 . She says she is feeling better today. She worked part of the day. The ophthalmologist changed out her contact lens today. Apparently, there is still a third of the eye that is affected yet and it affects B260 's vision in that eye. She is getting discomfort in the other eye because it is over compensating. She is doing better and the ophthalmologist expects it to heal up completely. She will keep me informed of her progress. She says as far as her face is concerned that she is doing very well from that standpoint. B260 

She is doing much better with her eye. She said that her vision the other day was 20/400, but she went in today for an eye exam and it was found at 20/80. She says that she went to see a cornea specialist who told her that her eye had a chemical burn and not an abrasion. She thinks that perhaps it was the iodine in the preparation. I told her that we use the same preparation on all patients and have never experienced that before. I told her I am still at a loss as to what caused the injury. She will keep me informed of her progress.

B260 
She is doing very well from the surgery and has no more pain and swelling in the face where we removed the bone plates. Her left eye also is significantly improved and she no longer has pain in the eye, but her vision is still affected. She says it may take 6 months yet for her eye to clear and hopefully it will clear for her. She is currently devastated that her 50-year-old brother who was in excellent health died of a heart attack  and this has devastated her whole family. Otherwise, she is doing well from our standpoint.
