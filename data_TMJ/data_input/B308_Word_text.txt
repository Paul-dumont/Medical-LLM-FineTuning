B308 
B308 is 40 years old and referred by Dr. __.
Patient Concerns
B308 's primary concerns are to get his teeth straightened and his crossbite corrected.

Patient History
B308 doesn't have any trouble with headaches, TMJ pain, myofascial pain, earaches, tinnitus, or vertigo. He thinks he probably has some hearing loss because he is a pilot and has flown some loud planes. Other joints that bother him include his left shoulder and ankles. He is not aware of any nocturnal clenching or bruxism. Occasionally he may wake up with his jaw locked where he can't close it very easily. This is infrequent, however. He is unaware of the onset of any joint problems and is unaware of any etiological factors that could contribute to joint problems.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B308 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. A little bit more fullness on the left side as compared to the right side. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary and mandibular dental midlines are fairly close to being on the facial midline. Chin may be just a little bit to the right side a couple of millimeters.

In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is probably about 4 mm posterior to the subnasale. Probably has 6 to 8 mm of AP deficiency in the maxilla. Chin appears retruded, and chin-neckline is extremely short, and chin-neck angle is not defined.

B308 has had previous orthodontics and has had his lower first bicuspids extracted. Some minimal crowding, lower anterior arch. Has adequate attached gingiva. Has his third molars in. In the upper arch, he likewise has had first bicuspids extracted and has the rest of his teeth back through the third molars. Some of a V-shaped curvature to the upper arch. His upper lateral incisors are lingually inclined. Has a slight III cuspid relationship by about 2 mm on the left side and has a crossbite on the left side that includes the central incisors back to the second molars. On the left side, he has a similar situation with a crossbite from the incisors back to about the third molar area. The central incisors are end-on with the lower central incisors. He has a slight Class III cuspid relationship on the right side as well. Oropharynx appears fairly clear. There are some splotchy areas on the posterior pharyngeal wall area that could possibly just be glandular tissue. B308 is not aware of having a sore throat or any problems back there. He says right now his wife and child have a little bit of a problem with a sore throat.

Intranasally, he has fairly good size turbinates particularly on the left side. He has a little septal spur on the left side at the base of the septum. Nasal airway seems to be partially obstructed because of the turbinates.

To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. In opening, he has a click at about 10 mm of opening and 5 m of closing. Maxillary incisal opening is 55 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 10 mm and to the left 11 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex reveals the sinuses are relatively clear, although the left one is a little bit more cloudy than the right one. Turbinates appear fairly large, particularly on the left side. Cause fair constricture of the nasal airway. Missing maxillary and mandibular first bicuspids, but all the rest of the teeth are present and unerupted. Condyles appear relatively normal in size with a little flattening on the anterior aspect particularly on the left side. Articular eminences are moderately steep. No other significant pathology noted.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposteriorly compared to the side of the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Condyle has a hockey stick shape to it. It really is quite narrow anteroposteriorly. Increased anterior joint space. This may be indicative of an anteriorly displaced articular disc.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is extremely narrow anteroposteriorly even more so than the opposite side. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Significantly decreased posterior joint space, although the anterior joint space is relatively large.

Opening tomograms show good translation of the condyles bilaterally. The styloid processes are quite thick and elongated.
Waters view shows that the sinuses are all relatively clear. Turbinates are large, particularly on the left side, and the nasal airway appears to be fairly obstructed.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows retrusion of the maxilla and mandible. Surprisingly, the oropharyngeal airway and nasopharyngeal airway are exceptionally good considering the jaw position. He does have a neck postured forward head position. He has basically an end-on incisor relationship. B308  has a tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of 2.5 mm.

Basic Diagnoses
AP maxillary deficiency
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency
Transverse maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular deficiency
AP microgenia
Class III end-on occlusion
Bilateral posterior crossbites and anterior end-on incisor relationship
Tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of 2.5 mm
Mild crowding, upper and lower anterior arches
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations without reduction on the left side and with reduction on the right side
Missing all four first bicuspids
Hypertrophied turbinates
Partial nasal airway obstruction Recommended Treatment

Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Open about a millimeter of space around each upper lateral incisor to help compensate for the tooth-size discrepancy Align and level mandibular arch.

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Multiple maxillary osteotomies with bone screw stabilization to advance it, expand, and downgraft the posterior aspect to decrease the occlusal plane angle
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise fashion
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies
Consider possible augmentation genioplasty

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion

Date of Reading: 

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. Appears that there may be discal tissue over medially. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with minimal downward curvature. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a little bit more than the opposite side. Decreased vertical joint space. Appears that there may be some discal tissue medially but more difficult to tell on this side. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit narrow anteroposteriorly compared to thewidth of the fossa. Anterior beaking is present with sclerosis in the area of the beaking. Articular eminence is fairly steep and long. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is quite short anteroposteriorly. No particular inflammatory response seen around the joint.

On opening, the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction, although there is fairly good translation of the condyle and of the displaced disc.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposteriorly particularly at the medial side, although out laterally it is much wider. Articular disc is fairly steep and long in length. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Some anterior beaking present particularly toward the medial side. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence. The disc has much better shape on this side as compared to the opposite side. No particular inflammatory process occurring within the joint.

On opening, there is reduction of the disc and good translation of both the condyle and the disc.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Both discs appear salvageable, although the left side is in much worse condition as compared to the right side
