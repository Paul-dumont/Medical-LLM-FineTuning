B379 
B379 is 20 years old and referred by Dr. _. B379  has had clicking and popping in her right jaw joint for quite some time extending back into her teenage years. It was not until last year that the problems became much more significant for her.

PRIMARY CONCERNS: She has no comfortable place to put her bite. She has clicking and popping in her joints particularly on the right side. Jaw feels tired all the time and sore.
Daily headaches and TMJ pain.

Her headaches are usually worse towards the end of the day. B379  does experience a closed lock situation. B379 has had significant ear problems such as earaches, tinnitus and occasional vertigo. She also gets occasional decreased hearing. The patient went to an ear doctor and he told her that her ears were fine and I referred her out to see someone about her jaw. She is aware of clenching and bruxism daytime and nighttime. She gets headaches in the frontal area at about a level of 4. She rates her TMJ pain level at 3, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 5, diet at 2 and disability at 4.

In frontal view, B379 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. The lower third face is asymmetric. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. The nasal tip is off to the right side about 2 mm. Maxillary midline is off to the right about 1 mm. Mandibular dental midline is off to the right about 5 mm and chin is off to the right about 8 to 10 mm. In profile view, she may have some slight AP maxillary deficiency but not too much., probably about 2 to 3 mm. Chin may be AP deficient by maybe 4 to 5 mm. Chin-neckline is a little bit short and chin-neck angle is reasonably well defined. Intraorally, B379 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has accentuated curve of Spee. Some transverse narrowness to the lower arch. There is some mild crowding of maybe a couple mm. She has good attached gingiva. She has an accentuated curve of Wilson on the right side and a slight reverse tendency on the left side. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Some mild crowding in the upper arch. There is some lingual inclination in the incisors particularly the right one. On the right side, she has a slight Class II end-on cuspid relationship by probably about 2 mm and on the left side she tends towards a buccal crossbite and likewise is maybe 1 to 2 mm Class II. She has an overjet of about 2 mm an anterior deep bite of about 4 to 5 mm. There is a transverse cant in the occlusion with the right side being 2 mm higher than the left side. She has a reverse curve of Wilson in the upper left side. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy with normal uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars. Tonsils are moderately enlarged. She has no history of snoring or sleep apnea syndrome. She has some mild daytime somnolence but she attributes that to being a student and working and just having an active life. To palpation she has no tenderness around the had and neck area. She has a little glitch in the right TMJ on opening but the left side seems smooth. No tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 49 mm. Excursive movement to the right is about 5 mm, to the left is 12 mm. When she shifts her mandible to the left about 6 mm she has significantly improved facial asymmetry.

 
When she is in centric relation and goes into occlusion she feels her right cuspid, bicuspid area touch and perhaps the left molar area. B379's facial asymmetry has been getting slowly but progressively worse. Her father also has a similar jaw alignment with elongation of the left side and mandible and maxilla shifted off towards the right side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. The left condylar head and neck are significantly longer than the right side. The right side appears more arthritic. The condyle head and length is quite short.

Waters view shows the bony septum to look relatively straight. The left turbinate appears a little enlarged compared to the right side. The sinuses appear relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows an elongated condylar head and neck. Joint space may be a little bit compromised.
Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit more arthritic. It appears a little bit more broader anteroposteriorly. In one of the views it is postured forward and likely not back in centric relation. Articular eminence is with moderate inclination. Opening view shows good translation of both joints and shows a significant difference between the lengths of the condylar head and necks being about probably close to a 50 mm length difference.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows decreased airway. I think she is probably postured forward and she does not show the amount of overjet that she demonstrates in centric relation. Oropharyngeal space looks adequate. Anterior deep bite and slight Class II skeletal relationship.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Left mandibular osteochondroma, osteoma, or condylar hyperplasia with medial displacement of the articular disc.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteromedially dislocated.
Left maxillary vertical hyperplasia and asymmetry. Left mandibular hyperplasia and mandibular asymmetry. Slight Class II end-on occlusion. Accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch. Slight reverse curve of Spee in the upper arch. Increased curve of Wilson mandibular left side and accentuated curve of Wilson mandibular right side.
Left maxillary decreased curve of Wilson and right side increased curve of Wilson. Maxillary midline shifted 1 mm to the left, mandibular dental midline shifted 5 to 6 mm to the left, and chin shifted 10 mm to the left. Transverse cant in the maxillary occlusion with the left side being 2 mm lower than the right side. Headaches. TMJ pain.  

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Try to expand and upright the left posterior teeth. This may be helped with cross arch elastics. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally in case interdental osteotomies are required. Align and level mandibular arch. Try to upright the right posterior teeth. Cross arch elastics with buttons on the lingual of the lowers may be helpful. Slenderize lower anterior teeth to remove 1 to 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring the lower teeth any further forward.
Surgery.
Left TMJ condylectomy and articular disc repositioning with ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Right TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to shift the mandible back onto the facial midline.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to shift the maxilla back onto the facial midline and establish a good occlusion. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B379  EVALUATION 20/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is exceptionally large. It appears elongated vertically and mediolaterally. It extends slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically. There appears to be some discal tissue there but it is somewhat medially displaced. Decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm.

Right TMJ shows a condyle that is small in size and probably less than half the size of the left condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There appears to be decreased lateral joint space. The discal tissue appears to be displaced medially.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows out laterally there is a significantly decreased joint space. More medially the joint space appears better. The condyle has a little flattening on the top. The disc may be in position or may be slightly anteriorly dislocated. Articular eminence is moderately steep but elongated. On opening there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in a reduced position on opening. The condylar head and neck appear significantly elongated.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. On opening, the articular disc appears to remain anteriorly displaced without reduction. The disc is significantly deformed and short anteroposteriorly. There is a little bit of flattening on the head of the condyle.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ possible condylar hyperplasia versus osteochondroma versus osteoma with what appears to be an anteriorly displaced disc with early reduction. Right TMJ mild arthritic and articular disc anteriorly dislocated without reduction and significant deformation.
