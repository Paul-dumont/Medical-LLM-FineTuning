B390 
B390 was referred by Dr. . Primary concerns he has are sleep apnea and depression. B390 is currently 48 years old. B390 is in good health except for the airway factors. He takes the following medications:

Amitriptyline 50 mg.
Amitriptyline CDP 25-10.
Ativan 1 mg, all these q.h.s.
B390 is currently on a BiPAP device. Since being on it, he has been able to decrease his requiring for Ativan from 4 mg down to less than 1 mg. Primary concerns B390 has include the following:

Insomnia.
Sleep apnea.
He has had previous surgeries that included the following:
Removal of the uvula.
Tonsillectomy.
Reduction of the turbinates. Septum reconstruction. Tongue ablation.
Soft palate procedures.

None of his procedures he has had so far have helped with his airway situation.
B390 does have some clicking in his TMJs. He says it used to be worse than it currently is. His joint problems began when he was about 40 of unknown etiology. He gets headaches usually around a level of 2 in the temporal and posterior head areas, but his headaches can escalate up to 8 or 9. Most days he does not have any significant headache factors. He rates his TMJ pain at 2, daily pain at 2, jaw function at 1, diet and disability at 0. His TMJ problems began at about the age of 40 of unknown etiology and he has had no treatment specifically for the TMJ issues. He has no earaches but has continuous tinnitus and occasional vertigo. He is aware of clenching his teeth at nighttime.

In frontal view, B390 has some increased fullness in right mandibular angle by probably 3 to 4 mm. It appears that it may be predominantly in the masseter muscle area. Upper lip length is about 27 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about -3 mm. The maxillary midline is about 1 mm off to the left side. The mandibular dental midline is about 3 mm off to the left side. The chin is about 2 or 3 mm off to the left side. In profile view, chin neckline is short and chin neck angle is not well defined. He has a head postured forward neck position. Upper lip appears somewhat elongated and the lower third face appears somewhat compared to upper lip length. Intraorally, B390 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molar on the left side and third molar on the right side and is missing the mandibular left second bicuspid and perhaps the left second bicuspid. He has huge mandibular tori labially and lingually. Linguals come within probably about 8 mm of touching. In the upper arch, he has some fullness of his alveolus particularly on the right side where it extends lingually a little bit, again probably due to some increased bone thickness in that area. On the soft palate, he has had previous UPPP procedure and has a moderate curtain kind of effect present. B390 does have a posterior yaw with the maxilla and mandible being rotated off to the right side at least a couple of millimeters. He has lower arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being 3 to 4 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, the left cuspid is 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. Transversely, the arches are fairly level. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size. The septum is deviated a little bit off towards the right side anteriorly. B390 has severe snoring, moderate daytime somnolence, and severe sleep apnea problems. He also has a severe sleep disorder. He, however, feels he is predominantly a mouth breather. He does have a head postured forward neck position and he is on a BiPAP machine. He says that sleep studies show that he stops breathing up to 60 seconds at 23 times per hour.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the mandibular left third molars, but the right third molars are in place. On the left side, he has an ankylosed submerged primary second molar in the second bicuspid area with no successor.

Coronal view shows that he has what appears to be some significant hypertrophy of the turbinates more posteriorly than anteriorly. Sinuses look relatively clear except for some increased thickness of the sinus membrane on the floor of the right maxillary sinus.

Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear in this view and the septum is reasonably straight. The turbinates are of moderate size and seem to create more obstruction more posteriorly than at the anterior aspect.

Left TMJ sagittal views show a condyle that has a little bit of peaking on it and the fossa has an unusual shape with significant peaking in the depth of the fossa. There is a little bit of anterior beaking tendency and a little flattening on the posterior head. The fossa has an unusual shape and is more tent shaped than it is in the usual curved confirmation.

The right condyle also has some flattening and some slight anterior beaking tendency. It also has an odd shaped fossa with a tenting also present. The joint space otherwise looks reasonable in both joints.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There appears to be reasonably joint space.
Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have reasonably good shape to it and reasonable joint space.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the maxilla and mandible appear to be retruded. He has an airway space between soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall of 5 mm and at the base of the tongue that is about 3 mm. The airway appears quite constricted at the base of the tongue. The base of the tongue, however, sits off the palate by about 5 to 6 mm. He does have an end-on incisor relationship.

On opening and closing, he has got multiple noises that occur in the right TMJ and also a little bit on the left side. Not the typical sound one would expect to hear with the disc being out of position. He has no pain to palpation around the head and neck area. If B390 puts pressure on the anterior band of the masseter muscle from an external direction, within a relatively short time it creates excruciating pain for him. There is a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B390 would be as follows:
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia. Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Severe sleep apnea. Class III end-on occlusion on the right side and Class II end-on occlusion on the left side. Mandibular left cuspid 3 to 4 mm posterior to the right cuspid. Maxillary left cuspid 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. Mandibular dental midline and chin shifted 3 mm to the left. Severely submerged anklyosed mandibular left second primary molar.
High occlusal plane angle.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's dfference of 3 mm. Posterior yaw with the maxilla and mandible shifted about 2 to 3 mm to the right.
Right masseter muscle hyperplasia. Rule out TMJ pathology.
Malaligned right side third molars x2. Large lingual and buccal mandibular tori.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	MRI of left and right TMJ.
2.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Open up 1 mm of space between the upper lateral incisors and cuspids. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2 mm of tooth structure. Push the left cuspid and first bicuspid forward 2 mm. We may need to tie onto the anklyosed mandibular primary second molar for stability and to keep from distalizing the molars on the left side.
3.	Surgery. a.	Maxillary osteotomies to advance it a bout 2 mm at the incisal edge in a counterclockwise direction with correction of the posterior yaw. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction with pogonion coming forward approximately 15 mm. c.	Removal of malaligned right maxillary and mandibular third molars. d.	Removal of lingual and buccal mandibular tori.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5.	Removal of anklyosed mandibular left second primary molar with placement of osteointegrated implant and crown.

DATE OF ACQUISITION: DATE OF INTERPRETATION:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is good mediolateral width. There appears to be discal tissue in position within the joint. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just about 2 mm. Cortical bone on the fossa is quite thin. There may be just some slight lateral displacement of the discs, but not too significant.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There appears to be discal tissue in position over top of the condyle. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some flattening on the anterior head. The articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be in position particularly at the medial side. It could be just slightly anteriorly displaced at the most lateral aspect of the joint. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. There is an odd shape to the fossa with the posterior band of the disc positioned up into the depth of the fossa.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little flattening and a little sclerosis and a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is moderately steep, however, the articular disc appears to be in position. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both joints. The discs remain in position.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritic changes with articular discs slightly displaced with fluid in the joint spaces.
