B533
B533 is 16 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B533 has had her wisdom teeth removed. She has had an adenoidectomy and a turbinate reduction. She has had previous orthodontics by Dr. XXXX.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Open bite.
Difficulties breathing through her nose.
Predominately a mouth breather. Difficulty getting her lips together when she eats.
Snoring when she sleeps.

Review of B533's previous orthodontics records show that at the age of 13 that she had a little bit of tendency towards an open bite although she had a vertical overlap of about 2 mm almost in the incisors. Probably slightly a Class II in the jaw and occlusal relationship. He was retruded in the mandible and had a little bit of vertical excess at that time. Viewing records dated 1one week ago shows that she has a significant open bite at this time of probably 3 to 4 mm, a Class II occlusion, high occlusal plane angle and a more retruded mandible. In addition, it shows that on previous x-rays that she still has enlarged turbinates particularly on the right side. She has a mass in the posterior aspect of the palate that could be either in the sinus or in the nasal cavity. It is located at the posterior aspect of the palate extending just beyond the posterior border of the hard palate. By history she has been scoped several times and no one has seen this mass so it is possible it could be perhaps in a sinus. It possibly could be the posterior aspect of the turbinates because the turbinectomies that were done were just apparently partial turbinectomies and may have not extended all the way to the posterior aspect of the nose.

In frontal view, B533 has good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Some slight asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length with a little bit of support is about 18 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 6 mm on the left and 7 mm on the right. Maxillary dental midline is about 1 mm to the left and mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm to the left and chin is about 4 to 5 mm to the left. She has lip incompetence of about 9 mm. Upper lip is about 4 mm AP retruded. She has a C-shaped curve to the upper lip. Chin is AP retruded by approximately 20+ mm. Chin-neckline is short. She has a head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, B533 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower anterior arch. She has fairly good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, B533 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has significantly accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch with particularly the second molars being elevated higher than the rest of the teeth. It is likely because she occludes predominately on her first and second molars on the left side and maybe just her second molars on the right side. She has a Class II end-on occlusal relationship and an anterior open bite of about 3 to 4 mm. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being about 2 mm lower than the left side. Her open bite is a little bit greater on the right side as compared to the left side. She has AP asymmetry in both arches with the maxillary left cuspid being about 1.5 mm posterior to the right cuspid, mandibular left cuspid about 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid.

The uvula is mildly elongated, as is the soft palate. Faucial pillars are moderately constricted particularly the posterior faucial pillars. Tonsils do not appear relatively unremarkable. Intranasally there is deviation of the anterior septum off towards the left side quite considerable probably by at least 3 mm or so. The turbinates are hyperplastic particularly on the right side. The left side turbinate appears enlarged but is somewhat blocked making it difficult to evaluate it because of the deviation of the nasal septum. Columella, nostrils and luminal valves all appear normal. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, she has significant crepitation in the left joint and some on the right side as well. Maximal incisal opening is 55 mm. Excursive movement is 8 mm to the right and 9 mm to the left.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the left sinus appears a little bit cloudy compared to the right side. Turbinates appear enlarged. Third molars are gone from previous surgical removal last summer. There is a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch. Significant space between the upper lateral incisors and cuspid roots. Marked arthritis in both TMJs with the left side being worse than the right side. There appears to be significant loss of condylar volume including even the condylar neck on the left side as compared to the right side.

Left TMJ tomogram shows significantly decreased vertical joint space and a small condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep.
Right TMJ shows significant arthritic changes. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be decreased joint space though the posterior joint space appears relatively normal. On opening, there is adequate translation of both joints with there actually being a little bit more translation of the right joint as compared to the left joint.

Waters view shows the bony septum is reasonably straight but turbinates appear large and there appears to be very minimal function of the nasal airway.

Lateral cephalometric radiographic shows that B533 has a high occlusal plane angle and an anterior open bite with a Class II skeletal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about less then 3 mm at the base of the tongue and at the soft palate level. There appears to be some kind of a mass situated in the area of the posterior choanae, possible a polyp, a calcified area of the posterior turbinates versus mass inside one of the sinuses. She has an anterior vertical maxillary excess and significant lip incompetence. Tooth size analysis reveals a Bolton's difference of about 1 mm. The maxillary left central incisor is actually about 1 mm smaller than the right central incisor.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption, left side worse than the right side.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
AP mandibular deficiency.

Apertognathia.
Class II end-on occlusion. Occluding only on the second molar.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Deviated nasal septum. Large lesion (2 cm x 2 cm) in nasopharynx. Severe nasal airway obstruction. Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 mm (normal 11 mm.) Masticatory dysfunction. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 2 mm lower than the left side. Transverse facial asymmetry with the dental midlines being shifted to the left 1 mm and chin being shifted about 4 to 5 mm to the left. Asymmetry in the upper arches with the left cuspid being 1.5 to 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally. Place brackets on the second molars but do not engage them in the archwire. Place a step in the maxillary archwire between the lateral incisors and cuspids to help extrude the cuspids 1 to 2 mm and align the 4 incisors and elevated occlusal plane.
Align and level mandibular arch. Place brackets on second molars but do not engage them in the archwire.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly approximately 6 mm, advance it and decrease the occlusal plane.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomy to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Bilateral partial turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty. Remove lesion from nasal pharynx.
Genioplasty.
Post-surgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B533 MRI
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears small in size mediolaterally and perhaps a half or third of normal size. Decreased joint space towards the lateral aspect. It appears there may be some discal tissue over medially. There also appears to be discal tissue anterior. There appears to be significant loss of condylar volume.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is also small in size but not to a degree of the left joint. Decreased joint space vertically. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There appears to be discal tissue anteriorly and perhaps with some lateral displacement. The patient has lost significant condylar volume but not as significant as the opposite side.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost significant volume. There is significant anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately shallows. Increased joint space vertically and posteriorly. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. It appears there is some fluid in the superior joint space and a moderate amount in the inferior joint space. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle and articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost some volume but not as severe as the opposite side. There is decreased superior joint space towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint the posterior band is quite thickened. The disc also appears to be laterally displaced. The disc is deformed similar to the opposite side. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle and articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ resorptive arthritis compatible with ICR and articular disc dislocated without reduction. Right TMJ resorptive arthritis (compatible with ICR) and articular disc dislocated anteriorly and laterally without reduction.
