B040
B040 is in good health. She is referred by Dr. XXXX. She has no major medical problems. She takes no medications. B040 has had previous orthodontic treatment from about the age of 10 to 14. She had orthodontic appliances. She had a palatal expander and more recently she had a Herbst appliance on her jaws. Dr. XXXX performed the initial treatment. B040's problems may have begun back when she was about six years old. She was putting a mouthpiece from scuba equipment in her mouth and it was too big and since that time she has had some problems. It became more of an issue when she was about 10 years old with clicking and popping and discomfort. She then received the orthodontic treatment by Dr. XXXX. She does have some scoliosis and she has flat feet. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She has occasional earaches with some tinnitus and moderate occurrences of vertigo. She gets headaches about a level of 4 in the frontotemporal area. She rates her TMJ pain at 5 and average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 6, diet and disability at 4.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Retruded lower jaw.
Discomfort on opening and closing.
Popping sounds in the joint.
Pain.
Bite is off.
B040 does have difficulty breathing through her nose. She predominately breathes through her mouth. She is not aware of snoring. She has some mild daytime tiredness but she is not aware o any sleep apnea issues. She tends to sleep on her stomach. When she lays her back it is difficult for her to breathe.

In frontal view, B040 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third face. The upper lip is about 23 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 to 3 mm. Maxillary and mandibular dental midline is pretty much aligned with each other. Chin is a little bit off to the right side about 2 to 3 mm. She has some mild AP deficiency in the upper lip about 3 mm. Chin may be retruded as much as 20 mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. B040 has a head postured forward neck position. She tends to hold her head with a significant upwards orientation. Intraorally, B040 has intermixed dentition with some retained primary Es. The first and second molars are in place. The lower teeth are fairly well aligned. She has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch she likewise has intermixed dentition. Her upper cuspids are not erupted in yet. She has retained E in the maxillary right side. On the left side the second bicuspid is starting to erupt in. She has Class II end-on occlusal relationship about 2 to 3 mm. She appears to have an overjet of about 2 mm. She has about ½ mm overbite relationship. When she goes into occlusion she occludes only on the first molars and the primary Es on the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues look reasonably healthy. I had difficulty seeing them because she has a gag reflex and just does not like the throat being examined. As best as I can see the uvula looks relatively normal. The soft palate may be mild to moderately elongated. The faucial pillars may be mild to moderately constricted. Tonsils are mild to moderate in size. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderate size. The septum is fairly straight. B040 Page 2

There may be some mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction. There is a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 1 to 2 mm higher than the left side. It is difficult to assess, however, since the cuspids are not erupted in, in the upper arch. To palpation, she has moderate to very high moderate pain throughout the head and neck area. She has a little bit of a glitch in opening in the right TMJ but the left one seems to function relatively smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is 33 mm. Excursive movement to the left is 6 mm and to the right 5 mm. Her opening without significant pain and discomfort is 20 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of mandibular third molars but presence of maxillary impacted third molars. She has retained primary Es bilaterally without successors. In the upper arch she has a retained primary E on the right side but permanent successor is above although somewhat malaligned. Cuspids are not fully erupted yet although they appear to be getting close. The sinuses look relatively clear. The condyles appear short in vertical height.

Waters view shows that sinuses are clear. The septum is reasonably straight with just some slight deviation in the bony aspect. Turbinates are moderate in size. She has a ponytail on and the holder device can be seen overlying the right orbital area.

Right TMJ tomogram shows what appears to be loss of vertical height of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately flat. Difficult to evaluate the joint space in this view, as the cuts do not appear to be deep enough.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have lost some volume particularly vertically. Joint space appears somewhat decreased. Articular eminence appears elongated with moderate inclination. On opening, there is some restriction in translation of both joints.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B040 has a high occlusal plane angle. She has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship. Suprisingly the oropharyngeal airway looks fairly good with an AP dimension of about 8 to 9 mm at the soft palate and base of the tongue area. Incisors of both arches appear to be in fairly good alignment over the base of bone structures. B040 does have some lip incompetence. The inferior borders of the occlusal plane are fairly well superimposed. The condyles and condylar necks appear short in vertical height. The mandible may appear somewhat elongated.

I am unable to do a tooth size analysis because upper cuspids are not erupted in. Upper lateral incisors, however, appear small compared to the lower lateral incisors indicative of probably at least a 2 to 3 mm tooth size discrepancy.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ adolescent internal condylar resorption (AICR).
AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
B040 Page 3

AP mandibular deficiency.
AP microgenia. Class II end-on occlusion. Steep occlusal plane angle.
Impacted maxillary third molars x2.
Retained bilateral mandibular Es with no successors. Retained maxillary right E. Unerupted cuspids and second bicuspids in the upper arch. Occludes only on the right Es and first molars. Hypertrophied turbinates. Partial nasal airway obstruction. Headaches. TMJ pain. Myofascial pain.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Surgery stage 1.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Open 1 mm of space between the upper laterals and cuspids. Keep lateral incisor roots tips mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Consider slenderizing the lower arch maybe 1 to 2 mm to help correct for the tooth size discrepancy.
Surgery stage 2.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to down graft the posterior aspect and advance the maxilla slightly and upright the incisors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Augmentation genioplasty.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
Surgical removal of impacted maxillary third molars x2.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B040 MRI EVALUATION AGE: 14/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost some vertical height. There may be some discal tissue. Joint space appears somewhat decreased particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. It appears there is discal tissue anteriorly positioned.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears smaller in size than the opposite. There appears to be loss of vertical height as well as mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa in both joints appear inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. Decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some arthritic changes. Some anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is quite steep and quite elongated particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is best seen towards the lateral aspect of the joint and more poorly seen towards the medial side. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. The disc is short in anteroposterior dimension and somewhat thickened.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit more arthritic. There may be some loss of vertical volume. Articular eminence is moderately steep and not as elongated as the opposite side at the lateral aspect. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Posterior joint space is decreased. The condyle does appear arthritic. There appears to be some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction with significant degenerative changes. Articular eminence is excessively steep particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated without reduction. Discs may still be salvageable.
