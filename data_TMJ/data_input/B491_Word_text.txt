B491 
B491 is 14 years old. She was referred by Dr. XX. Last year, B491 was involved in a 4-wheeler accident. She does not remember much about the accident. It is not known if the vehicle landed on her or whether she hit the ground, but she sustained a left subcondylar fracture of the mandible. She was treated a closed reduction and her teeth wired together for 2 weeks by Dr. XX. She wore elastics for an additional 4 months. Occlusion apparently was reasonably well controlled at that time. After the elastics and braces were removed, then she started to develop a more noticeable asymmetry. She began to occlude predominantly on left side and the right side teeth came apart. Basically, they have seen Dr. XX and Dr. XX. Dr. Warner is the one that ordered an MRI on B491. They also have consulted Dr. X. In addition, they had reconsulted with Dr. XX as well.

Prior to her injury, B491 had orthodontics in the third grade and seventh grade by Dr. XX. She had some orthodontics following the accident beginning last year by Dr. XX. Subsequently, she saw Dr. XX who made a splint for B491 . Also, he put her into acupressure treatment and gave her supplements such as fish oil, folic acid, and cilantro. B491 continues to have significant pain problems.

B491 rates her headaches at 0, TMJ pain bilaterally at 6 but it can escalate to 9. Her average daily pain follows the TMJ pain at a level of 6 on the average but can escalate to 9. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 2, disability at 3, but relative to playing sports she rates her disability at 8. She has no earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss and no other joints bother her. She does not believe that she clenches and grinds her teeth at night. Currently, B491 pain gets worse in about mid afternoon. The pain seems to escalate after she eats.

She current takes the following medications:
Aleve 2 tablets 2 times per day.
Zanaflex 1 tablet q.h.s. to help her sleep at night.
She does take some medications for her complexion including:

Spironolactone.
Doxycycline.
Topical mask wash.
Primary concerns that B491 has at this time include the following:
Pain.
Swelling predominantly in the left masseter muscle area.
Pain and swelling increases with exercise.
Pain is becoming increasingly constant.
Jaw asymmetry.
Deviation of the jaw on opening.

B491 does not report any airway problems, but does have difficulty sleeping at night because of her pain issues. In frontal view, B491 has some increased facial fullness on the left hand side likely related to some masseteric hypoplasia on that side. She likely has about 3 to 4 mm of increased fullness on the left side compared to the right side. In clenching, there is more bulk in the left masseter muscle as compared to the right side. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 2 mm. In profile, she has good facial balance. There may be just some slight AP deficiency but not significant. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. In the upper arch, she also has all of the teeth back through the second molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. Midlines are fairly well aligned. She has about a 2 mm vertical overbite. The maxillary and mandibular dental midlines are pretty much on the facial midline. Chin may be just a touch to the left but not too significant. As she opens, the mandible deviates about 8 to 9 mm to the left. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. Tonsils are moderately enlarged. B491 may be a mouth breather at night, but she is not real sure. She is not sure if she clenches at night, although she says her jaws are always achy and sore even when she wakes up in the morning, although her pain continues to get worse in the afternoon after lunch. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged. To palpation, she has high moderate pain over the right TMJ, moderate pain over the masseters which is greater on the left side than the right, and in the right retromandibular area. Left retromandibular area had high moderate low severe pain levels. She gets pain more so in the right joint when she opens wide. Both joints seem to function smoothly. The maximal incisal opening is 42 mm, opening without pain 18 mm. The excursion movement to the right is 3 mm and to the left 8 mm. There is a slight transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being about 1.5 mm higher than the right side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of four impacted third molars. The sinuses look reasonably clear and turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The right condyle appears relatively normal in architecture. The left condyle demonstrates pathology present and the previous subcondylar fracture.

Coronal x-ray shows that the sinuses are clear. The septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. The turbinates are hyperplastic particularly on the right side with significant decreased functional airway.

Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The turbinates are enlarged particularly on the right side.
Left TMJ coronal view shows evidence of a previous subcondylar fracture. The condyle is almost at a 90 degree angle to the ramus. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat with virtually no downward curvature. The condyle and condylar neck area appear to be functioning anterior in the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. The joint space appears reasonably good, although it could be slightly narrow at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows evidence of a subcondylar fracture. The head of the condyle is displaced far medially. The residual condylar neck is functioning anteriorly along the inferior slope of the articular eminence.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle and fossa that has fairly good architecture and good joint space.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is a slight vertical discrepancy in the occlusal plane with about a 2 mm vertical difference and at the inferior border about a 4 mm vertical difference. Oropharyngeal airway may be just slightly compromised.

Basic diagnoses for B491 would be as follows:
Left mandibular nonunion of subcondylar fracture.
Left mandibular hypoplasia.
Bilateral TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain. Hitting prematurely with the left occlusion.
Moderate left masseteric hyperplasia.

Recommended treatment options:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics: Placement of maxillary and mandibular orthodontic appliances.
2.	Surgery. a.	Left TMJ arthroplasty and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. b.	Left mandibular sagittal split osteotomy.
3.	Postsurgical orthodontics to finish and retain the teeth.

Treatment option 2:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics: Place orthodontic appliances on the maxillary and mandibular teeth.
2.	CT scan of jaws and jaw joints.
3.	Surgery. a.	Left TMJ reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Left TMJ fat graft (harvest from the abdomen).
3.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Since she has significant difficulties at night due to pain and she has pain during the day and it significantly impedes in her life, I elected to give her two prescriptions:

Relafen 750 mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, one tablet q.d., refill x5.
Tramadol 50 mg tablets, dispensing 40 tablets, one tablet q.6 hours pain.
The family is to contact me in 1 to 2 weeks to let me know how she is doing well on the pain medication.

DATE OF INTERPRETATION:	 
Left TMJ coronal view shows that the condyle is medially displaced from previous subcondylar fracture. It is almost at a 90 degree angulation. Difficult to identify where the articular disc is in this view. There is tissue in the joint space from the level of almost the sigmoid notch up to the fossa area.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The disc may be medially displaced.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows that the articular disc appears to be in reasonable position almost beneath the articular eminence. The functional part of the joint is beneath the disc. There is fluid in the joint space. The head of the condyle is positioned medial. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The residual condyle is functioning low towards the apex of the articular eminence. The disc appears to have fairly good morphology. The condylar head is displaced anteromedially. On opening, there is restricted translation.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that the disc appears to be in position. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There is a little bit of anterior beaking on the condyle. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the disc in position.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ previous subcondylar fracture with the condyle being displaced anteromedially. The articular disc appears to be in a reasonable position relative to the fossa but not the condyle. Right TMJ appears to be relatively normal.
