B455
B455 is 58 years old. He sustained a stroke 8 months ago. Since that time he has not been able to open his jaws. He was put asleep sometime before 4 months ago for some eye surgery and at that time they were unable to open his jaws.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Colace 100 mg b.i.d.
Zocor 20 mg q.h.s.
Zoloft 50 mg q.h.s.
Erythromycin ointment for his eyes.
Clinically, B455 has suffered a stroke and has paralysis on the right side of his face. Facial balance is consistent with unilateral paralysis. He has basically a Class II cuspid relationship on the left side and closer to a Class I on the right side. When he bites together and then opens a little, his mandible shifts towards the right side. He can shift towards the right side probably about 5 mm. He has difficulties shifting his lower jaw to the left side. Intraorally, he is missing the left first and third molars, the right second bicuspid first molar with the second and third molar drifted forward. He appears to also be missing the maxillary left second bicuspid third molar and maxillary right second bicuspid second and third molar. He has some significant periodontal problems around the molars. Sinuses look clear. Jaw joints look okay with a little bit more difference seen in the right TMJ area. Waters view shows that he has a weight in the right eyelid. Turbinates appear a little bit enlarged. Septum appears a little bit deviated. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Right TMJ tomograms are a little hard to read but there appears to be joint space and difficult to tell if there is any bony fusion.
Left TMJ tomogram likewise is a little bit difficult to interpret but there does appear to be good joint space with relatively normal inclination of the articular eminence. On opening, there is restricted translation in the left joint although there may be some movement whereas on the right side there is very minimal translation abilities.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has basically just a slight Class II skeletal relationship but he appears to have adequate oropharyngeal airway.

Maximal incisal opening is about 7 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 6, left is 0. Even with trying to get B455 to relax, I was unable to shift the mandible towards the left at all. He has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, he has extreme prominence and what appears to be restriction of the right masseter muscle. Interestingly, as he shifts his jaw from side-to-side, I could feel mobility and movement in both TMJ joints which would rule that out as far as being a causative factor in my determination. On opening, there is a very dense tight band of tissue running through the right masseter muscle. With the same movements in attempts to open, the left masseter remains soft and pliable. I cannot see any evidence of increased calcification around the right masseter muscle area. With gentle hand manipulation I was able to open the patient to 17 mm. 

DIAGNOSES: Right masseter muscle with severe trismus.
Severely limited jaw function.
Post CVA.
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications.
Klonopin 1 mg tablets 1 tablet q.h.s. ½ tablet b.i.d., dispense 60 tablets, refill x3.
Jaw exercises 5 times a day for about 10 to 15 minutes at each time.
Consider botox injections to help decrease muscle spasms. Consider surgery as a last resort for resection of the masseter muscle with placement of fat graft in defect area.

B455  MRI Evaluation
Age: 58/M
DOB: 
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has relatively normal size. There appears to be a significantly decreased joint space vertically, but in one view it appears that there could be some discal tissue there although extremely thin. The cortical bone in the fossa is a little harder to see in one view. It could be that there is significantly decreased joint space through a good portion of the joint. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good width. There appears to be some medullary bone just above the roof of the fossa. Significantly decreased joint space appears to be present.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a fairly good shape to it. Articular eminence has relatively normal architecture to it. Articular disc appears for the most part to be in position. There appears to be adequate joint space surrounding the head of the condyle although perhaps slightly decreased posteriorly towards the medial aspect of the joint. Perhaps a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but no significant inflammatory process noted. Some slight abnormal architecture on the head around the posterior aspect but not too significant.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking present. The fossa is relatively normal in size and shape. Articular disc appears to be in position. There may be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. A little bit of increased tissue perhaps surrounding the disc a little more so than the opposite side. The disc appears a little bit thicker on the right side as compared to the left side.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis but the disc appears to be in position.
