B157
B157 is 14 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B157 began orthodontics 12 months ago. She had a palatal expander and a lip bumper from ags 8 to 9. She has no TMJ pain, no headaches, no myofascial pain. She rates her TMJ function, diet, and disability at zero. She has no problems with headaches. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the medial period, temporalis muscles, and shoulder muscles. She has noticeable clicking on closing of the right joint and clicking on wide opening and excursion in the left joint. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo, and apparently no other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. Incisal opening is 60 mm. Excursion movements are 9 mm in each direction.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, she has a significant lip incompetence of 8 mm. Upper lip length is 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 8 mm. Maxillary midline is shifted 1 mm to the right, mandibular dental midline 1 mm to the left and chin 3-4 mm to the right. The left side of the mandible is 4 mm longer vertically at the angle area and 2 mm longer vertically at the body area. The right mandible is about 2 mm more prominent at the angle area transversely compared to the left side. She has a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 2 mm lower than the right side. When she smiles, she shows a significant amount of gingiva. She has some hyperplastic gingival that covers part of her crowns. In profile view, she is deficient in the maxilla by about 3 mm and intruded in the mandible by 15-18 mm. Chin neckline is short and she has a head postured forward neck position. On occlusion, she has an anterior deep bite of 5-6 mm. She has a Class II cuspid relationship. She has significant spaces between the upper laterals and cuspids. She does have spaces in the second bicuspid area in the upper arch and in the mandibular left lower arch. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal. She has a moderately enlarged right nasal turbinate. She has mild snoring but no other sleep apnea issues. She is a mouth breather at night time and also during the day time.

MRI demonstrates that she has bilateral TMJ displaced articular discs.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and the absence of the maxillary second bicuspids and mandibular left second bicuspids. Condyles appear a little bit arthritic.

Coronal view shows that the septum is reasonably straight in the bony area, but inferior turbinates are moderately enlarged.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear and the inferior turbinates are moderately enlarged. Septum is reasonably straight. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit narrow mediolaterally. There is decreased joint space. It does appears the lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3-4 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit narrow in transverse width and there is decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 4 mm. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. Joint space is a little bit decreased vertically and posteriorly. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have some anterior beaking. The superior cortical bone appears a little thin and there may have been some resorption in this joint as well as the other one. The articular eminence has a slightly shallow orientation. The joint space may be slightly decreased. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has AP mandibular deficiency and perhaps some slight AP maxillary deficiency, although she has anterior vertical maxillary excess and over angulation of the maxillary incisors. Occlusal plane level is relatively normal. The oropharyngeal airway however is 4 mm at the soft palate level and 5-6 mm at the base of the tongue.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
1.	Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs dislocated.
2.	Mandibular AP hyperplasia.
3.	Maxillary vertical hyperplasia and slight AP hypoplasia.
4.	Hypertrophied turbinates.
5.	Class II occlusion.
6.	Anterior deep bite of 5-6 mm.
7.	Missing bilateral maxillary and mandibular left second bicuspids but with retained spacing.
8.	Spacing between the maxillary laterals and cuspids.
9.	Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3-4 mm.
10.	Decreased oropharyngeal airway.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Maintain at least 1.5 mm to 2 mm of space between the upper lateral incisors and cuspids. Maintain the spacing in the upper second bicuspid area. b.	Continue to align and level mandibular arch.
2.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly and correct for any transverse problems that may be present. c.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward. d.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to finalize occlusion.
5.	Restorative dentistry. a. Placement of implants in the maxillary second bicuspid and mandibular left second bicuspid areas. b.	Place crowns on implants.

B157 MRI AGE: 14/F
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has reasonably good shape. There is some anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting in front of the condyle. The disc is a little bit deformed. There is decreased vertical joint space. There is some significant fluid in the superior joint space beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and it appears that there may a very late reduction on opening.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost some vertical height. The articular eminence is more shallow on this side. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc appears to be of lesser quality and a little more degenerated on this side than the opposite side. The disc is anteriorly displaced. There is decreased posterior and superior joint space.

The right TMJ dynamic view shows that it appears that the condyle and disc reduce earlier than on the left side. On the right side, there appears to be an early reduction, although there appears to be more loss of condylar volume on the right side than the left side. On right side on opening, the disc appears to be anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width, but may have lost a little vertical dimension. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. The articular disc appears to be laterally displaced. The vertical joint space appears narrow. The disc also appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have a little less volume than the opposite side. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. It appears that the disc also could be laterally displaced in this joint as well as anteriorly displaced.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs anteriorly and laterally displaced with early reduction on the left side and late reduction on the right side.
