B301 
B301 is 22 years old, referred by Dr. __. The illness she has had includes knee injury and also hypoglycemia. She has had previous surgery that includes tonsils and adenoids and she has had some nasal surgery to correct the deviated nasal septum. B301 has been diagnosed as having Marfans syndrome. She has hyperactive thyroid problems.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Seasonale birth control pill.
Zoloft 10 mg daily.
Zyrtec 10 mg b.i.d.
Zantac 50 mg 2 times a day.
She has had some problems with penicillin, codeine and Levaquin.

B301 's TMJ problems began at least by the age 14 or 15 or perhaps earlier. She is aware of clicking and popping in her jaw joints. She originally had her first stage of orthodontics at the age of 7 to 8 and then at the age of 12 she started full appliances. She had 4 bicuspids extracted. The braces were off at the age of 15. During this time it was noted that her jaw was becoming more retruded. This has been a progressive problem for her. In last year she went to see Dr. __ who made a bite splint for her. This did reduce her pain some. She has been referred to a chiropractic therapist but has not been there yet. She has no problems with earaches, gets occasional tinnitus and gets vertigo but no hearing loss. Her right knee bothers her. She has hyperflexibility of all of her joints. She is very much aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime but is not so sure that she does it during the day.

She does not have any headache problems at this time but prior to last year she had frequent headaches at about a level of 4. Otherwise, she rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily facial pain at 0, jaw function at 4, diet at 3 and disability at 1.

In frontal view, B301 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 5 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is 2 mm off to the right. Chin is about 6 mm off to the right side. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are fairly close to being in alignment with each other. In profile view, B301 has about 10 mm of lip incompetence when the lips are relaxed. She may have some slight AP maxillary deficiency maybe 3 to 4 mm. Intraorally, B301 is missing the lower first bicuspids. She has a lot of wear on her teeth. There is some mild crowding on the lower anterior arch. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. Significant abrasions on the cuspids, incisors and molars. In the upper arch, she is missing upper first bicuspids. Some mild crowding of the upper anterior arch. She has a Class II occlusion being probably 5 mm. She has an overjet of about 3 to 4 mm. She has about a 2 to 3 mm vertical overbite. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. The uvula and soft palate are relatively normal in length. There may be some slight transverse constricture of the faucial pillars but not too significant. B301 reports that usually from October to March she usually gets about 10 bouts of sinusitis. Intranasally, turbinates are moderately enlarged. Some constricture of the luminal valves. Intranasal tissues do look a little inflamed. B301 

Probably has some moderate nasal airway obstruction. The nostrils are a little bit narrow but the luminal valves appear somewhat constricted. To palpation she has some moderate pain of her shoulders, left styloid area, left TMJ and milder tenderness over the masseters and the temporalis muscles. Opening and closing her jaws seem to function reasonably smoothly though she says she can hear some popping occasionally in the joints. There is a certain way she can manipulate her jaw that she gets crepitus and a popping kind of sound particularly in the left joint. It sounds almost as though bone is rubbing against as she opens and shifts to slide back and goes over the articular eminence. Maximal incisal opening is 57 mm. Opening without significant discomfort 42 mm and excursive movements are about 10 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and all four first bicuspids. Roots in the lower incisors appear foreshortened but very well could be just due to the angulation of the teeth. She has severe arthritis in both TMJs. She has fairly prominent antegonial notching and extremely thick cortical bone at the inferior border of the mandible.

Waters view shows that she has fluid in the left sinus but the right sinus is clear. Frontal sinus appears clear. There is a little bit of increased cloudiness on the inferior aspect of the left side. The septum seems reasonably straight although there may be a bone spur off the superior right side in the bony septum. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. In the right side it appears to be obliterating the airway. The asymmetry in the lower arch can be seen.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is severely deformed. It is actually sitting up right behind the articular eminence and is not in centric relation. The condyle is postured forward in the fossa with increased posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Evidence of loss of condylar volume in that left joint.

Left TMJ tomogram shows that there are severe arthritic changes in the joint with loss of condylar volume. Decreased joint space appears to be present but difficult to tell. The condyle is postured slightly forward in the fossa. Articular eminence is slightly toward the shallow aspect. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both TMJs.

Lateral cephalometric radiographic shows that B301 has severely retruded mandible and significantly decreased vertical dimension of the posterior maxilla. She has a very high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway is significantly decreased with the airway at the base of the tongue being only about 3 mm and the soft palate level probably about 4 to 5 mm. Transversely, the occlusal plan is fairly flat. B301 does have problems swallowing probably related to the severe retrusion of the jaw structures and the significant decreased oropharyngeal airway space.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Marfans syndrome.
Severe bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis and severe disc degeneration.
Severe mandibular hypoplasia. B301 

Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.
High occlusal plane angle.
Class II end-on occlusion.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain.
Headaches. Myofascial pain.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction.
History of sleep apnea.
Tooth size discrepancy with a 's difference of 2+ mm.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them any further forward. CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance slightly but down graft it posteriorly and upright the incisors.
Bilateral coronoidectomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
HTR implant to anterior mandible.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation: 

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant condylar resorption. The condyle is very narrow mediolaterally. Although there is a medial osteophytic kind of growth off the remaining condylar stump, the condyle is probably a quarter of normal size. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly quite significantly probably 5 mm. There is increased soft tissue thickness in the joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle in morphology is very similar to the left side. A tremendous loss of volume. Increased thickness of the soft tissue in the joint space. Difficult to identify discal tissue on either side. However, there may be some discal tissue out laterally in this right joint. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly quite significantly again probably at least 5 mm and perhaps even slightly more on this side as compared to the opposite side. The inside of the lateral rim of the fossa in both joints almost goes straight vertically before it starts into the curvature of the roof.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant resorptive changes. A tremendous loss of vertical bone height appears evident. There is true beaking and actually posterior beaking of the condylar head. Significantly increased vertical joint space. There is no evidence of discal tissue as it is likely degenerated in the tissue mass within the joint. There could be reactive pannus in there as the tissue does look somewhat amorphus. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. There may be some evidence of discal tissue remaining in the socket area but very difficult to identify in the T1 films if it is present at all. In opening, there is fairly good translation. In the open views, there does appear that there is some discal remnant that remains anterior to the condyle with severe degenerative changes. In the open views, the condyle does come down beneath the articular eminence and this little mass of tissue remains anterior to the eminence itself. On another view, there appears to be a little bit more discal tissue present but severely deformed. It appears that the discal tissue that is present is towards the very lateral aspect of the joint but is very narrow anteroposteriorly and quite thick.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has severe degenerative changes with erosions at the condylar head and significant loss of condylar volume. Increased joint space vertically and posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There may be some remnants of articular disc sitting beneath the articular eminence but very severely deformed. In the T2 films it is possible there could be either discal tissue or compressed tissue superior and posterior to the condoyle. On open views, some disc can be seen sitting beneath the articular eminence and on opening the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. The disc is significantly deformed and is quite thick and short anteroposteriorly.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe resorptive arthritic changes and articular disc are anteriorly displaced with severe deformation and likely nonsalvageable.
