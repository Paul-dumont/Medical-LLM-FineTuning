B499
B499 is referred by the TMJ Association, . B499 is 60 years old. Her problems began at the age of 53. Her dentist told her that she needed some spacing closed or she would have difficulties in the future. This started a major downhill slide leaving B499 severely compromised. She went from having a relatively normal occlusion to where she has just some retained roots of the maxillary first and second molars bilaterally with two remaining implants in the upper jaw and missing mandibular left central incisor and left first molar. All four third molars are absent. At one point, there were ten implants placed in the upper jaw and eight of them have now been removed with only two remaining. B499 has very methodically outlined her treatment to date.

B499 rates her headaches at about a level of 8 in the frontal and temporal area bilaterally. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 8, diet at 5, disability at 9. She gets earaches on the left side occasionally, but has continuous tinnitus. She gets occasional vertigo and has hearing loss in the left ear. She has left leg stress fractures and also this involves the left side of her foot. She has right shoulder problems as well as hip problems. She has chronic left side fatigue. She is aware of clenching her teeth during the day, but not aware as to whether she does it at night.

To palpation, she has high moderate pain over the TMJs and moderate pain over the masseters, posterior neck, and mild discomfort over the shoulders. On opening she has a click on both sides with the right side being somewhat softer than the left side. On the left side, the opening click is at about 20 mm and a closing click at 15 mm. On the right side, the opening click is probably a little bit earlier at 15 with a closing click at about 10. She takes the following medications:

ASA 81 mg q.d.
Multiple vitamin supplements.
He diagnoses list would include the following:
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocations.
Absence of all maxillary teeth except for the first and second molars bilaterally.
Missing mandibular left central incisor and left first molar.
Lingual inclination of lower incisors.
Maxillary alveolar ridge atrophy.
Two osteointegrated implants in the maxilla with questionable stability.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Clenching.

I had Dr. XXXX come and evaluate B499 with me, and her treatment plan at this point in time would be as follows:
Treatment of clenching with Klonopin 1-mg tablets 1 tablet q.h.s. Consultation with Dr. XXXX.
Orthodontics on the lower arch to align and level the lower arch, opening up space for the missing left central incisor as well as space around the deformed left cuspid. This will tip the lower incisors forward into a better position over basal bone. Surgery Stage 1: Bone grafting to maxilla including sinus lift procedures as well as augmenting anteriorly and vertically on the alveolar ridge. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Osteointegrated dental implant placement to include four or more implants. The current maxillary implants will likely require removal.
Surgery Stage 2: Placement of interosseus implants. Restorative dentistry to reconstruct the arches.

B499 MRI
AGE: 60/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little arthritic. Disc appears to be medially displaced. The condyle appears to have good mediolateral width. Joint space looks fairly good throughout however. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The disc appears to be anteriorly and laterally displaced.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has flattening on the posterior head. The disc appears to be in reasonably good position. At the most lateral aspect of the joint, the disc may be anteriorly displaced. On opening, there appears to be good translation of the condyle and the disc bilaterally.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the posterior head. It appears that the disc is in position, but it does appear a little bit degenerated. There appears to be a little bit of grayish kind tissue surrounding the disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular discs in reasonably good position, although the left one may be anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint and the right one may be laterally displaced.
