B245 is 17 years old. Birth date is . She is in good health with no major medical problems. She has had an adverse reaction to Keflex. She is referred by Dr. .

B245 problems began 2 years ago at the age of 15 of unknown etiology. She began having some popping in her joints and some difficulties with jaw function. Primary concerns at this time include the following:
Decreased jaw opening. Jaw pain. Headaches.
Difficulties eating and chewing.

She has had previous orthodontic treatment from the age of 12 to 13. She gets right-sided earaches, but no tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. She has no other joint problems, and she is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She gets headaches about two times a week that occur predominantly in the right temporal area at about a level of 4. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 7, diet at 6, and disability at 4. She does have some problems breathing through her nose at night particularly when she sleeps, but has no sleep apnea symptoms.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B245 has fairly good left-to-right facial asymmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 6 mm. The maxillary midline may be just slightly off to the left side 1 mm. Mandibular dental midline and chin appear to be fairly close to the facial midline. The nasal tip may be about 2 mm off to the left side. In profile view, she may have just some slight AP maxillary deficiency of about 2 mm. The chin may be AP deficient at about 3-4 mm. The lower third face appears elongated. B245 has a lip incompetency of about 7 mm. Intraorally, she has got all of her lower teeth back to the second molars. Teeth are fairly nicely aligned and level. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back to the second molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has about 1 mm overjet and about 1 mm vertical overbite. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal. The tonsils are moderately enlarged with the left side being a little bit larger than the right side. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged. There may be some moderate nasal airway obstruction. There is no snoring or history of daytime somnolence or sleep apnea symptoms. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the right masseter and right TMJ area. Joints seems to function smoothly today, but she says she does get clicking and popping in her joints but with that noise being mainly on the right side. Maximal incisal opening is 35 mm, but only 24 mm without discomfort. Excursion movements are about 7 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of bilateral mandibular third molars and maxillary left third molar. Sinuses look relatively clear. The septum looks relatively straight. The right condyle looks a little bit smaller than the left condyle. Waters view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Turbinates are moderate in size and the left side of the nose appears blocked more so than the right side. Bony septum is reasonably straight. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be positioned superiorly and posteriorly in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be decreased joint space. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit smaller in size than the opposite side. Joint space appears a little bit greater on this side. The articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is moderate translation in both joints, there being slightly greater translation on the left side as compared to the right side.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B245 has a vertical maxillary excess and high occlusal plane angle and a skeletal Class II relationship, although the occlusion is Class I. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue measures about 6 mm, but at the soft palate level measures about 9 mm. She demonstrates a lip incompetence of about 7 mm. Tooth size analysis shows only a 's difference of about 0.5 mm. Basic diagnoses for B245 would be as follows:
Vertical maxillary hyperplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia.
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation.
Impacted third molars bilaterally in the mandible and maxillary left third molar.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Nasal airway obstruction.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Be sure lateral incisor roots are tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies, if they are necessary.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Multiple maxillary osteotomies. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x3.
Bilateral partial turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B245 MRI EVALUATION 
AGE: 18/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ oblique view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. It appears to have cortical bone surrounding it. A little bit of flattening in the anterior head. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Condyle appears narrow anteroposteriorly.

Right TMJ oblique view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology, although anteroposteriorly, particularly towards the medial side of the joint. Laterally, it is a little bit wider and similar to the opposite site. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced.

Axial view of bilateral TMJ shows fairly good mediolateral width, although more narrow in the medial aspect of the condyle than the lateral aspect.
IMPRESSION:

Bilateral TMJ articular disc anteriorly dislocated.
