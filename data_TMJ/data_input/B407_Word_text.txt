B407  
DOB: 
B407 is 14 years old. She is referred by Dr. XX. She currently takes amoxicillin and Prolex. B407 's joint problems began when she was about 10 years of age. She became aware at that time of her jaw getting out of place and this most likely probably means that her disc started to click and pop. Etiology is unknown. She has had no treatment to date. She gets headaches about 5 times a month at about a level of 3 but she is not sure at this time where they specifically occur. It may be in the temple areas. She has no pain directly in the jaw joints. She rates her average daily pain at 2, jaw function 0, diet at 2, disability at 0. She has no problems with earaches but does get some tinnitus and some vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She may be predominately a mouth breather particularly at night when she sleeps. She has some snoring but apparently no evidence of sleep apnea at this time.

In frontal view, B407 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is about 1 to 2 mm to the left. The chin is fairly close to being on the facial midline. She has some slight orbital dystopia with the left eye being up about 2 mm. In profile view, nasal dorsum is somewhat prominent. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale. Upper lip is retruded about 4 to 6 mm. Chin is retruded at 20+ mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short and chin-neck angle is poorly defined. Lower third face appears elongated. She has some significant lip incompetence of probably about 8 to 10 mm. Intraorally, B407 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has severe crowding in the lower anterior arch with lower cuspids being blocked completely out of the arch. Transversely the arch is extremely constricted. On the left side even the first bicuspid is partially blocked out of the arch. All 4 incisors are lingual to the bicuspids and cuspids. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. A little bit of crowding in the anterior arch. She has basically a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side but Class I end-on on the left side by probably 2 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of at least 5 mm. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 1.5 mm lower than the left side. Oropharyngeal area appears relatively clear. She has a cold right now so there is some mucoid kind of drainage down the back of the throat. Intranasally she has a cold so there is a lot of mucous drainage. Left turbinate appears quite enlarged. The right side could not be seen very well but anterior it did not look too bad but could not see posteriorly. Septum appears reasonably straight. Columella appeared a little bit wide and nostrils appear somewhat constricted. Intraorally, uvula is relatively normal in length. Soft palate appears somewhat elongated but the faucial pillars appear to have good width. To palpation she has some very mild tenderness over the right styloid are and right posterior neck area. On opening, she has fairly good producible click on the left side of about 20 mm of opening and occasionally there would be a double click on that left side. Sometimes a detectable closing click of probably about 10 mm. On the right side, joint functions relatively smoothly.  

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of all 4 third molars. Sinuses appear a little bit cloudy. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. Condyles appear a little bit small in size and the vertical height of the ramus appears a little bit short vertically.

Waters view shows that there is an air-fluid level in both sinuses with more fluid in the right side as compared to the left side compatible with her currently having an upper respiratory infection. Nasal septum appears somewhat deviated in the bony section. Turbinates are moderately enlarged being a little bit greater on the left side than the right side but there may be a spur off the septum posteriorly on the right side. The ethmoid sinuses may be a little bit cloudy.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is a little bit smaller in size. Head and neck appears to be somewhat shorter than expected. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space may be somewhat compromised.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that seems to be superiorly and posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There may be some loss of volume on this side in the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The joint space is greater anteriorly than it is posteriorly. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a significant head postured forward neck position. At approximately the third and fourth vertebrae, the anatomy is a little bit unusual there. Relative to the jaws, she has some anterior vertical maxillary excess and AP maxillary deficiency and significant AP mandibular deficiency. She has a high occlusal plane angle. There is a decreased oropharyngeal airway space. On her x-rays she may have had her tongue postured forward because of requirements for breathing at this time. On previous x-ray taken earlier this yearf at Dr. XX' office, the oropharyngeal airway is severely constricted with only 3 mm from the soft palate to the posteropharyngeal wall and maybe 4 to 5 mm from the base of the tongue to the posteropharyngeal wall. She has a significant skeletal Class II jaw relationship. B407 , according to her mother, has low energy level and is not very active. There are frequent times that she feels as though she has to take a nap or would like to take a nap at least in the afternoon at least twice a week.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ adolescent internal condylar resorption.
Severe AP mandibular deficiency.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Anterior vertical maxillary excess of posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Class II end-on occlusion on the left side with basically a Class I cuspid on the right side.
Severe crowding in the lower anterior arch.
Moderate crowding of maxillary anterior arch.
Impacted third molars x4.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction.
 

Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Snoring. Daytime somnolence. High occlusal plane angle.
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Surgery stage 1.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
Midline mandibular vertical osteotomy.
Construction and placement of distraction device.
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible. Hold for 4 months.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 3 mm of tooth structure as well as the lower bicuspids removing 0.5 mm per tooth. Surgery stage 2.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, move the anterior aspect superiorly, down graft the posterior aspect and correct any transverse discrepancy that may be present. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomy to advance the mandible forward approximately 22 mm.
Bilateral inferior turbinectomies. Consider possible small augmentation genioplasty. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B407 MRI Evaluation 
Age: 14/F
DOB:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat small. Appears to have lost some volume vertically as well as mediolaterally. There is decreased superior joint space. It appears there is lateral displacement of the articular disc. Cortical bone appears somewhat thin. Condyle appears narrow anteroposteriorly. There appears to be discal tissue displaced anteriorly.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is small in size and appears to have lost vertical and mediolateral volume. Cortical bone appears somewhat thin. Joint space appears somewhat narrowed vertically. There could be some discal tissue displaced laterally. There is discal tissue that appears to be displaced anteriorly.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost vertical volume. There is significant anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep and slightly elongated. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. It is more prominent towards the lateral aspect of the joint and less prominent perhaps towards the medial aspect. There appears to be amorphous kind of tissue surrounding the condylar head. No particular inflammatory process seen around the joint. There is a little bit of fluid in the anterior superior joint space towards the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle where it comes down beneath the articular eminence but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost some vertical volume. There is anterior beaking present. Articular eminence appears to be fairly steep and steeper than the opposite side. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is extremely short anteroposteriorly and appears significant degenerated. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not too significant. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction and severely deformed.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ condylar resorption with anterior displacement of articular disc with significant deformation and non-reducing. Right TMJ condylar resorption with anterior displacement of the articular disc with significant deformation and non-reducing. Condition compatible with adolescent internal condylar resorption.
Discs may not be salvageable.
