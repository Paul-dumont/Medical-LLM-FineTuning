B219
B219 is 27 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX.
Patient History
She has two children, the first one born 9 years ago and then 2 years ago. She has had some periodontal surgery. B219 is in good health. She did have asthma when she was younger. She takes no medications. She has also been to see Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX. B219's problems began 19 months ago. She apparently had a dental appointment and had a bite block placed for about 2-1/2 hours while she had some dental work done. After removal of the bite block, she had difficulties closing her jaw. She really had no significant symptoms prior to that episode. She probably had some dislocation of the condyles at that time as she had difficulties closing down. She was finally able to manipulate it and get the jaw closed. She began developing pain that day when she got a throbbing and pinching kind of sensation in the jaw area. She began developing swelling on the right side. She saw Dr. XXXX, who told her she had a sprained jaw. She then went to see Dr. XXXX, her family physician, who noticed swelling and pain and suggested she get an MRI, which was then performed in 7 months ago, so she went about a year thinking it was basically a sprained jaw until the MRI was obtained. B219 then went to see Dr. XXXX following the MRI. Dr. XXXX made a splint for B219 which she wore continuously for six months. She also underwent physical therapy with iontophoresis. She had three or four treatments with the iontophoresis but saw no improvement with that. The splint was also ineffective in reducing her pain and discomfort. Dr. XXXX made a splint for B219 about 6 months ago. She does wear it at night yet and sometimes during the day when she is exercising to keep from clenching her jaws. She was given a cream ointment to apply to her face as well and to the jaw area, but this was ineffective also.

B219 has problems with earaches on the right side. She has a continuous ear problem where she feels she has fluid and pressure in the right ear. She has no tinnitus or vertigo. She does having loss on the right side that is predominantly there in the morning when she wakes up. She has no other joint problems. Her knees do pop but are not uncomfortable. She is aware of nocturnal clenching and bruxing. She gets headaches about two or three times per week that occur in the posterior head area bilaterally at about a level of 5. She rates her TMJ pain that occurs on the right side only at a level of 10 particularly in the afternoons and evenings. It is particularly bad in the evenings when she begins to yawn. She rates her average daily pain level at 8, jaw function at 7, diet at 6, and disability at 7. Regarding the right ear, when she was younger she jumped into a swimming pool and “busted” her eardrum, and she has had some problems with that ear since that time, but they have gotten significantly worse since developing the jaw joint problems. She has had her ear evaluated since the onset of these problems, and the ear doctor said that the ear is essentially normal.

Patient Concerns
1. Right-sided jaw pain
2. Right ear pain
3. Feeling of fluid in the ear
4. Decreased hearing on the right side particularly in the a.m.
5. Headaches
6. Difficulties eating and chewing
7. Yawning significantly increases pain
8. When jaw is held open (i.e. for dental work), she has difficulties closing her jaw for a while after that

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B219 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary, mandibular, and chin midlines are all pretty much on the facial midline. Nasal tip is just a little bit off toward the left side about 2 mm.

In profile, B219 has good facial balance. Chin-neckline may be just slightly short, but chin-neck angle is reasonably well-defined. When B219 was younger, she had orthodontists twice and wore headgear for part of that treatment time. When she was about 9 or 10 years old, she did have a bike accident and did get an abrasion on the right side of her face and said she hit pretty hard, but she is unaware of any problems after that.

Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars in the lower arch but is missing the maxillary second molars and the third molars up above. Has just a slight Class II cuspid relationship of a millimeter or 2. She has a vertical overbite of about 3 mm. Oropharynx is clear, and the tissues look normal and healthy.

To palpation, B219 has high moderate tenderness over the right TMJ and moderate tenderness over the right masseter. Maximal incisal opening is 30 mm but only 15 mm without pain. Excursive movements to the right are 3 mm and to the left 1 mm.

Intranasally, septum is deviated just slightly off to the right side. Turbinates are of moderate size but not causing any significant airway obstruction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of maxillary second and third molars and mandibular third molars. She has a root canal in the mandibular right second molar. She has crowns on the mandibular right first and second molar and maxillary first molar but a lot of other restorations on the posterior teeth in the upper right quadrant and lower left quadrant. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Turbinates appear reasonable in size with the left one being a little bit larger than the right one. Left condyle appears a little bit flattened on the anterior aspect of it. Right TMJ appears arthritic as though there have been some significant bony changes.

Waters view shows a little cloudiness in the left maxillary sinus. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Septum is a little bit deviated but not too bad. Jaws appear relatively symmetric.

Right TMJ tomogram shows and articular eminence that has a moderate slope to it. Joint space actually looks fairly good particularly posteriorly although may be slightly decreased vertically. The bone on the superior head of the condyle appears somewhat abnormal and does not appear to be as smooth as would be considered normal. Appear to be degenerative changes on the head of the condyle. Toward the lateral aspect of the joint, the articular eminence is a little bit steeper.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has flattening on the posterior head. Significantly decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep but not as steep as the opposite side. One would suspect that the disc may be anteriorly displaced in a vertical orientation but with early reduction, and in concert with the clinical examination, the disc reduction may be in a pre-click position.

Open views show bilateral restricted translation. On the right side, there appears to be decreased joint space between the condyle and the articular eminence. On the left side, there is more restriction of translation than the right side, and there likewise appears to be some uneven bone and decreased space between the head of the condyle and the articular eminence.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows she is slightly skeletal Class II, but with some dental compensations she is fairly close to being a Class I occlusion, although perhaps 1 to 2 mm Class II in occlusion. Oropharygeal airway looks good. Facial balance is acceptable.

Other Systems
She has no other joint problems except her knees do pop but are otherwise asymptomatic. She does have some polyuria, but she drinks a lot of water during the day. She has had no fertility problems and no miscarriages. She has two children, ages 9 years and 2 years. She has had the diagnosis of caffeine deposits in her breasts. She had cryosurgery x 1 for cervical problems that apparently were associated with an IUD that she developed an allergic response to. She has had previous gum surgery and had periodontosis secondary to smoking. No ocular problems. She does get some sinus problems associated to allergies, and she does have allergies to dogs and cats. She smoked for about 8 years from the age of 15 to 23 one pack a day. She gets right-sided earaches and has some decreased hearing on the right side. She had asthma in her childhood but has outgrown that. No history of bronchitis or pneumonia. No GI problems. No STDs. No exposure to birds. She has had about 15 cats during her life, and some of them did eat birds. She has had dogs x 2 but no exposure to hoofed animals. She did have a previous implant that was an IUD which did contain copper that she had an allergic response to, and that was the reason that she had to have the cryosurgery done because of some lesions apparently created by the allergic response. She also states she is allergic to gold, silver, and perhaps even some other alloys. She says gold rings will actually make her fingers swell. She does have allergy to CHOCOLATE, CAFFEINE, COKE, PEAS, etc. They minimize her caffeine intake and do not keep caffeinated beverages around the house normally. She has chocolate occasionally, but that is increased more recently as they had some chocolate around the house, but that is gone now.

Basic Diagnoses
1. Right TMJ reactive arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction
2. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
3. Severe TMJ pain
4. Headaches
5. Myofascial pain
6. Earaches predominantly on the right side and continuous
7. Decreased hearing on the right side
8. Nocturnal clenching and bruxism

Recommended Treatment
1. Evaluation at the Dallas Environmental Center for hypersensitivities to titanium, aluminum, vanadium, and nickel
2. Consider use of medications to help control her symptoms and decrease the reactive arthritis in the TMJs A. Anti-inflammatory such as Celebrex, Motrin, etc. B. Antibiotics to try to decrease inflammatory response possibly created by bacterial/viral factors, i.e. doxycycline, Levaquin, Zithromax, etc. C. Klonopin taken at bedtime to decrease nocturnal clenching and bruxism
3. Surgery A. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors B. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies with bone screw stabilization C. Application of arch bars to control occlusion during and postsurgery

MRI Scan Evaluation
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Reading:
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Slightly decreased joint space particularly out laterally. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of probably a couple of millimeters. Discal tissue just medial to the medial aspect of the condyle. Disc appears it is probably anteriorly displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Lateral pole is significantly lower than the medial pole. Bone on the roof of the fossa is extremely thin.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral pole of the condyle extends beyond rim of the fossa. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. Decreased joint space between the condyle and lateral rim. Cortical bone of the fossa appears a little bit thicker on this side as compared to the opposite side.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that demonstrates some flattening on the anterior head, and in one area out laterally it appears that there may be a little peaking and osteophytic formation on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence. Appears a little bit foreshortened anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence toward the lateral aspect is fairly steep. Disc appears to be in sort of vertical orientation in that area.

On opening, the disc appears to reduce. Translation appears somewhat restricted.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit more arthritic on this side than the opposite side. More flattening anteriorly and a little bit of anterior beaking present. Decreased posterior joint space. Articular eminence is quite steep on this side and a little bit steeper than the opposite side and longer in vertical length. May be a little sclerosis in the head of the condyle. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Disc is a little bit foreshortened and thickened. Some peaking on the condylar head. Appears to be a little bit of inflammation in the bilaminar tissues adjacent to the anterosuperior aspect of the condylar head.

On opening, there is restricted translation, and the disc appears to be nonreducing.
Impression:
1. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction but with restricted translation
2. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and limited translation

MEETING WITH DR. XXXX:
Right TMJ has significant arthritis. Articular disc is anteriorly dislocated and is nonreducing. There is some movement of the disc forward on opening, although it remains nonreducing. Disc is deformed and short anteroposteriorly.

Left TMJ shows a steep articular eminence and a disc that is in a vertical orientation and anteriorly displaced. Probably an early reduction as the disc is reduced on opening. There is significant restriction of translation in both joints. Out laterally on the left condyle, there is a fairly large osteophyte extending superiorly from the condylar head.

Impression:
1. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with deformation
2. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction
