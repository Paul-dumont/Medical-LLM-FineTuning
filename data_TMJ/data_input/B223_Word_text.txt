B223
B223 is 21 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
1. Pain in the jaws, particularly the jaw joints.
2. Grinding of her teeth at night.
3. Lower jaws becoming more receded.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
1. Amitriptyline.
2. Yasmin.
3. Spironolactone.
She has worn a nightguard from 7 years ago to the present. B223 gets earaches bilaterally. She has problems with tinnitus and vertigo. No other joints bother. She is allergic to penicillin. No known problems with jewelry except she does not like to wear it. She does clench and grind her teeth at nighttime and sometimes during the day. She gets headaches in the temporal and posterior head area at about a level of three and these occur about three to four times per month. When she is under stress, her pain factors are much worse. She rates her average TMJ pain about a level of 4, average daily pain at 2, jaw function at 0, diet at 1, disability at 1. B223 had some kind of orthodontic work done when she was about five. Then she had full braces from the age of 10 to 12-1/2. She has had splint treatments from 7 years ago until the present.

In frontal view, B223 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. In profile view, she has some problems in the nasal dorsum. The maxilla appears to be AP deficient by probably about 3 to 4 mm. Chin is AP deficient probably by 15 to 20 mm. Intraorally, B223 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding of lower anterior arch. She has adequate attached gingiva for the most part around the lower anterior teeth. The tissue is fairly thin over the cuspids. In the upper arch, B223 has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has a Class II end-on cuspid molar relationship bilaterally. She has a 0 overbite relationship. She probably has about a 4 mm overjet relationship. It appears that she hits primarily on her molars and the rest of her teeth are probably out of occlusion. Posterior teeth are quite worn and flattened. This dental attrition is likely from her clenching and bruxism. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars are all within normal limits. Tonsils are a little bit enlarged but not too significant. Intranasally, the turbinates appear enlarged but the septum appears relatively straight. She is not aware of any problems with snoring, daytime somnolence or sleep apnea problems. She does get nightmares. She has rather mild to moderate tenderness over the temporalis, masseters, TMJs and right styloid area. B223 does get clicking and popping in her TMJs with an opening click on the right side about 25 mm, closing click of 20 and on the left side opening click about 35 m and closing click about 20. Maximal incisal opening is about 59 mm and excursive movements are about 10 mm in each direction. Tooth size analysis reveals a Bolton's difference of 3 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows absence of the wisdom teeth but all the rest of the teeth are present. Sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear enlarged. Condyles appear arthritic and appear to have lost volume.

Left TMJ tomogram shows that she is postured forward unfortunately in this tomogram and there is decreased anterior joint space and increased superior and posterior joint space. X-ray was not taken in centric relation.

Right TMJ tomogram likewise shows arthritis in the joints and moderate steepness of the articular eminence. Condyle is postured forward in the fossa as she is not in centric relation. Increased superior and posterior joint space. Open view shows good translation of both condyles.

Waters view shows the sinuses are relatively clear. The nasal septum is deviated and she appears to have spurring off to the right side. Turbinates appear enlarged particularly on the left side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship and a retruded maxilla and mandible. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Steep occlusal plane angle. Class II occlusion and Class II skeletal relationship.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
1. Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and questionable salvageability.
2. AP maxillary deficiency.
3. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
4. AP mandibular deficiency.
5. AP microgenia.
6. High occlusal plane angle.
7. Class II end-on occlusion.
8. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3 mm.
9. Over-angulation of lower incisors.
10. Crowding of lower anterior teeth.
11. Hypertrophied turbinates.
12. Nasal airway obstruction.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize lower anterior teeth removing 3 mm of tooth structure in the anterior six teeth to correct for the tooth size discrepancy. Also consider slenderizing the lower first and second bicuspids and retracting holding posterior anchorage to try and minimize any further flaring of the lower incisors.
2. Surgery. a. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the mandible in counterclockwise direction. d. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it, decrease occlusal plane angle and down graft the posterior aspect. e. Augmentation genioplasty. f. Bilateral partial reduction and turbinectomies.

B223 MRI Evaluation
Age: 21/F Date of Birth:
Date of MRI Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is small in size mediolaterally and appears to have lost significant volume. Decreased superior joint space. Significant downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa probably about 4 to 5 mm. There may be discal tissue displaced medially. The disc also appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is small in size and appears to have lost significant volume. Some narrowing anteroposteriorly and vertically. Actually there appears to be increased joint space vertically here as compared to the opposite side. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of about 3 mm or so. Discal tissue may be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone arthritic changes. It appears to have lost vertical volume. Some anterior beaking is present. Joint space is decreased some. There appears to be an osteophyte off the posterior superior aspect of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly, however, it may still be salvageable. A little bit of fluid present in the posterior joint space. A little bit of fluid beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. The disc appears small compared to the size of the condyle. In fact, it may be difficult to salvage.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is small in size. A little bit of anterior beaking present in some views. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Decreased posterior joint space. The disc is anteriorly displaced and severely degenerated and deformed. There may be a little bit of fluid in the joint spaces but not too significant. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. In the open view, the disc is severely deformed. Question salvageability of this disc.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated without reduction with significant deformation.
2. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and significant degeneration and deformation.
