B411 
B411 is 14 years old and referred by Dr. XX.
Patient History
She has had foot surgery for ingrown toenails x 2. She does have some allergy problems and gets a stuffy nose at times.

B411 does get some earaches with clenching, but an ENT doctor told her about five months ago to stop clenching her teeth, and this has alleviated her earaches fairly significantly. She has no tinnitus, vertigo, and no hearing loss. The only other joints that bother her include her neck and her elbows. She is allergic to POLLENS, DUST, etc., but has no known allergies to jewelry. She is not aware of clenching or grinding her teeth at night at this time. She rates her headaches at a level of 6 that she gets about two times per month currently during the summer, but during the school year, they are more common. She rates them at a level of 6 in the frontal and temporal areas. She rates her TMJ pain on the average at 5, but it can escalate to 8. On an average day she has a pain level at about a level of 5. She rates her jaw function at 0, diet at 1, and disability at 1.

Current Medications
Zyrtec Rhinocort
She has taken Concerta
She more currently is taking Strattera. This is for ADD and for ADHD.
Patient Concerns
She only touches on her very back teeth
Front teeth and most of the side teeth do not touch
The teeth are crooked

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B411 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 0 to -1. Maxillary dental midline is about a millimeter to the right. Mandibular dental midline and chin are pretty much on the facial midline.

In profile view, she has fairly good AP facial balance. Chin-neckline looks relatively normal in length, and chin-neck angle is fairly well-defined.
Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Has really thin attached gingiva around the lower central incisors. A little bit of spacing around some of the lower anterior teeth, particularly the lateral incisors and cuspids, cuspids and first bicuspids.

In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Has a slight Class III tendency on the left side, closer to a Class I on the right side. Cuspids are unerupted at this time. She has about a 1-mm open bite between the incisors and has an end-on incisor relationship. Upper lateral incisors appear a little bit small in size. Oropharynx appears clear.

Intranasally, the right airway looks very open and clear and turbinate is of moderate size. Left one is a little bit larger than the right side with it just a little bit more constricted of the airway but seems to be adequate.

To palpation, she has some moderate pain over the TMJs and mild tenderness over the styloid areas. Joint function seems to be relatively smooth. Maximal incisal opening is 59 mm, but without significant discomfort 37 mm. Excursive movements are about 7 mm in each direction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex evaluation: Sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear moderately large with the left one being larger than the right one. Four third molars are present and developing. Condylar heads and necks appear a little bit elongated. Appears to have an accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch with the upper six teeth being elevated compared to the posterior four teeth.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with a good shape and morphology. Fossa and articular eminence also look like they have good morphology. Moderately shallow articular eminence but with good spacing around it.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle also with good morphology as is the fossa and articular eminence. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Appears to be good joint space around the condylar head and neck area.

In both joints, the condylar heads and necks appear somewhat elongated.
Opening views show excellent translation of both condyles anterior to the articular eminence.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are all clear. Not much development in the maxillary sinus area. Left turbinate is larger than the right turbinate and appears to block a portion of the nasal airway.

Cephalometrically, B411 appears to have a skeletal Class III jaw relationship. She has some adenoid tissue still remaining in the nasopharynx. Oropharyngeal airway at the level of the soft palate measures 5 mm and at the base of the tongue measures 8 mm. Upper incisors appear overangulated, but lower incisors appear to be in fairly good angulation.

Basic Diagnoses
AP maxillary deficiency
Vertical maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular prognathism
Anterior open bite where she occludes on the second bicuspids through the second molars only, and the anterior teeth are all out of occlusion
Class I cuspid relationship on the right side, slight Class III cuspid relationship on the left side (1 to 2 mm)
Accentuated curve of occlusion, upper arch
Spacing in both the upper and lower anterior arches
Rule out bilateral condylar hyperplasia
Rule out TMJ articular disc dislocations
TMJ pain

Headaches Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4
Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies
Align and level mandibular arch

MRI to be performed to evaluate TMJ disposition
Growth assessment to determine if there is condylar hyperplasia evident
Surgery
Consider possible bilateral TMJ high condylectomies (if condylar hyperplasia is confirmed) and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors (if articular disc dislocation is identified or if condylar hyperplasia is present)
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward and downgraft it slightly anteriorly
Possible bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies if TMJ surgery is done to keep mandible in its proper anatomical alignment
Surgical removal of impacted third molars x 4

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B411  MRI Scan Evaluation   
Date of Acquisition:	  

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit flattened on top. Decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Disc appears to be medially displaced. Relatively flat lateral rim of the fossa. Cortex appears to be intact on the condyle as well as on the fossa.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that likewise appears somewhat flat on top, although the cortex is intact. Lateral rim of the fossa is very flat. Decreased superior joint space. Disc appears to be medially displaced

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows no cut through the lateral pole of the condyle, so difficult to tell from this view if the disc is medially displaced. On the views taken, the disc appears to be in reasonable position. A little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space.

On opening, the disc and condyle appear to translate well. The condyle moves forward beneath the articular eminence as does the disc.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a little bit of flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. The disc appears to be in reasonable position. The disc is quite thin and is slightly anteriorly displaced but not too significantly. A little bit of fluid in the joint space but not much.

On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, and both condyle and disc translate forward beneath the articular eminence. Articular eminence itself is moderately steep. Relatively normal articular disc position.

Impression:
Relatively normal left TMJ with possible slight medial dislocation of the disc
2. Right TMJ anterior and medial disc displacement
