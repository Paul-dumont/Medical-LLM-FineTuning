B349 
B349 is 19 years old.
Patient History
B349 is in good health.
B349 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, gets occasional vertigo, but no hearing loss. She is aware that she does clench her teeth at night, and she usually wakes up with headaches and soreness in her jaws. She gets headaches in the frontal and temporal areas that she registers at about a level of 4. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 5, diet at 6, and disability at 2.\

B349's problems may have begun as long as 8 to 9 years ago when she would wake up with headaches. However, it has only been over the past two years that she has been aware of having clicking and popping noises in her jaw joints.

Current Medications
Adderall 20 mg
Prozac 25 mg 1 time a week
Patient Concerns
Jaw joint noises
Headaches
Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B349 has good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 to 5 mm.

In profile view, she has fairly good facial balance. May be just some slight AP deficiency in the chin area of probably about 4 to 5 mm.
Intraorally, B349 has all of her teeth back through the second molars erupted in, and the right third tooth are just peeking through a little bit. In the upper arch, she has all of her upper teeth back through the second molars. She has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. Has similar facets on the upper cuspids. Oropharynx is clear. Teeth are in good repair. Has about a 2-mm anterior overbite relationship.

To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the masseters, TMJs, and styloid areas.
On opening, she has a click at about 30 mm of opening and reciprocal click at about 20 in the right joint. Left joint seems to function reasonably smoothly. I could not detect any particular noises in excursive movements. Maximal incisal opening is about 55 mm but only about 25 mm with reasonable comfort. Excursive movements are 9 mm in each direction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the presence of all four third molars with three of them being bony impacted and the right third molar being partially soft tissue impacted. Sinuses look clear. Turbinates look relatively normal in size. Condyles appear a little bit flattened anteriorly.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology. Joint space may be a little bit decreased superiorly and posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is a little bit flattened anteriorly. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

On opening, there is good translation of both condyles with the condyles coming significantly anteriorly to the articular eminence.
Cephalometrically, B349 has basically a Class I skeletal and occlusal relationship. Bony chin might be slightly retruded. Some adenoid tissue remaining in the nasopharynx. Good oropharyngeal airway otherwise.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reduction
Mandibular hyperplasia
Headaches TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
History of nocturnal clenching

Recommended Treatment
Medications
Klonopin 0.5 mg, 1 tablet q.h.s. to eliminate nocturnal clenching and bruxism
Presurgical orthodontics A.	Align and level maxillary arch B.	Align and level mandibular arch

Surgery
A.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors
B.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies with bone screw stabilization

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B349  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition:	
Date of Reading: 
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Relatively shallow downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of about 2 mm. Appears to be discal tissue medial to the condyle. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. There is a decreased joint space vertically. Appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle.

Left TMJ, sagittal view: These actually were not included, and this reading is being done off of the opening sequence. Condyle appears to have a fairly good shape, but there is a little bit of anterior beaking and a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Condyle appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Disc is not readily visible.

On opening, there appears to be reduction of the disc and good translation of the condyle.
Addendum: Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some flattening of the anterior head. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced but appears to be in better position over medially. Cortical bones appear to be intact. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Disc is not as well visualized out laterally.

On opening, the articular disc appears to reduce, and translation is moderately good.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has some flattening of the superior head and some anterior beaking present. Disc appears to be anteriorly positioned. Appears that it does reduce on opening.

Addendum: Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears to be superiorly and posteriorly seated in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Just some anterior beaking present. Out laterally, the disc is clearly seen to be anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence.

On the right side, translation is moderately good, and the articular disc also appears to reduce.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteromedially displaced with reduction.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc displaced anteriorly with reduction.
