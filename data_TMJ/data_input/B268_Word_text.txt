B268 
B268 is 20 years old and is referred by Dr. __. She has had three sets of tubes in her ears and adenoids and tonsils removed. She has some sinus problems. She takes Prozac 20 mg daily and she takes birth control medication. She takes Naproxen 500 mg p.r.n. She gets earaches, tinnitus and occasional vertigo. The only other joint that really bothers her is her left shoulder. She has some clenching at nighttime and during the day. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, facial pain and headaches at 4, headaches at 4 in the temple and top of the head area.

In frontal view, B268 has good left to right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 mm. Maxillary midline is shifted about 1.5 mm to the left. Mandibular dental midline is shifted probably 5 mm to the left. Chin is probably about 6 mm to the left. In profile view, B268 has fairly good facial balance. She has fairly good chin projection. There may be just some slight deficiency in the maxillary projection may be 2 to 3 mm. Otherwise, she has good facial balance. Intraorally B268 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Teeth appear to be fairly well aligned and leveled. Lower incisors are tipped lingually. She has a little bit of spacing around the right and left cuspids. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. Maxillary left cuspid is about 1 mm posterior to the right cuspid. The lower arch appears fairly symmetry. Slight cant in the occlusal plane with the right cuspid being about 1 mm lower than the left cuspid. She has a Class III end-on cuspid relationship on the right side being probably about 3 to 4 mm Class III and on the left side is a little bit closer to being a Class I. She has a crossbite on the left posterior side and anteriorly on the left side. She has 0 vertical overbite. Maximal incisal opening is 56 mm. Excursive movement to the right 9 mm, left 7 mm. There is an opening click at 15 mm with manipulation and a closing click about 15 mm all on the left side. Right side functions smoothly. Mild tenderness to palpation over the left masseter, left medial pterygoid, left styloid area and moderate discomfort over the left TMJ.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of the lower third molars but present impacted maxillary third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Right condylar head and neck appear elongated compared to the left side.

Waters view shows the sinuses are clear. Turbinates are enlarged particularly on the right side. She does have a nasal ring in position on the right side. The mandible is deviated off towards the left side.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology with a little flattening on the posterior head. Joint space looks fairly good. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ shows an elongated length of the condylar head and neck. Joint space appears a little bit decreased. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening there is some restricted translation on both joints.

B268 
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has some slight AP maxillary deficiency and perhaps some mandibular prognathism. There is a vertical difference in the heights of the inferior border of the mandible as well as the occlusal plane. Oral pharyngeal airway is somewhat constricted with the base of the tongue with dimension of about 5 mm, soft palate measures closer to 8 mm. Moderate high occlusal plane. A little bit elongated vertical length of the mandible. B268 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Right TMJ condylar hyperplasia versus osteochondroma. Right TMJ posterior displacement of the articular disc. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation.
Mandibular deviated prognathism off towards the left side. AP maxillary deficiency. Anterior vertical maxillary excess. Anterior crossbite and left posterior crossbite. Class III end-on occlusion on the right side. Impacted maxillary third molar x2. TMJ pain. Headaches. Earaches and tinnitus. Hypertrophied turbinates. Partial nasal airway obstruction.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Open up 1 mm of space between each maxillary lateral incisor and cuspid. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Continue to monitor facial growth and development. Surgery. Right TMJ high condylectomy and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to shift the mandible back onto the facial midline. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it, move it superiorly and correct the transverse arch discrepancy. Removal of impacted maxillary third molars. Bilateral partial nasal turbinectomies.

B268 MRI EVALUATION
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Joint space appears decreased. There appears to be discal tissue displaced medially and probably anteriorly.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears much larger in size and shape. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. The trabecular pattern appears a little bit different. It extends out to the lateral rim of the fossa. Difficult to tell where the discal tissue is.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with a little bit of flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. A little peaking of the condyle. Articular eminence has moderate inclination but somewhat elongated. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and appears to be sitting beneath the articular eminence. There appears to be some decreased superior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is significantly reduced translation of the left condyle and it appears to be in a closed lock situation.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have an elongated condylar head and neck. Articular eminence is moderately inclined. The articular disc is posteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space and actually at the base of the articular disc, which is posteriorly displaced. In the right joint, there is very minimal translation and the articular disc remains posteriorly displaced.

IMPRESSION: Right TMJ condylar hyperplasia with posteriorly displaced articular disc.
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with closed lock

B268  MRI EVALUATION
It is not labeled where I can read it so we will do side one first.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that out laterally has a little flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination to it. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence but anterior to the condyle. There may be slight decreased vertical joint space. There may be just a small osteophyte sticking off the top of the condyle. There is some fluid in superior joint space underneath the articular eminence. Open views show that there is restricted translation of the condyle. However, it appears that the articular disc does reduce.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have some arthritic changes particularly at the lateral aspect of the condyle where the top is flattened. More medial there is a little bit better shape but still some degenerative changes. Articular eminence has moderate inclination. It appears that there may be discal tissue posteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but particularly at the posterior aspect of the condylar neck near the base of the posterior band of the disc. Open views show virtually no translation of the condyle and the articular disc remains posteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle to have fairly good morphology mediolaterally. There appears to be slight decreased joint space. There is some discal tissue medial. There also appears to be discal tissue anterior. There is moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears fairly large. There appears to be significantly decreased joint space vertically. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim about 2 to 3 mm. It appears there may be discal tissue posterior to the condyle. Right condyle appears significantly larger than the left condyle.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction. Right TMJ enlarged condyle with articular disc posteriorly displaced.

The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient is about 5 days post surgery. Doing fairly well. Suctioned her nose today. Her occlusion is reasonably good. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She is in fairly good spirits. Getting her diet down well. She is progressing nicely and return to see me in one day.

B268 
B268 presents for followup evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Occlusion is good. I suctioned her nose and she had a lot of mucus and bloody materials in her nose and sinuses. She has a sore throat and examination shows that she has a buildup of yeast intraorally. I gave her prescription for Nystatin 100,000 units/mL, dispensing 200 mL, 1 teaspoon q.i.d., rinse mouth thoroughly, hold for 5 minutes, then swallow. I answered all the questions she and her mother had today. She is progressing well except for the yeast buildup. She is to return to see me in one day.

B268 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. Occlusion is fairly good, although not quite as well interdigitated on the left side. I took off the elastics on the right and just placed some relatively light vertical elastics on the left side and a light Class II elastic on the left side. Removed her sutures today. I suctioned her nose. Swelling is decreasing. The yeast infection is much improved, and she is feeling much better in regard to that. She is progressing nicely and to return to see me in one day.

B268 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient having some problems with nausea and constipation. She apparently threw up today on her way to the office. She popped off some more brackets. I clipped a wire removing some of the brackets on the left side, and I removed all of her elastics. Occlusion is actually reasonably good and because some of the brackets that have come lose, it may be better if we do not proceed with any elastics at this time, but wait until she gets back to the orthodontist and let him begin to finalize the occlusion. The nausea and the constipation could be related to the narcotics she is taking (hydrocodone) and the antibiotics. I told her to stop taking her antibiotics. She is to continue on with the Nystatin for one more day as her mouth appears to be clean at this time. I gave her a prescription for Ultram 50-mg tablets, dispensing 40 tablets, 1 tablet q.3 hours p.r.n. pain. Will see if this decreases her problems in both nausea and constipation. I also suggested that she try over-the-counter Dulcolax or a similar type medication to see if this would help her. She will try this. She has moderate swelling, but overall appears to be progressing satisfactory. I did suction her nose today and got a fair amount of mucus out of both sides of her nose. She is progressing satisfactorily and to return to see me in one day.

B268 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion is fairly good, but slightly open on the left side. I placed a vertical elastic on that side in the bicuspid area. I suctioned out her nose. She is progressing well and to return to see me in one day.

B268 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. I took off the current elastics and put a light Class II elastic on the left side. Did a note to her orthodontist. She can have her splint removed in mid-October. I drew directions on how to remove the splint. She is in good spirits. Did not need her nose suctioned today. Pain is under control. I gave her a prescription for Klonopin 1-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, one tablet q.h.s., refill x5, and gave her a prescription for Ultram 50, dispensing 50 tablets, 1 tablet q.4 to 6 hours p.r.n. pain, refill x1. She is doing well and to return to see me around Thanksgiving, and she is to call me if she has any concerns or problems.

B268 
Telephone conversation with B268 . B268 has been having a little bit of sinus problems on the left side. She went to see her doctor and the doctor put her on Augmentin as an antibiotic. She says the right side has cleared and she is getting some feeling back on the right side, but the left side of her face is still pretty numb. She has had some crackling in her joints as she has moved her jaws, and I told her this was normal and actually a good thing. She otherwise is progressing well and to keep me informed of her progress.

B268 
B268 presents for followup evaluation. She is doing reasonably well. Incisal opening is about 34 mm and excursion movements were about 1 or 2 mm in each direction. She is taking the following medications:

Klonopin 1 mg q.h.s.
Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.
Birth control pills.
Prozac 40 mg q.d.
Tramadol 50 mg p.r.n. pain.
Swelling is decreased. Occlusion looks very good. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. Palatal splint has been removed. There is one wire yet remaining around the maxillary left and submaxillary right cuspid that were removed today. Otherwise, she appears to be progressing well. I answered all the questions she and her mother had. She does feel like she has a sinus problem, but in her nasal airway I could not see any drainage and at the oropharyngeal airway I could not see any drainage. I will get some x-rays to evaluate that. We also removed the wire from the right maxillary cuspid. She is progressing nicely and to return to see me for a 1 year follow-up.

B268 
Telephone conversation with her. She says has a little bump up in the vestibule of the upper jaw around the canine area. She felt it might be a bone plate. I told her that the bone plates are quite high, so it would be very unusual for that to happen. She states she got some brown strings out the other day so it very well could be the sutures coming out. She does not have a bad taste in her mouth and does not have any swelling, but does have a little bit of tenderness up in that area. It could be just the incision is a little bit tender for her. She is not running a temperature. She does have an appointment to see me in about a week and a half or so. Unless she develops any other significant problems, we will wait until her appointment and see her then.

B268 
B268 presents for followup evaluation. She is now about almost 11 months post surgery. Doing fairly well. She rates her TMJ pain at about a level of 2, average daily pain at 5 but this is mainly in the shoulders and in the neck area. She rates her jaw function at 2, diet at 0, disability at 0. She gets headaches about 2 days a week in the frontal and temporal areas, but feels this may be related to nocturnal clenching. Incisal opening is 45 mm and excursion movements are about 3 mm in each direction. Occlusion looks good and stable. To palpation, she had some moderate tenderness over the left masseter muscle. Joints seem to function smoothly. She currently takes birth control pills and Prozac 40 mg q.d. She gets some earaches on the left side greater than the right side, but no tinnitus but occasional vertigo, and she does have some decreased hearing. Other joints that bother her include her left shoulder, hips, and knees. She is aware of nocturnal clenching.

I suggested that she go back on Klonopin, but she does not like that medication. Therefore, we will try Flexeril first, so I gave her a prescription for Flexeril 10 mg, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x5. Otherwise, she appears to be progressing nicely. X-rays look good. She has some decreased sensation to the lower left lip and chin area, but hopefully this will continue to improve for her. She is doing well and to return to see me in 2 years.
