B439 
B439 is 16 years old. B439 had previously broken his wrist and had some surgery on it. He currently takes Zyrtec and Concerta 27 mg t.i.d. He has allergies to pollens, grasses, farm animals and trees.

B439 has had previous orthodontics by Dr. XXXX. He had 2 phases of treatment. Phase 1 involved the lining of the front teeth and then phase 2 involved 4 bicuspid distractions and aligning and leveling the arches.

PRIMARY CONCERNS
Jaw may appear retruded.
Midlines and teeth do not align real well.
Nasal airway obstruction. Predominately a mouth breather.
B439 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, headaches, TMJ pain or myofascial pain. He does have problems with his left wrist but that is due to previous trauma where he fractured it about 3 years ago. He had to have a second surgery to remove a cyst that developed over it and to realign it so it would heal properly. He is not aware of any clenching or bruxism. He is predominately a mouth breather particularly at night when he sleeps as observed from his parents. Apparently, he does not have any significant snoring problems. B439 does not report any daytime somnolence.

In frontal view, B439 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 6 mm. Maxillary dental midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. Nasal tip may be just a touch off to the right side. Mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm off to the left. Mandibular dental midline and chin are fairly well aligned with each other. B439 does have a head postured forward neck position. He has an obtuse nasolabial angle. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably about 3 mm. Maxilla is AP deficient by probably at least 6 mm. Chin is deficient by 20 mm plus. Chin-neckline is extremely short; however, chin-neck angle is not well defined. He has lip incompetence of probably about 8 mm. Intraorally, B439 is missing upper and lower first bicuspids. All other teeth are present. He has some calculous and debris around his lower anterior teeth and a little inflammation around his gingiva. B439 has a 3x3 retainer in the lower anterior arch. He has a Class II end-on occlusion on the left side by probably 3 mm or so. On the right side it is pretty much a Class II. He has a vertical overbite of about 2 mm. B439 has huge tonsils that are hyperplastic. They do seem to fill up the majority of the oropharyngeal airway. It may be contributing to the obstructive airway problems. Intranasally, the nasoseptum is deviated off towards the left side. Turbinates are hyperplastic of at least a moderate to severe nature. There is moderate to severe nasal airway obstruction. The columella is not particularly wide and the nostrils are relatively normal in width. The luminal valves appear relatively normal. To palpation, B439 has no tenderness around the head and neck area. TMJs function smoothly. Incisal opening is 42 mm. Excursive movement to the right 6 mm, to the left 7 mm.



RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of all 4 third molars that are developing but impacted. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear large. Condyles appear a little bit short and stubby. There is a 3x3 retainer in the lower arch.

Waters view shows that there is a significant bony nasoseptal deviation off to the left side with bony spur extending off towards the left side. Turbinates appear moderately large compared to the transverse nasal width. The sinuses, however, appear relatively clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology although it does look a little bit short in vertical length. It is difficult to evaluate the cortical bone in the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit smaller in size as compared to the right side. It appears a little flat on top and a little sclerotic on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle with there being a little bit greater translation on the right side as compared to the left side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows the following concerns:
Huge adenoid mass in the nasopharynx that appears to touch against the turbinates probably creating a major nasal airway obstruction. Severely decrease oropharyngeal airway particularly adjacent to the adenoid mass, soft palate and posterior pharyngeal wall area.
High occlusal plane angle.
Skeletal Class II relationship.
Turbinates extending beyond the hard palate.

Dental model analysis: The maxillary right cuspid is about 1 mm posterior to the left cuspid and in the lower arch the left cuspid is about 1 to 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid creating arch asymmetries. Transversely, the maxillary right cuspid is almost 2 mm lower than the left cuspid. The lower arch is a little bit more symmetric transversely.

BASIC DIAGNOSES
Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
AP maxillary deficiency.
AP microgenia.
Vertical mandibular excess.
AP mandibular deficiency. Rule out TMJ pathology.
High occlusal plane angle.
Class II end-on occlusion on the left side, Class I on the right side.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Deviated nasoseptum.

B439 MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The lateral pole of the condyle extends on and slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. Articular disc is medially displaced and there is decreased joint space between the lateral rim of the fossa and the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The lateral pole of the condyle extends slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa has a moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim. Articular disc is medially displaced with a decreased joint space at the lateral rim of the fossa and head of the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology but there is some anterior beaking particularly towards the medial side of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be in position though not seen very well at the lateral extent of the fossa that correlates with medial displacement. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. It is actually steeper than the opposite side. At one area it appears to be almost vertical in relation to the horizontal plane. However, the articular disc appears to be in position although not seen as well at the lateral aspect of the joint compatible with medial displacement. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc with them in good position relative to each other.

IMPRESSION
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc medially displaced. Right TMJ mild arthritis and medial displacement of the articular disc.

Large nasopharyngeal adenoid mass.
Significant nasal airway obstruction, Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Missing 4 bicuspids due to previous orthodontics.
Impacted third molars x4.
Mandibular asymmetry with the left cuspid being posterior to the right cuspid by 1 to 2 mm. Maxillary arch asymmetry with the right cuspid being 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. Transverse cant in the maxillary occlusion with the right side being 2 mm lower than the left side.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
MRI of left and right TMJ. Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch. Use Class II elastics on the left side and Class III elastics on the right side to try and improve upper and lower arch dental symmetry. Surgery.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward approximately 6 to 8 mm, level it transversely, and level the AP occlusal plane.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasoseptoplasty.
Nasopharyngeal adenoidectomy.
Bilateral tonsillectomy. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
HTR implant anterior mandible.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

I did discuss with B439 and his family the potential risks and complications with the surgery. I also discussed potential growth factors. If we do the surgery early particularly since B439 is a little bit delayed developmentally, there is the possible issue of having disproportionate growth between the maxilla and mandible that could require additional surgery at a later time following completion of his growth. However, with his current growth pattern being downwards and backwards, these patients tend to grow more harmoniously as compared to maxilla in a normal or deficient growth position. They understand this.
