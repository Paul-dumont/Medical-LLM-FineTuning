B035
B035 is 22 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. She has had previous surgery including jaws, septoplasty, adenoids, and a forehead lift. The only medication she takes is Clarinex. Primary concerns that B035 has include the following:

Severe cant of the upper and lower jaw involving the chin, teeth, mouth, lips, nose, midlines.
Elongated face from the eyes to the mouth.
Pain in the jaw joints. Popping and cracking in the jaw joints.

B035 had an accident at about the age of 6 and had trauma to the right side of the face. She had orthodontics and also a splint to the jaws that was placed on the lower jaw. She had jaw surgery 11 years ago and also 4 years ago.

She rates her headaches at a level of 3 that occur predominantly in the forehead, temple, and behind the eyes. She rates her TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 4. She rates her jaw function at 4, her diet at 1, and disability at 6. She does have some mild snoring, but apparently no nasal airway obstruction. She is mildly tired during the day, but does not claim to have any sleep apnea. Previous surgeries for her airway included removal of her adenoids and a septoplasty.

B035 is aware of clenching and grinding her teeth at teeth. She gets occasional earaches and tinnitus. She had her adenoidectomy done 3 years ago and last year had the rhinoplasty, septoplasty, and brow lift performed. She had orthodontics from 11 years old to 19 years old for approximately 8 years. Her double jaw surgery was actually performed on two years and nine months ago. B035's surgery was performed by Dr. XXXX. Looking at the photos after the surgery compared to current situation, it appears that her facial asymmetry has continued to get progressively worse.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B035 has fairly good balance in the middle and upper third fact. She does have asymmetry in the lower third face. Lower lip length is about 21 mm. Lower tooth lip is about 2.5 to 3 mm. The maxillary dental midline is about 1 to 2 mm off to the left side. The mandibular dental midline is probably 2 to 3 mm off to the left side and chin is about 8 mm off to the left side. Lower dental midline and chin midline are fairly well aligned with each other. When B035 shifts her mandible towards the right side a full tooth width, then her chin is fairly well aligned on the facial midline. Nasal tip is slightly to the right 1 to 2 mm. and chin midline are all pretty much aligned to the facial midline. In profile, the upper lip has a C-shaped curve, and there appears to be some AP deficiency in the superior aspect of the upper lip of probably about 3 to 4 mm. Upper lip in the vermilion area is somewhat full. Nasal tip is turned up some and she has an obtuse nasolabial angle. The mandible appears to be retruded probably at least 10 to 12 mm, and chin neckline is short, though chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. B035 states that she did have some cheek implants placed bilaterally, but they got infected and were removed shortly after surgery. Intraorally, B035 has a good Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has about a 2 mm anterior open bite. She appears to have good attached gingiva. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 3 mm higher than the right side in the cuspid area. B035 has a yaw in the posterior maxilla and mandible with them being shifted off towards the right side probably about 3 mm. She has significantly more fullness in the right mandible and angle as compared to the left side. There must be at least 3 to 4 mm. As B035 shifts her mandible towards the right side to improve the overall facial symmetry, her left ramus is more prominent than the right side. On closing, she has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship and 2 mm vertical overbite anteriorly. She has an open bite in the second molar area on the right side. Intranasally, the left turbinate is moderately enlarged and the right one is relatively normal. She may have some mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction on the left side, but the right side appears open. To palpation, B035 has some moderate tenderness over the TMJs and mild tenderness over the masseter muscles. Jaws seem to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is 41 mm and about 35 mm without discomfort. Excursion movement is to the right 6 mm and to the left 5 mm.

Panorex shows the presence of 2 bone plates inside the mandibular ramus body with 4 screws in each plate. In the maxilla, there are anterior and posterior bone plates present. In the upper arch, it appears that the second bicuspids may have been extracted. The third molars are present in the upper arch. In the lower arch, the third molars are absent. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Left condyle appears arthritic and quite small with loss of vertical and anteroposterior volume. Right condyle appears larger than normal.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite small with loss of vertical and AP volume. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. Condyle is sclerotic. There is decreased posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderate in size.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condylar head and neck that appears elongated and significantly thicker than the opposite side. There is decreased vertical joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant degenerative changes with a lot of sclerosis and a pseudocyst towards the medial side of the condyle. There is decreased vertical and lateral joint space. The condyle is small compared to the width of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite large and fills essentially the entire joint space. There is decreased vertical joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly fairly significantly and demonstrates significant loss of joint space. Vertical height of the condylar head appears greater than normal.

Coronal view of the jaws shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates appear quite large and may create some significant nasal airway obstruction. Axial views concur with the large turbinates, although the sinuses are clear.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is a vertical discrepancy at the inferior border as well as at the occlusal surface. She appears to have a moderate high occlusal plane angle yet. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the soft palate measures about 6 mm and at the base of the tongue measures about 8 mm. Basic diagnoses would be as follows:

Left TMJ severe resorptive arthritis and articular disc dislocated with significant deformation and nonsalvageable. Right TMJ condylar hyperplasia versus osteoma with medial displacement of the articular disc. Mandibular AP hypoplasia and asymmetry. Maxillary AP hypoplasia, posterior vertical hypoplasia, and asymmetry. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 3 mm shorter than the right side in the cuspid area.
Maxilla and mandible shifted off towards the left side.
Maxillary midline shifted to the left about 2 mm, mandibular dental midline shifted to the left 3 mm, and chin shifted to the left approximately 8 mm. Generalized severe root resorption being somewhat worse in the maxilla than the mandible.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Nasal airway obstruction. External nasal deformity.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Place appliances on the maxillary and mandibular arch. Try to get to a reasonably strong arch wire. Minimize orthodontic movements because of extremely short roots. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with correction of the asymmetry using TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, level it transversely, and down-graft it posteriorly, greater on the left side as compared to the right side. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Bilateral coronoidotomies.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B035 MRI AGE: 22/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is severely arthritic and has lost significant volume. There is decreased vertical joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Condyle is quite flat across the top and appears sclerotic.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears enlarged and appears to have a medial extension of the condylar head. There is decreased vertical joint space. The disc may be anteriorly and medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears quite small with loss of vertical and anteroposterior dimension. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc has undergone significant degenerative and morphological changes. Posterior band is extremely thick. Intermediate zone is simply minimized. There is decreased posterior joint space. There appears to be some compressed tissue within the confines of the fossa between the condyle and the fossa. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle and the articular eminence remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condylar head and neck that is elongated. There is decreased superior joint space. Out laterally, the joint space is quite narrow. Medially, it appears that the disc may be in position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space, but not too much. The excess length of the condylar head and neck would be compatible with a condylar hyperplasia or osteoma. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle and the articular eminence appears to be in a reduced position at the cuts provided. The articular eminence is relatively shallow on this side.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ advanced arthritis and articular disc dislocated with significant deformation and nonreducing. Right TMJ possible condylar hyperplasia/osteoma with articular disc medially displaced.
