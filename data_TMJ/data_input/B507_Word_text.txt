B507
B507 is 13 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX.
Patient Concerns
B507's concerns are primarily as follows:
His jaws and teeth are not properly lined up.
Difficulties eating some foods.
Primarily mouth breather.
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Vertigo that occurs about every three days.
Occasional ringing in the ears.

Patient History
B507 rates his headaches that occur primarily in the right posterior head area at about a level of 5 and also can occur in the temporal areas at the same level, TMJ pain at 2, overall pain at 1 on a daily basis, jaw function at 5, diet at 3. He does not appear to have any neurological deficits.

B507's problems began at the age of 3 years when he was involved in a motor vehicle accident and apparently hit the dashboard even though he was wearing his seatbelt. He sustained multiple midfacial fractures and probably a midline symphysis fracture. He also had a fractured femur.

He has had a number of surgeries:
To fix the facial fractures and place bone plates.
Tonsil removal because he developed significant airway problems after the injuries.
Removal of some of the bony hardware.
Tubes in the ears.
Tubes in the eyelids for lacrimal drainage.

B507 does have a hearing loss of about 10% to 20%.
Clinical Evaluation
In frontal view, B507's intercanthal distance is about 33 mm and interpupillary distance about 58 mm. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about -3. Mandibular dental midline and chin are pretty much on the facial midline. Maxillary dental midline is about 7 mm off to the right.

In profile view, he does have some nasal ptosis present. A little deficiency perhaps in the nasal projection. Maxilla may be 3 to 4 mm AP deficient. Has a very acute nasolabial angle. Overall length of nose appears a little bit short. If upper lip is pulled down a little bit, it does improve the nasolabial angle. Some of the nasal deformity may be due to damage to the septum and vomer. Chin appears a little bit AP deficient, although lower lip is fairly prominent. Chin-neckline is fairly long but not well defined. Some fullness in the submental area.

Intraorally, he has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars present. In the upper arch, upper right cuspid is not visualized, but the rest of his teeth are present back through the first molar. On the left side, he appears to have all of his teeth back through the first molar. He has a Class III occlusal relationship and essentially and open bite extending from the right all the way around to the left first molar. All other teeth are out of occlusion. Lower teeth are fairly well aligned, and he has adequate attached gingiva. Has an open bite of approximately 4 mm anteriorly. He has a reverse over bite of probably almost 10 mm. He has a total crossbite involving all the teeth except for the right first molars. Oropharynx appears relatively normal. He has some mild transverse narrowness between the posterior faucial pillars. Uvula is relatively normal in size. Appears to be adequate room anteroposteriorly from the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall.

Intranasally, his septum is posteriorly deviated off to the right side and anterior half to two thirds is deviated significantly off to the left side with a relatively large spur at the base of the septum. Turbinate on the right side is moderately enlarged and on the left is difficult to see because of the severe deviation of the nasal septum but may also be somewhat enlarged. This probably accounts for the difficulties breathing through his nose. The nostrils are short in vertical height but are somewhat broad. To palpation, B507 has no tenderness all around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is about 38 mm, and excursive movements were less than a millimeter in each direction, but this could have been a perceptual factor.

Of interest is when B507 wears shoes, he walks pretty much normally. With his shoes off, he walks only on his toes and doesn't put his heels down. The etiology of this is unknown at this time. This apparently has developed since the accident.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the presence of impacted mandibular third molars. Root on the mandibular right central incisor is extremely short probably related to the symphyseal fracture that occurred there most likely. In the upper arch, he has an impacted maxillary right cuspid, and it looks as though there are some bone screws that probably go into it that prevented it from erupting. It is completely above the root apices of the rest of the maxillary teeth. On the right side, the second molar appears to be fairly well developed but may be ankylosed, and there is a large amount of opaque tissue around that third molar possibly due to an enamel organ that over-proliferated. Third molar is not very visible on this side, although it could be in one of the more radiopaque spots above the apex of the second molar. On the right side, there is some kind of condensing form of tooth development just posterior to the second molar but no formable second or third molar teeth have developed. Nasal septum is deviated off to the left side. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. Anatomy of the coronoid areas seems a little bit unusual. Left joint appears to have some extra bone in the area.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle and fossa that actually look reasonably good. Joint space looks fairly good. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space actually looks slightly increased vertically. The developing second molar can be seen with the condensing osteitis around the root of it. It is probably an ankylosed tooth. Whether the third molars positioned directly above the second molars roots is difficult to ascertain. Lower third molar is impacted.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be postured a little bit forward in the fossa. There may be an anterior exophytic development off the condylar head that comes out onto the articular eminence. Joint space otherwise looks pretty good except the bone appears to grow off anteriorly from th condylar head and is in close approximation to the articular eminence. Articular eminence is quite shallow on this side. The developing rudimentary dental structure in the second molar area is seen, and the impacted mandibular third molar is observed.

Open view shows very little transitory abilities in the jaw structures. In the right joint, it looks like there may be some kind of ossifying material coming down off the articular eminence.

Waters view shows multiple bone plates around the orbits. Left orbit is much larger than the right orbits. Nasal septal deviation is observed. Turbinates appear quite large particularly on the left side. May be some vertical asymmetry in the lower jaw with the right side being vertically slightly longer than the left side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows significant AP deficiency of the maxilla. Mandible appears to be relatively normal in development. Lower incisors are somewhat flared forward. Bony chin projection is somewhat decreased. The presence of the bone plates is seen. The hypoplasia in the nasal frontal areas is observed as well as the AP and vertical insufficiencies of the maxilla. Oropharyngeal airway is quite constricted with the distance from the base of the tongue to the posterior pharyngeal wall being only about 3 mm. At the soft palate level, it measures 4 mm. At the posterior nasopharyngeal area, it measures about 4 to 5 mm. He does have some adenoid tissue in the posterior nasopharyngeal area that is causing significant constricture of the airway there. Between the adenoid mass and the turbinate, there is only about 1 mm. He has significant airway obstruction in the nasal and oropharyngeal areas.

Dental models reveal that he is missing the maxillary right cuspid, which is impacted with bone screws in it up around the orbital rim area. There is moderate crowding upper anterior arch and very minimal crowding, lower anterior arch. Using the right first bicuspid as a cuspid, there is probably AP arch asymmetry of probable 5 to 6 mm. Lower arch looks fairly symmetric anteroposteriorly.

Nasal septoplasty.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
Nasopharyngeal adenoidectomy.
Surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars, maxillary right second molar, and complex odontoma as well as rudimentary tooth structure in the left maxillary second molar area.
Removal of bone plates from right infraorbital rim and left maxillary area.

Postsurgical orthodontics to re fine occlusion
Secondary surgical procedures as necessary to finalize his treatment
B507 MRI Evaluation

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that does have some abnormal shape to it. There appears to be some significant medial beaking present. Outline of the fossa is difficult to identify. Some abnormal bone factors present on the medial aspect of the fossa. There appear to be some bumps with medullary bone within. The top of the condyle looks somewhat arthritic. Difficult to identify any discal tissue.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. However, decreased lateral joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves downward a fairly significant amount. Difficult to identify any discal tissue. There appears to be somewhat of an exophytic protuberance of the condyle out laterally.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is really deformed and has a significant anterior exophytic development off the top of it. It stands out beyond the articular eminence. Articular eminence is really short in vertical height and is not well shaped. Cortical bone is very thin over the functional surface. Significantly decreased joint space is present and almost nonexistent. No evidence of any discal tissue is observed. T2 shows some dense cortical bone throughout the head of the condyle.

Opening views show no translation of the condyle whatsoever indicative of severe adhesions present.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with better morphology. There appears to be some discal tissue present in the fossa but somewhat posteriorly displaced. However, this could possibly be some bony formation. No particular inflammatory response seen but appears to be some soft tissue between what appears to be the disc and the fossa. This may, in fact, but bone formation instead of discal tissue. Articular eminence is moderately steep but appears somewhat degenerated. Cortical bone is very thin over it.

There is no more than 1 or 2 m of translation of the condyle on opening indicative of severe adhesion formation within the joints.
Impression:
Left TMJ severe arthritis with large exophytic mass protruding anteriorly and no evidence of the presence of a disc and probable significant adhesions.
Right TMJ arthritic changes and articular disc very difficult to identify with severe limiting adhesions within the joint.
