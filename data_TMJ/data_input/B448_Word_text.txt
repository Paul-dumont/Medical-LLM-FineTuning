B448
B448 is 23 years old and referred by a former patient, XXXX. Primary concerns that B448 has are as follows:

His teeth do not touch.
Constant tooth and jaw pain.
Headaches. Locking. Popping in the joints. He does have some difficulties eating and chewing.
He does have a lot of congestion and times has difficulties breathing through his nose and becomes a more prominent mouth breather.

He takes no medications.
He became aware of having jaw problems at about the age of 11 when he was told to see an orthodontist. The etiology is unknown. He has had headaches at least beginning in high school and throughout high school and college. He underwent orthodontics from the age of 11 to 14 by Dr. XXXX. He has essentially had no other treatment for his jaw problems.

B448 rates his TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 6, headaches at 7 that occur predominantly in the frontal and temporal area bilaterally. He rates his jaw function at 5, diet at 3, disability at 2. He gets occasional earaches with the left side worse than the right side and moderate occurrence of tinnitus. He also has a moderate occurrence of vertigo, but has no hearing loss. He has some noisy joints and they are particularly in his wrists and through motion have a lot of crackling sounds. His hands and fingers hurt sometimes. He also has some problems with his neck. He is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime and also during the daytime.

In frontal view, B448 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular midline is about 3.5 mm off to the left side as is the chin. In profile view, the maxilla is posteriorly positioned at least 6 mm. The chin is back probably around 4 to 5 mm. The chin neckline is a little bit short and chin neck angle is not defined. Intraorally, B448 has all of his lower teeth back to the second molars. He has a wide mandibular arch and the first molars actually have an excessive buccal inclination. He has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has fairly wide arches. He has huge tonsils. This constricts the fascial pillars. Otherwise, the uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal. B448 does appear to have some macroglossia. The nasal septum may be deviated a little bit off towards the right side and at the bottom there is an osteophyte kind of formation that extends into the left side of the nose. The turbinates appear moderate in size. B448 has anterior and bilateral posterior cross bites. The cross bite is a little bit worse on the left side than the right side. He has a full Class III occlusion on the right side and on the left side he has an end-on Class III by about 3 mm. The mandibular left cuspid is about 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, the right cuspid may be 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. He has a reverse deep bite of about 2 mm and a reverse over jet of -6 mm. To palpation, he has moderate pain in the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, styloid areas and milder tenderness over the right shoulder. Joints function relatively smoothly, but he does feel slight crepitus in his joints. The maximal incisal opening is just 58 mm, excursion movement to the right 4 mm, to the left about 3 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and B448 says that they never formed. He has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch. He has some relatively short roots on the bicuspids in the upper arch and slightly elongated condylar heads and necks.

Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear. He has some deviation of the nasal septum. The right turbinate is quite large and appears to contribute significantly to nasal airway obstruction on that side. On the left side, the turbinate is more normal. Sinuses are clear except there is a little thickening of the sinus membrane along the right lateral sinus wall.

Axial view does show that the right turbinate is enlarged and appears to block most of the functional airway.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Medially, the condyle is more anteriorly positioned in the fossa and there is a decreased joint space posteriorly. The articular eminence is relatively shallow.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows that medially the condyle is more anteriorly positioned in the fossa and out laterally as well and posteriorly positioned, however, there is slightly greater joint space behind the right condyle out at the lateral aspect of the joints compared to the left side.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is some decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There is decreased lateral joint space and the lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has huge tonsils that appear to displace the tongue forward and may be part of the reason that the tongue appears relatively large for the oral cavity. The posterior base of the tongue is completely supported forward by the tonsils. Oropharyngeal airway between the base of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall is about 14 mm, but at the soft palate level is only 5 mm. This again in part could be due to the extremely large tonsils. He does have a skeletal and occlusal Class III relationship with about a 2 mm reverse deep bite.

B448 has had a fairly consistent cough for about the last 6 to 7 years. His jaw growth is getting progressively worse.
Basic diagnoses would be as follows:

Bilateral TMJ condylar hyperplasia (evaluate if it is active or inactive growth).
Mandibular deviated prognathism.
Maxillary AP and transverse hypoplasia.
Full Class III occlusion on the right side, Class III end-on on the left side. Anterior and bilateral posterior cross bites.
Hypertrophied right turbinate. Severely hypertrophied tonsils.
Relative macroglossia secondary to displacement related to the hypertrophied tonsils.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 3 mm.
Slight arch asymmetry with mandibular left cuspid being about 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid and maxillary right cuspid being 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid.
Sleep apnea symptoms. Buccal tipping particularly of the mandibular first molars.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Removal of hypertrophied tonsils.
2.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Try to tip the first molars lingually to align them more appropriately with the rest of the mandibular teeth.
3.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Possible high condylectomies to arrest growth if confirmed active condylar hyperplasia is still occurring. c.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to rotate the mandible back on the facial midline. d.	Maxillary osteotomies to advance and expand. e.	Right partial inferior turbinectomy.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B448 MRI
DOB:
DATE OF ACQUISITION:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. The disc appears to be medially positioned with the lateral third of the condyle uncovered. There is decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. The disc likewise is medially displaced leaving the lateral third uncovered. There is decreased joint space towards the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim curves inferiorly probably about 3 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology, although the condylar head and neck appear elongated. The disc appears to be in reasonably good position anteroposteriorly. Out laterally, the disc is not as easily seen. In some of the views, it appears that the disc may be posteriorly displaced. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. There is significant amount of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces anterior to the condyle. This may show that the condylar disc is actually in fairly good AP position. On opening, the left TMJ has some restricted translation with the condyle only coming forward just a few millimeters. The disc does not move much. In the cine films, it appears that the disc is posteriorly displaced and then on opening it appears to jump forward into a more normal position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. The condylar head and neck appear elongated. The disc may be slightly posteriorly positioned. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination to it. There is no fluid within the joint space. The disc appears to be posteriorly position. In the opening views, the disc appears to be in fairly good position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. There is very minimal translation.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ medial displacement of the articular disc and limited translation of both condyle and disc.
Right TMJ posteromedial displacement of the articular disc and on opening there is significant restriction of movement.
