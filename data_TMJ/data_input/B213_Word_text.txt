B213
B213 is 14 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX.
Patient History
She has had orthodontics by Dr. XXXX. B213 has had a maxillary expansion device but no other orthodontic treatment yet. B213 has had some tubes in her ears, but no other surgery. She has an allergy to CODEINE. Otherwise, she is in good health. B213's TMJ problems began about 7 months ago of unknown etiology. She first became aware of it when she was eating pizza. Three months ago, she received a bite plate, and this helped her initially, but then it made her jaws get worse, so she is discontinuing wearing it. She gets earaches on the right side but no tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She does have an allergy to codeine and perhaps to MILK as her stomach bothers her quite a bit after she has milk. She cannot wear cheap jewelry including necklaces or earrings. She is not bothered by cheap bracelets. She does clench and brux at night. She has had to stop choir because of pain and difficulties opening. She used to be involved in music competitions but has had to drop out of that. She is a cheerleader and also is in gymnastics.

She rarely gets headaches. However, she rates her TMJ pain, which is predominantly on the right side, at a level of 6 on an average day, but it easily can escalate up to a level of 8. Average daily pain would be about a 6. She rates her jaw function at 6, diet at 4, and disability at a level of 3. She is in competitive horse riding, and the jaw problems have not interfered significantly with that activity. It has, however, caused her to drop out of choir. Her cheerleading and gymnastics are bothered some by it, but she is able to continue to perform there.

Current Medications
1. Tretenion, which is a facial cream for a skin condition
2. Vitamins
3. She will occasionally take Advil for discomfort, but this is infrequent

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, she has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 6 mm. Maxillary, mandibular, and chin midlines are pretty much on the facial midline. Left eye might be just 1 to 2 mm higher than the right.

In profile view, she has an obtuse nasolabial angle. Actually may be AP deficient by probably about 3 to 4 mm. Mandible is probably AP deficient by probably about 5 or 6 mm. Chin-neckline is a little bit short, but chin-neck angle is well-defined.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Some moderate crowding, lower anterior arch. Appears to have adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. IN the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through her first molars erupted in and doesn't have her second molars in yet. She has an anterior deep bite of about 6 mm. Fairly close to being Class I cuspid relationship. Intraorally, the oropharynx does appear clear. She has a bifid uvula.

Intranasally, she has moderately enlarged turbinates but appears to have adequate airway for the most part.
To palpation, she has moderate pain over the right masseter and mild pain over the right TMJ. Maximal incisal opening including overbite is 44 mm and 39 mm without significant pain. Excursive movement to the right is 9 mm and to left 6 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the presence of unerupted maxillary second molars and developing maxillary third molars bilaterally. In the lower arch, she has developing mandibular third molars, and she has unerupted mandibular left second bicuspid with a primary E still retained, although the roots are resorbing and the tooth appears that it is progressing toward eruption. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Difficult to assess the condyles exposed.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates appear larger on this view particularly on the right side.
Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with a little flattening on the superior head. A little anterior beaking appears to be developing and a little posterior peaking appears to be developing. Joint space appears fairly well balanced although just slightly decreased posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Some very minor anterior beaking. Joint space looks fairly well-balanced. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space appears less on the left side as compared to on the right side in a vertical and anterior direction as well as posterior, but this may be due in part to the splint therapy.

On opening, there is better translation on the left side than the right side. Right condyle appears to be a little more flattened on the anterior articulating surface.

Cephalometrically, she appears to have a skeletal Class I occlusion with some vertical maxillary excess with both the maxilla and mandible being slightly posteriorly positioned. Oropharyngeal airway appears adequate. Turbinates do extend fairly significantly posterior to the posterior aspect of the maxilla by probably a good 5 to 6 mm. She does exhibit some lip incompetence.

There is a tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm.
Basic Diagnoses
1. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction
2. Possible left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation (MRI of poor quality)
3. Vertical maxillary excess
4. AP maxillary deficiency
5. AP mandibular deficiency
6. Anterior deep bite of 5 to 6 mm
7. Crowding, lower anterior arch
8. Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm
9. Right TMJ pain
10. Right-sided myofascial pain
11. Retained mandibular left primary E but with a permanent successor beneath it
12. Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars
13. Unerupted maxillary left and right second molars
14. Moderately hypertrophied turbinates
15. Partial nasal airway obstruction

Treatment options include the following:
1. Redo MRI of left and right TMJs
2. Extract mandibular left primary molar
3. Presurgical orthodontics A. Align and level maxillary arch B. Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 2 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth-size discrepancy and also to keep from flaring the lower incisors any further forward
4. Surgery Treatment Option #1 A. Unilateral or bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair depending on MRI findings B. Unilateral or bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies depending on whether one or both joints need to be operated C. Removal of four bony impacted third molars

Treatment Option #2 A. Unilateral or bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair depending on MRI findings B. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly and advance it C. Unilateral or bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies depending on whether one or both joints need to be operated D. Removal of four bony impacted third molars E. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies
5. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion

MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of Reading:
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Appears to be some decreased vertical joint space. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Articular disc appears may be medially displaced. Difficult to tell if the cortical bone is all intact on these views.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Appear to be some erosion in the head of the condyle. Appears to be decreased vertical joint space. Difficult to tell where the disc is but may be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is difficult to tell if the cortical bone is intact or not. Difficult to tell where the top of the condyle is. It is difficult to tell where the disc is. In the T2 films, it appears that the disc is in a fairly normal position, but the details of the disc are hard to identify. Condyle does appear to be a little bit posteriorly positioned in the fossa but difficult to tell because of the angle at which the MRIs were taken. No open views are available.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is flattening on the anterior head. Appears to be an osteophyte on the superior aspect of the condylar head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced. Posterior band appears to be somewhat thickened. Disc is sitting beneath the articular eminence. Difficult to tell if the cortical bone is intact on the condyle with these views.

Impression:
1. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with probably no reduction when correlated to the clinical impression
2. Left TMJ unable to interpret

MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of Reading:
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with wide mediolateral dimension. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Decreased vertical and lateral joint space. Articular disc is seen to be medially displaced and anteriorly displaced. Lateral pole of the condyle appears to extend out even or slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width although not quite as wide as the opposite side. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Joint space is better on this side vertically. Condyle fits within the lateral rim of the fossa. Difficult to identify the discal tissue, although in one view it appears to be in position but perhaps laterally displaced.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. One little area shows some anterior beaking. Do not see much disc toward the lateral aspect of the joint. What does come into view seems to be just a little bit anteriorly displaced; however, more toward the medial side the disc appears to be in good position. Articular eminence is moderately steep and moderately long in length. No particular inflammatory response within this joint.

On opening, there appears to be some restricted translation of the condyle, but the disc is probably in reasonable position in the open view.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some flattening on the superior head and actual skipping out of the anterior head toward the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Cortical bone is not quite as nicely identified on the slope of the eminence. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced, somewhat foreshortened, and somewhat thickened. Joint space may be a little bit decreased posteriorly. May be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle but difficult to tell if the disc reduces or not.
Impression:
1. Left TMJ medially displaced articular disc with some slight anterior displacement out laterally
2. Right TMJ arthritis with loss of bony volume that could be compatible with idiopathic condylar resorption
