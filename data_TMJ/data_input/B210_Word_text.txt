B210
B210 is 31 years old and is a self referral. B210 has had problems with headaches since about the age of 10. It is known if those were teenage or TMJ related. She has had clicking and popping in her jaw joints as long as she can remember. However, it was not until she got her teeth cleaned one year and five months ago that she began developing the severe TMJ pain problems and the increased severity of her headaches. The etiology of her joint problems are unknown.

She has had previous orthodontics from 16 to 18 years old. She received a splint one year and five months ago and wears that presently. This is made by Dr. XXXX. B210 rates her headaches at a level of 10 that occur predominantly on the left side in the frontal and temporal area, but then bilaterally in the posterior head and neck area and on top of the head. She rates her TMJ pain at 10, which is a severity that it reaches every day. Her average daily pain is 6. She rates her jaw function and diet at 0, disability at 5.

B210 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, but gets occasional vertigo but has no hearing loss. The other joints that bother her are her knees. She is aware of clenching at nighttime. The only medication she currently takes is Pristiq 100 mg q.h.s.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B210 has good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile, B210 has good facial balance and symmetry. Intraorally, B210 has all of her lower teeth back through the third molars. She has some mild crowding of the anterior arch. She has some lack of good quality attached gingiva around the lower central incisors. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the third molars present. B210 has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship and about a 3 mm anterior deep bite. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. She has no nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, B210 has high moderate pain over the TMJs, retromandibular area, and moderate pain over the SCMs, posterior neck, temporalis, and masseter muscles. On opening, she has clicking in both joints at about 10 mm of opening and almost less than 5 mm of closing. On excursion movements, she has clicking bilaterally. Maximal incisal opening is 46 mm but only 25 mm without pain. She has excursion movements to the right of 7 mm and to the left of 7 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of all the teeth including the third molars erupted and in position. Nasal airway looks open. It is difficult to evaluate the joints in this x-ray. Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear and the turbinates are of moderate size. Septum is reasonably straight.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The turbinates of moderate size, but there appears to be good passable airway and septum appears reasonably straight. Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is fairly steep. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with an increased anterior joint space indicative of an anteriorly displaced disc. There is a decreased superoposterior joint space. Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with increased anterior joint space indicative of an anteriorly displaced disc. There is a decreased superoposterior joint space. Left TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle with good mediolateral width. There is a slight decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint, although vertically the joint space appears reasonably good. There is some increased prominence of the lateral pole of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Right TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space. The vertical joint space appears somewhat decreased in some of the views. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B210 has a skeletal Class I jaw relationship.

Dental models show that she has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. She has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. All the teeth are present back through the third molars.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis but articular discs anteriorly displaced with reduction. Severe TMJ pain. Severe headaches.
Myofascial pain. Relative mandibular hyperplasia.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain a Class I occlusion but create space within the joint for the articular discs. c. Application of arch bars.

B210 MRI AGE: 30/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm. Articular disc is seen and is displaced medially. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Lateral joint space is decreased compared to the middle and medial joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Articular disc is seen to be medially displaced. Lateral joint space is decreased compared to the middle and medial aspect.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology with a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately inclined. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint and, in fact, at the far lateral aspect of the joint, the disc is not seen compatible with medial displacement. More medially, the disc is in a more normal position. The shape of the fossa is not congruent with the shape of the condyle. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc and the disc appears to reduce early on.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little flattening on the posterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking present and some slight sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced at the lateral and middle aspect of the joint, but medially the disc appears to be in a little better position. Out laterally, the discal tissue is not seen indicative of medial displacement. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation and reduction of the disc.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anterior and medially displaced with early reduction. Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced with reduction on opening.
Right TMJ is worse than the left TMJ, but both discs appear salvageable. Indicated treatment appears to be bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
