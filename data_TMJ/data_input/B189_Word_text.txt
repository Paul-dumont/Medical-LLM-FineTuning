B189
B189 is 17 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX, ENT specialist. B189 had orthodontics from the age of 10 to 13 including two phases of treatment. She began developing headaches when she was 14 in the ninth grade of unknown etiology. She has had no treatment except for some physical therapy that was initiated about 5 weeks ago. The physical therapy has helped her with her headaches. When she has the physical therapy, the headache intensity decreases for about 3 days. She had sinus surgery in 3 years ago and she had her wisdom teeth removed 4 years ago.

She gets daily headaches at about a level of 6 in the frontal and temporal areas bilaterally. She rates her TMJ pain at 2, average daily pain at 4, jaw function at 2, diet at 1, disability at 1. She takes the following medications:
1. Synthroid 625 mcg per day.
2. Solodyn 90 mg q.d.
3. Singulair 10 mg q.d.
4. Nasonex p.r.n.

She gets earaches bilaterally, but no tinnitus or vertigo and has no hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She does have hypothyroidism, but takes the Synthroid for that. She does have a history of recurrent sinus infections and ear infections. She does have some GI issues as well. She has been to see a neurologist and has tried various medications, but nothing has been effective without putting her to sleep.

In frontal view, B189 has good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxilla, mandible, and chin midline are all fairly aligned with each other. In profile, she has good facial balance. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some crowding on the lower arch. She does have a 2 x 2 retainer in the lower arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has a 2-mm vertical overbite relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and normal. Intranasally, the septum may be a little bit deviated off towards the left side with a little deviation back towards the right at the base of the septum, but for the most part it is relatively straight. The turbinates appear just mildly enlarged, however, she does not have any significant nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the temporalis muscles, TMJs, and milder tenderness over the retromandibular area. Maximal opening is 55 mg and she could open to 28 without discomfort. Excursion movements are about 11 mm in each direction.

Basic diagnoses for B189 would be as follows:
1. Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs laterally displaced and slightly anteriorly at the lateral aspect of the joint.
2. Relatively mandibular hyperplasia.
3. Bilateral TMJ pain.
4. Bilateral headaches.
5. Myofascial pain.
6. Earaches.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Bilateral TMJ injections with Marcaine to evaluate effect on headaches.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain occlusion.

B189 MRI
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some degenerative changes with the presence of anterior beaking. The articular disc appears to be in position, but there appears to be a reactive pannus surrounding the disc. The disc could be slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. In the T2 films, there is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. The disc looks in a little bit better shape in these images. Right TMJ sagittal view shows more degenerative changes particularly towards the medial aspect of the joint where there is flattening of the head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. The disc is in reasonably good position, but again there appears to be a reactive pannus surrounding the disc. At the lateral aspect, the disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. The disc appears to be in better condition in the T2 films. The disc may be anteriorly displaced particularly at the lateral aspect.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Joint space appears fairly good. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a relatively minimal amount. It appears that there may be some disc tissue present. On the left side, the disc may be laterally displaced. Left dynamic opening shows that the disc appears to be in position and translates well with the condyle.

The right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width, although there may be some loss of vertical volume. Joint space looks reasonably good, although may be slightly decreased at the lateral aspect. The disc appears it might be laterally displaced. Right dynamic opening shows that the disc appears to be in position and translates well with the condyle.

IMPRESSION:
1. Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis being slightly worse on the right side and articular discs that appear to be laterally displaced and perhaps slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint.
2. Bilaterally, the discs reduce on opening.
