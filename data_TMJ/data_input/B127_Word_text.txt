B127
B127 is 14 years and 11 months of age. She was referred by a former patient, XXXX. Her orthodontist is Dr. XXXX.
She has a lot of problems with getting return illnesses and “she catches everything.” She in the past has had a lot of trouble with her ears and had ear tubes placed at ages 2, 4, 6, and 7. For the most part, she is in good health. She takes Accutane 40 mg q.d. She has had an adverse reaction to sulfa and codeine.

B127 gets headaches at about a level of 6 in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area. She has no particular pain in the TMJ area. She rates her jaw function at 4, diet at 5, disability at 4. She did have previous orthodontics at the age of 8 and apparently that was first stage treatment, but has not proceeding into stage 2 yet. She gets occasional earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. She does have a hearing loss and has difficulties distinguishing between vowel sounds. Other joints that bother her include her right hip, left knee, and right ankle. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B127 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is slightly off to the left side about 1-2 mm. The mandibular dental midline and chin are actually pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, B127 has an AP maxillary deficiency by about 5 mm and the chin appears retruded by about 10 mm. She has a very prominent labiomental fold. The chin appears prominent relative to the AP position of the lower incisors. Lower two-thirds of the face appears somewhat short vertically. As B127 postures her mandible forward, it does improve her overall facial balance, but she continues to have a very prominent labiomental fold. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth on the left side back to the second molars, and, on the right side, she has back through her first molar exposed. She has a diastema between the lower central incisors. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a small diastema between the central incisors. She has a full Class II cuspid relationship and an overjet of about 10 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of about 2 mm. As B127 slides her lower jaw forward into a Class I cuspid position, she tends to go into bilateral posterior crossbites. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively healthy and relatively normal in architecture. Intranasally, the left turbinate looks relatively normal in size and the right one appears mild to moderately enlarged. The septum is reasonably straight. There could be some mild obstruction perhaps on the right side. On opening, she has a definite significant pop in the left joint at about 25 mm of opening and closing about 15-20. On the right side, she has a softer pop on opening at 10-15 mm and closing at 10. Maximal incisal opening is 47 mm, opening without pain or discomfort about 34 mm. Excursion movement to the right 5 mm, to the left 8 mm. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseter muscles, medial pterygoids, retromandibular area, and milder tenderness over the right TMJ.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the sinuses appear relatively clear. The joints look a little bit arthritic. She has impacted third molars x4 and she has an impacted and erupted mandibular right second molar. The rest of the teeth are erupted in place. Coronal view shows that she has a significantly deviated nasal septum in the bony area going off closer to the bottom towards the left side and it does go over towards to the right side further up. Turbinates appear hyperplastic particularly on the left side and appear to create a lot of airway obstruction. Sinuses actually look relatively clear. Axial view shows that the turbinates are enlarged, particularly on the left side and the sinuses are clear. Left TMJ sagittal view shows the presence of some arthritic changes with flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and some peaking superiorly towards the medial side of the joint and also a little bit towards the lateral side. Joint space may be decreased vertically and posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep and somewhat elongated. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little more arthritic than the opposite side. There appears to be loss of vertical and posterior bone. There is anterior beaking present and flattening of the anterior head of the condyle. The condyle appears small vertically and anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is actually quite large and elongated. Left TMJ coronal view shows that there is some arthritic changes to the condyle. Vertical joint space appears decreased particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Lateral rim curves inferiorly only about 2 mm or so. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit narrow mediolaterally. There may some decreased vertical joint space, but not too significant. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about a good 4 mm. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B127 has some AP maxillary deficiency and AP mandibular deficiency. She has a low occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway appears reasonably good, although it is slightly decreased at the soft palate level with an AP dimension of about 6 mm and at the base of the tongue it measures about 6 mm as well. She has some over angulation of the maxillary incisors and also the mandibular incisors. Pogonion appears fairly prominent bony-wise and increased thickness of the soft tissue at pogonion where it measures about 17-18 mm while the lip thickness are closer to 12 mm. Tooth size analysis shows that there is a Bolton's difference of almost 2 mm.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction. Significant AP mandibular hypoplasia. Maxillary AP hypoplasia. Posterior vertical maxillary hyperplasia. Transverse maxillary hypoplasia. Class II occlusion. A 10-mm overjet relationship.
Over angulation of the maxillary incisors. AP macrogenia. Anterior vertical and mandibular hypoplasia.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Impacted third molars x4.
Impacted and possibly ankylosed mandibular right second molar.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisors roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Consider having mandibular right second molar uncovered to try to extrude it into the oral cavity, if it is felt this tooth can be salvaged. If not, it can be removed at the same time as the major surgery is performed. Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a clockwise direction.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance it, move the posterior aspect superiorly, and expand.
Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to lengthen the anterior mandible vertically. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4 as well as the mandibular right second molar if the tooth is ankylosed and nonsalvageable. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Consider dental implant and crown to replace the mandibular right second molar if that tooth needs to be surgically removed.

B127 MRI AGE: 14/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost vertical volume. There appears to be discal tissue present, but there appears to be a pannus almost surrounding the disc on this side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm. There appears to be decreased vascularity associated with the condyle. Discs may be anteriorly and medially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that also appears to have lost some volume. There is a more normal joint space in this side, although I could not identify any discal tissue present. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm. There may be some decreased vascularization to the condyle. The discal tissue may be anteriorly and medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that actually a little better morphology than seen on the coronal view. There is some significant flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and some superior peaking of the condyle. Articular eminence is quite steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting along the posterior and inferior aspect of the articular eminence. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is some restricted translation of the condyle and disc, but the disc appears to go into a reduced position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears more arthritic than the other side. The condyle is smaller vertically and anteroposteriorly. There is anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is quite steep and elongated. The disc is sitting anterior to the condyle and almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc is more degenerated on this side than the opposite side. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint space, but not quite as much as the opposite side. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with early reduction but some limited translation. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with some degenerative changes and without reduction on opening with restricted condylar translation.
