B021
B021 is 51 years old and is a self-referral. B021's TMJ problems began when she was about 17 years of age when she sustained blunt trauma to the jaws. She developed symptoms in the right joint. She believes her bite actually fit together fairly well up to that point in time. Following that incident, she noticed very slowly that her bite started to change until she got to the point where only her back teeth on the right side touched and all other teeth were out of occlusion. Since age 33 through the present, she has been on and off splints and night guards. She has had her current splint one year and four months. She has had 20 to 25 splints and night guards over the years. She had orthodontics from 34 to 44. It was suggested to her to orthognathic surgery, but her pain was so severe that she opted not to have that performed. She has had physical therapy on and off beginning 20 years ago through the current time.

She gets earaches on the right side, occasional tinnitus, and moderate vertigo. She has decreased hearing on the right side. She has problems with the joints in her hands and her knees. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at night as well as during the day. She cannot chew without having significant pain. Her speech has been affected. Her gums are receding likely due to the splint wearing and the chronic clenching and bruxism.

She gets headaches at a level of 5 in the right temporal and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 7, diet at 7, disability at 9. She takes the following medications:

Lunesta.
Cymbalta.
Albuterol. Dolobid p.r.n. Parafon Forte p.r.n.
B021 has moderate difficulties breathing through her nose, and she is a mouth breather at least part time at night. She does snore at night, and she has moderate daytime somnolence. She does not believe that she has sleep apnea. She does have difficulty sleeping at night and this is a rather severe condition for her.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: In frontal view, B021 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is zero. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, B021 has fairly good balance with the upper lip and cheeks and nose, although she may be just slightly deficient 2 to 3 mm in the maxilla. The mandible appears significantly retruded and the chin neckline is extremely short. The lower third face is increased in vertical length. The mandible appears to be retruded about 10 to 12 mm. Intraorally, B021 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has crowns on the mandibular right first and second molars and first molar. She has some mild crowding and an accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has got crowns on the first and second molars on the left side and first molar on the right side. In centric occlusion, she bites on the right first and second molars and has a little bit of a buccal cross bite tendency there. The left side is completely open with about a 2-mm open bite in the molar area and probably 3 mm bicuspid and about 2 mm anteriorly. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship by about 3 to 4 mm. On both sides, she has a slight tendency towards a buccal cross bite. Oropharyngeal tissues all look normal and healthy. Intranasally, she has hypertrophied turbinates. The septum is deviated at least on the I-CAT off to the left side significantly, almost touching the lateral nasal wall. To palpation, she has high moderate to low severe pain in the right TMJ, right shoulder, and high moderate pain in the right posterior neck area and moderate in the right masseter. On opening, she has a pop in the left joint at about 20 mm of opening and about 10 mm of closing. In the right side, she has crepitus type noises.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a root canal in the maxillary right first molar. Sinuses look relatively clear. She has crowns on the maxillary left molars, mandibular left first molar, maxillary right first molar, and mandibular left molars. She has significant arthritic changes in the right TMJ. The left joint appears to have better morphology. Waters view shows that she has enlarged turbinates. The septum is deviated off to the left side in the bony area. Sinuses look relatively clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows that she has arthritic changes within the joints. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has better morphology and joint space is a little better balanced. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the left condyle and some restricted translation of the right condyle. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has some constricture of the oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of about 5 mm at the base of the tongue and a little bit greater at the soft palate level. She has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship and anterior open bite tendency.

Basic diagnoses for B021 would be as follows:
Right TMJ severe reactive arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with severe deformation. Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction. AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Class II end-on occlusion. Decrease oropharyngeal airway of 5 mm (normal 11 mm).
Hypertrophied nasal turbinates. Deviated nasal septum with spurring.
Nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain. Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Significant tooth size discrepancy with a 's difference of 4 mm.
Sleep apnea symptoms.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies, if they are necessary. Open about 1 mm of space between each upper lateral and cuspid to help correct for the tooth size discrepancy. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior 6 teeth removing a total of about 3 mm of tooth structure to correct for the significant tooth size discrepancy and keep from flaring the lower incisor any further forward. CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a slight counterclockwise direction. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Bilateral TMJ coronoidotomies.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5. Restorative dentistry to build up lateral incisor with bonding, veneers, or crowns.

An alternative treatment for B021 if she would prefer would be to try to put the articular discs back in position in both joints as well as perform orthognathic surgery which would include bilateral sagittal split osteotomies and maxillary osteotomies as well as the intranasal procedures. The problem with this procedure is that I am very concerned about the prognosis of her right TMJ. The disc is so deformed and there is so much reactive arthritis in the joint that I do not feel the result will be very good in that she will likely end up with a total joint prosthesis. I am not sure if there is even enough disc to cover the head of the condyle. Besides that, her disc has been displaced and nonreducing for over 20 years. She has a substantial probability of developing major adhesions and further degenerative arthritic changes. She will think about what she would like to do.

B021 MRI AGE: 51
Sagittal osteotomy left TMJ shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is a little bit of sclerosis on the top and some mild anterior beaking. Laterally, the articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced, but over medially the disc appears to be in better position. Articular eminence is fairly steep.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is smaller in size than the opposite side. There is significantly anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is not quite as deep on this side. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is flattening on the anterior head towards the lateral aspect of the joint. The disc appears to be significantly deformed.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Joint space appears adequate, although slightly narrow on the medial side. Discal tissue may be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears more arthritic with sclerosis on the top. Lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat. It appears there may be some discal tissue anteromedially to the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal open view shows a condyle that has very good translation as does the articular disc with the disc in a reduced position. Condyle comes well anterior to the articular eminence, but well forward of the articular eminence.

Right TMJ open sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good translation, but the articular disc appears to remain anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Left TMJ sini examination shows that the condyle and disc appear to move in unison and demonstrate good translatory abilities.
Right TMJ dynamic view shows that the arthritis in the condyle appears more progressive than in some of the other views. There is extreme flattening on the head of the condyle and anterior beaking present. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced, significantly deformed, and remains nonreducing. The disc demonstrates questionable salvageability.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint but with early reduction. Right TMJ advanced arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and severe deformation. The disc may not be salvageable.

B021 I-CAT AGE: 51
Coronal view shows that the turbinates appear fairly large. Sinuses appear clear. The left condyle appears fairly smooth and joint space looks reasonably good except somewhat decreased over medially towards the anterior aspect of the condyle. In the right joint, there appears to be a little bit of arthritis present with a little bit of small osteophyte sticking off the medial side. There appears to be a little bit less joint space compared to the opposite side, particularly towards the medial aspect of the joint.

Left TMJ sagittal joint view shows a condyle that appears postured forward slightly in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular eminence is fairly steep. She appears to have relatively normal oropharyngeal airway.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears much more arthritic and with flattening on the anterior head and anterior beaking present and a little bit of posterior peaking. Articular eminence appears that there may be areas of degenerative change in it as well.

IMPRESSION:
Right TMJ arthritis. Hypertrophied turbinates.
Large septal spur off the left side that extends far into the left lateral nasal airway.
