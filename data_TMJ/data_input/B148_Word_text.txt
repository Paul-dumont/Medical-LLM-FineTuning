B148
B148 is 47 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B148's TMJ problems we believe began around 15 years ago of unknown etiology. She had orthodontics from age 13 to 15 that included 4 bicuspid extractions and she also had her wisdom teeth removed. She was in retainers from around age 15 to 21. Fifteen years ago, because she developed pain predominantly in the right side, a mouth guard was made for her. It was brought to her attention that she was clenching and bruxing her teeth at that time. She has had no other treatment to date for her problems. During the past 5 years, her pain factors have gotten significantly worse.

She gets headaches about once a month in the right frontal and perhaps the anterior aspect of the temple area at about a level of 5. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, right side worse than left, and average daily pain at 1. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability at 5.

Primary concerns that she has at this time include the following:
TMJ pain. Teeth and jaws are not properly aligned. The palate is narrow.
She has no problems with earaches, has some mild tinnitus, and occasional vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her knees, right hips, and thumbs. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at night time and may do it occasionally during the day but can catch herself.

Medications she takes include the following:
Etodolac for menstrual cramps.
Vicodin approximately 2 tablets per month.
Multiple supplements and she has included a list of those.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, she has some facial asymmetry with significantly increased prominence of the right angle of the mandible compared to the left side. The right side extends laterally approximately 5 mm. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 2 mm. The maxillary midline may be just 1 mm off towards the left side with the mandible dental midline fairly close to being on the midline. The chin may be just slightly to the left about a couple of millimeters. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 4-5 mm. Chin appears to be retruded by approximately 15 mm. Chin neckline is short, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. Intraorally, she is missing the lower appears to be first bicuspids. She has a very narrow transverse width to the lower arch. The molars are actually in slight lingual inclination. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. There is some mild crowding of the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she is missing probably the first bicuspids. She is basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has a slight open bite tendency on the right side. As she bites, she does feel she hits first on the posterior right side. However, she might hit in the bicuspid first molar area on the left side early as well. She has a little bit of a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the left cuspid being almost 2 mm higher than the right cuspid. There is a posterior yaw in the maxilla and mandible with the joints being shifted about 2-3 mm off to the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively healthy. B148 has very narrow nostrils. The septum deviates a little bit to the left side then back towards the right, but does not appear to create any significant airway obstruction. Turbinates are relatively normal in size, at least at the anterior aspect. She has about a 1 mm anterior deep bite relationship. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the temporalis muscles. On opening and closing, she has crepitation and she gets locked open on the right side where she has to manipulate the jaw to get it closed again. The maximal incisal opening is 48 mm and about 35 mm without too much discomfort. Excursion movement to the right 10 mm and to the left 11 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the four first bicuspids and four third molars. She has a root canal in the maxillary first molar. Joints appear arthritic, more so on the right side than the left side. Sinuses appear reasonably clear. Bony septum appears reasonably straight.

Coronal view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Turbinates are moderate in size, but there appears to be adequate airway around it.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear and the turbinates are moderate in size with some airway present.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show there is some significant arthritis present with anterior beaking and sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There appears to be some loss of vertical condylar volume. There may be some pseudocysts in the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show that she has advanced arthritis in this joint as well. There is decreased joint space and a lot of sclerosis on the head of the condyle as well as pseudocysts on the head of the condyle. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination in both joints.

Left TMJ coronal view shows that the condyle appears to have undergone some resorption with loss of vertical height and the condyle is somewhat narrow. There is significantly decreased lateral joint space. The vertical joint space appears more normal. The condyle, however, does appear arthritic and degenerated. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is arthritic and has multiple small pseudocysts in the head of the condyle. There is decreased vertical joint space. The condyle is significantly larger than the opposite side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B148 has a retruded maxilla and mandible. Occlusal plane angle is moderately inclined. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 8 mm at the soft palate level and about 9 mm at the base of the tongue.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
1. Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis.
2. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
3. Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
4. Posterior yaw in the maxilla and mandible with the jaws being rotated towards the right approximately 3 mm.
5. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 2 mm higher than the right side.
6. Missing maxillary and mandible first bicuspids.
7. TMJ pain.
8. High occlusal plane angle.
9. Accentuated curve of Wilson in the lower arch.
10. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2-3 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Open space of about 0.5 mm between the upper lateral incisors and cuspids to help compensate for the tooth size discrepancy. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Consider expanding the lower molars and bicuspids slightly on both sides to decrease the accentuated curve of Wilson.
2. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
3. Surgery. a. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with correction of the posterior yaw and transverse leveling with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance, down graft it posteriorly, level if transversely, and expand with bone plate and bone grafting stabilization. c.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.	Bilateral coronoidotomies.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B148 MRI AGE: 47/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is severely arthritic and there are also arthritic changes in the fossa. There is decreased joint space and there is fluid within the joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. It appears larger than the opposite side, but it still has significant degenerative changes associated with it including relatively large divots towards the lateral aspect of the condyle. There appears to be some heterotopic bone off the lateral rim that extends down into the defect on the lateral pole of the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite arthritic with flattening on the superior head and discontinuity in the cortical bone. There is some sclerosis in some other areas. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly and quite thickened. The disc is more deformed at the lateral aspect of the joint and there appears to be decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space towards the medial side of the joint. There appear to be some hot spots of fluid on the medial side of the joint that appear almost like cystic formations. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic with sclerosis within it. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc is foreshortened and appears significantly degenerated. There are some pseudocystic formations within the condylar head. Right TMJ open view shows that she has good translation and the discs remain anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular discs dislocated with severe deformation and non-reducing. The patient is a candidate for total joint prostheses.
