B486 
B486 is 37 years old, referred by Dr. XX. B486 has had a previous tonsillectomy and cholecystectomy. When B486  was three years old she was bitten by a dog around the face area and had fairly extensive injuries. She was not sure if this was contributory to her current situation.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Pain and inability to open the jaws.
Bite is off.
Lower jaw seems to be becoming more recessive.
Significant difficulties breathing through her nose.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Vicodin ES.
Lodine.
Flexeril.
Allegra-D.
Relpax as required for severe headaches. Afrin. Ambien (she uses it only when she is traveling.)

PREVIOUS TREATMENT FOR HER JAWS AND TMJs: 20 years ago, orthodontic appliances were removed. 4 years ago, she received a bite plate. Last year she had arthrocentesis on the right side.

By history, B486's TMJ problems began prior to 20 years ago. She remembers having clicking and popping in her joints when she had her orthodontic appliances on and then it went away but the when the appliances were removed the clicking and popping began again. Her problems got worse about four years ago when the left side started to have clicking and pain associated with it. She was placed into a bite splint and the left side got better. However, last year during a job training session that was fairly stressful, she developed rather severe pain in the right TMJ and associated areas. She had a splint made but it was not effective and it may have been making it worse. Dr. XX at the XX worked with her bite splint. He eventually took it away from her as it was making her situation worse. Last year, Dr. X performed a right TMJ arthrocentesis and this helped for about two weeks and then her pain problems actually became worse. The splint was infected. Since the more recent onset of her TMJ problems during this past year, B486 feels that her bite has significantly shifted. B486 currently gets earaches on the right side at about a level of 8. She has tinnitus on the right side and she has developed fairly significant vertigo that has even required ER visits. She has no hearing loss. The only joints that she has problems include a herniated disc at L3 and L4. She does have seasonal allergies that are fairly significant. She is unaware of any food allergies and is unaware of any problems wearing jewelry.

 
She is very much aware of significant problems with the clenching at nighttime and also during the day. She rates her headaches at a level of 8 and they occur throughout the head area, though initiate at the right TMJ and temple area but involve the entire head. Headaches occur daily. The Relpax is able to interrupt the cycle. Otherwise, B486 believes that her headaches would be continuous. She rates her current TMJ pain at a level of 10, average daily facial pain and headache level at 8, jaw function at 9, diet at 10, and disability at 9. She is essentially on a liquid diet at this time and unable to chew.

In frontal view, B486 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. The right side of the lower jaw may be just slightly longer vertically by may be a couple of mm compared to the left side. Upper lip length is 23 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 4.5 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline.

In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is probably about 3 to 4 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is retruded by probably 5 mm or so. Chin is retruded by probably 12 to 15 mm. Intraorally, B486 is missing maxillary mandibular first bicuspids. She has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some moderate crowding in the lower anterior arch. There is good attached gingiva except around the left central incisor. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship being about 2 mm Class II on the left and probably 4 on the right. B486 does not feel her left teeth touching at this time and this is a change that she has noted in her bite. There is an anterior deep bite of about 3 to 4 mm. She has an overjet of about 2 mm. Oropharyngeal areas look healthy. Uvula is mildly enlarged. The soft palate and faucial pillars appear relatively normal. B486 does report difficulties breathing through her nose. She has to use a lot of Afrin and feels as though she is almost addicted to it and would like to decrease usage of it. However, without the Afrin she says that she cannot breathe at all through her nose. Intranasally, she has moderate to severe enlargement of the turbinates with the left side being larger than the right side. The septum is deviated off to the right side posteriorly. She has moderate to severe nasal airway obstruction. She has a wide columella and very narrow nostrils. Holding the nostrils open with a nasal scope did improve her airway. Luminal valves appear relatively normal. She is not aware of snoring but she does have daytime somnolence of a moderate degree but she is unaware of any sleep apnea symptoms. She does have a sleep disorder and wakes up frequently caused currently by the pain factors. She has not slept well for the past six years because of pain factors and airway obstruction problems. Maximal incisal opening is 30 mm but only about 15 mm without severe pain. Excursive movement to the right 3 mm, to the left 2 mm. On opening, she has crepitation in the right TMJ and on the left side she has a vague click of at about 25 mm of opening and about 20 mm of closing but it may be unrelated to the disc position since on the MRI is nonreducing.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four first bicuspids and all four third molars. She has crowns on all four first molars and on both mandibular second molars. She has root canals on the maxillary first molars, right central incisor, mandibular second molars and left first molar.
 
Sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear enlarged particularly on the left side. She appears to have arthritis in both jaw joints.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic. It is flattened on top and has a little bit of anterior beaking present. Decreased superior joint space. Bone in the fossa looks a little bit funny. Articular eminence is moderately steep and somewhat elongated.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears sclerotic and appears to have an osteophyte sticking up off the top of it. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep and appears to be deformed as well with a posterior slope at the tip of the articular eminence. On opening, there is restricted translation in both joints but with greater restriction in the right side. In the open view, the right side appears much more arthritic than the left joint.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. The bony septum is reasonably straight so that the deviation seen in the septum is apparently in the cartilage. Turbinates appear enlarged and there does not appear to be much of a nasal airway. Transverse width of the nose appears somewhat constricted.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B486 has an AP deficiency of the maxilla and AP deficiency of the mandible. Oropharyngeal airway although a little bit decreased appears adequate. She does have an obtuse nasal labial angle and upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably about 4 mm.

B486 had a bird that was a Nandaya Conure. She had Noah for five years. About six years ago she gave Noah away because it was attacking her husband and they were having a baby on the way. It was given to a veterinarian receptionist and the bird died about two years ago of unknown causes. Of significant interest is that her allergy problems began after she got the bird. Prior to that she really had no allergy symptoms. After she got the bird she went through three years of allergy shots. She also has four dogs and three birds. The bird would actually sleep with her at night. She raised him from when he was an age. He lived for about nine years. Life expectancy for that kind of bird apparently is only about 12 years. She apparently has developed some GI problems of unknown etiology to date.

OTHER SYSTEMS: B486 does have back problems with L3-4, but apparently at least currently no other joint problems. She had significant problems with urinary tract infection when she was pregnancy six years ago. She has nocturia x1. She has a history of an ovarian cyst and fibrocystic breast disease. She has one child age six years. She has had no miscarriages and no fertility problems. She has had a vaginal discharge problem for the last six months and has been treated with Diflucan and Flagyl but unsuccessfully. Her physician suspects a bacterial infection.

She has had pink eye x5 in the past and she gets frequent conjunctivitis particularly in the springtime. She has burning, itching and dryness of her eyes. She has eye allergies. She does wear contacts. She has chronic sinus problems. Smoked for about two years about ten years ago but quit. She smoked about ten cigarettes per day at that time. She does have problems with earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. She gets frequent colds and viruses. She gets recurrent sore throats, hoarseness and laryngitis. She has had bronchitis x20 and pneumonia x1 which occurred last year. She had some bouts of bronchitis when she was younger but the frequency increased after she had the bird.

She had her gallbladder removed 7 years ago when she was six months pregnant. She has consistent problems with constipation and does have pain and cramping associated with it. She is not aware of having any STDs. She does have a lot of fatigue problems and she has some memory affects but she believes that it could be related to the medication she is currently on. She has been exposed to her parrot for four years beginning at the age of 24. She has three cats currently and they do eat birds. She has four dogs that do not eat birds. She has had no exposure to hoofed animals and she has no implants. Her husband had problems with knee and shoulder. She does have a history of having a high ANA titer but this was a few years ago.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis being worse on the right side as compared to the left side. Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocations with severe degenerative changes and nonreducing.
Probably Chlamydia psittaci infection right TMJ.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. AP mandibular deficiency. Moderate high occlusal plane angle. Class II end-on occlusion being worse on the right side as compared to the left side. Slight open bite on the posterior left side. Hypertrophied turbinates. Narrowed nostrils.
Wide columella. Nasal airway obstruction.

Myofascial pain. Earaches.
Tinnitus.
Vertigo.
 
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Periodontal evaluation of lower anterior arch, particularly the left central incisor area. Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch. Consider slenderizing the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them any further forward.
CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla and down graft it posteriorly. Bilateral coronoidectomies.

Partial turbinectomies.
Reconstruct columella.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

MRI Evaluation
Age: 35/F
Date of Birth:  
Date of MRI:  
Date of Interpretation:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral pole may extend slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There may be a little discal tissue towards the medial side and then discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Cortical bone appears to be intact. In one area, the bone structures are fairly close indicative of perhaps a possible perforation. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has reasonably good mediolateral width. The condyle appears a little bit darker indicative of decreased flow and more sclerotic bone. Decreased superior joint space. A little osteophyte sticking off the lateral pole of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. Discal tissue appears to be displaced anteriorly. Cortical bone appears to be intact for the most part.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes with flattening on the anterior head particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be a little bony defect in the articular eminence area. The bone appears a little bit rough on the anterior aspect of the fossa and articular eminence. Articular eminence is fairly steep. There appears to be an anterior osteophyte present. Disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. A little inflammatory process is seen in the bilaminar tissues. On opening, the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. There is some restriction in translation. Articular disc is short anteroposteriorly.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that demonstrates significant osteoarthritic changes with anterior beaking with a rather sharp point as well as an osteophyte. There appears to be some degenerative changes up in the fossa. The articular eminence is quite steep and actually has a slight backward curvature at the apex. Decreased superior joint space and posterior joint space. The condyle appears more sclerotic than the opposite side. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. At the lateral aspect of the joint there is a large fluid collection extending almost lateral to the fossa area. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle and the articular disc is anteriorly displaced, nonreducing. The articular disc itself is obliterated. It actually appears that there may be a pannus.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with significant deformation and nonreducing. Right TMJ severe arthritis affecting the condyle as well as the fossa and articular disc dislocation without reduction and significant degenerative changes.
Questionable salvageability of the articular discs particularly on the right side.
