B246 MRI Evaluation
Age: 13/Male
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
The quality of the MRI is terrible.

Left TMJ coronal view is difficult to identify bony structures.
Right TMJ likewise is difficult to identify the bony structures.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of peaking on the top of the condyle and a little anterior beaking but difficult to tell. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is in a vertical orientation within the joint space. It may be slightly anteriorly displaced and it may be acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posterior. However, joint space appears fairly well balanced and equal. On opening, the disc does reduce in position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears as though there are some significant arthritic changes. There may be some loss of condylar volume. There is some anterior beaking. Decreased posterior joint space and perhaps decreased superoposterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc appears to remain anteriorly displaced on opening. Translation is somewhat restricted.

IMPRESSION: Essentially nondiagnostic MRIs.
Left TMJ mild arthritis and probable articular disc dislocation anteriorly. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.

B246
B246is 13 years old and referred by Dr. ___. B246 is in good health with no major medical problems. He does report having some fainting spells "blackouts/felt faint" that appear to be perhaps diet-related. The only medication he currently takes is Allegra-D 2 per day. He does take some ibuprofen for his headaches when he gets them. B246's jaw joint problems began about 3 to 4 years of unknown etiology. They became aware of it when it became obvious that he was having popping noises in his jaw joints. He has had no treatment to date for this situation.

B246 has no problems with earaches. He gets occasional tinnitus, occasional vertigo that may be diet-related. Other joints that bother him currently are his knees. B246 does have a history of seasonal allergies. He is not aware of clenching or bruxism. He gets headaches about once every 2 weeks at about a level of 4 in the frontal and temple areas. He gets some TMJ pain at about a level of 3 but on an average day he does not really have any significant pain problems. He rates his jaw function at 5, diet at 2, disability at 0.

In frontal view, B246 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 0. B246 has some increased fullness in the left side of the face in the masseter area. Chin appears a little bit deviated off towards the right side. Maxillary midline is off to the left side about 1 mm, right side at least 1 mm. The chin is off to the right side probably about 3 mm. In profile view, he has fairly good fullness in the upper lip. He has about a 90-degree nasal labial angle. The mandible is retruded. Chin-neckline is not well-defined. The chin may be retruded about 12 to 15 mm. As B246 postures his mandible forward probably about 10 to 12 mm it does improve overall facial balance. Intraorally, B246 has mixed dentition with a retained primary E side. He has the rest of his teeth back through the first molars erupted in. The second molars are not erupted in yet. Some spacing around the bicuspids. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the first molars. B246 has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. Transversely, there may be just a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being no more than 1 mm vertically shorter than the right side. Intraorally, oral tissues look healthy. The uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars are all within normal limits. The tonsils are quite hyperplastic but he reports less than 2 sore throat episodes per year and so he has been advised not to have his tonsils removed by the consulting physician. Intranasally, the septum appears reasonably straight. The turbinate on the right side appears enlarged. The left side turbinate appears a little bit more normal. The columella, luminal valves etc. all look pretty much normal. He may be a mouth breather at night. He says a friend of his told him that he does snore some. He says he has some daytime tiredness. He has basically a Class I occlusion with about a 2 to 3 mm overbite relationship. Overjet is about 1 to 2 mm. On opening and closing, the right joint seems to function relatively smoothly. On the left side between 5 and 10 mm of opening there is a palpable click present and a closing one about 5 mm. On the right side he can manipulate the jaw and make a loud audible pop that can easily be heard from some distance away. To palpation, he has no tenderness around the head and neck area except for some mild tenderness over the left SCM. Maximal incisal opening is about 55 mm. Excursive movement to the right side 7 mm, to the left 10 mm. B246 


RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of all the teeth. There is a retained crown of the right primary E but the second bicuspid is erupting beneath it. All four second molars are present. All four third four molars are developing. The sinuses look reasonably clear. The right condyle appears short in height compared to the left condyle.

Waters view shows a little bit of cloudiness in the right sinus as compared to the left one and the right sinus appears a little bit smaller than the left one. The right turbinate is quite large and it appears to block most of the airway. The left turbinate appears a little bit more normal in size at least at this time. There may be a septal spur coming off the septum higher above the inferior turbinate. Otherwise, the bony septum is reasonably straight.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be a little bit arthritic. There may be some decreased posterior joint space but not too significant. The condylar head and neck length is considerably shorter as compared to the left side. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Left TMJ coronal view shows what appears to be decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. Condylar morphology appears a little bit better than the opposite side. On opening, there is good translation on both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B246 has a Class II skeletal relationship and high occlusal plane angle. Tonsils are quite prominent and quite visible radiographically. They extend down into the oropharynx to the bottom of the third cervical vertebrae. Upper incisors show that he has had a fracture to the incisal edges of those teeth and composites had been placed to build those teeth up. Upper incisors appear slightly overangulated as do the lowers. Oropharyngeal airway from soft palate to posterior pharyngeal wall measures about 5 mm. The base of the tongue measures about 8 mm although the tonsils fill up the majority of that space. Tooth size analysis reveals a 's difference of -1.5 mm. He is a little bit Class II on the right side by about 2 mm or so. Models can be hand manipulated into good Class I cuspid molar relationship.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption being worse on the right side as compared to the left side. AP mandibular deficiency. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Class II end-on occlusion on the right side but Class I on the left.
Maxillary midline shifted off to the left 1 mm, mandibular dental midline shifted off to the right 1 mm, chin shifted off to the right 2 mm. High occlusal plane angle.
TMJ pain.
Headaches. Retained mandibular right primary E but second bicuspid directly beneath it. B246 Page 3

Unerupted second molars x4.
Developing and impacted third molars x4.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Hyperplastic tonsils but relatively asymptomatic. Predominately a mouth breather.
Right turbinate hyperplasia.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Surgery stage I.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery stage II (does perform at about the age of 17)
Maxillary osteotomies to down graft the posterior aspect and transversely level.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Augmentation genioplasty.
Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4. Consider possible turbinectomies if nasal airway problems persist. Consider possible tonsillectomies if it is felt at that time the tonsils are affecting airway or if there are recurring infections associated with them. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. It appears there may be a small osteophyte off the medial side. Articular disc appears to be in place but is medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to be smaller in size. The fossa itself appears quite flat. The lateral rim of the fossa has a minimal downward curvature. Cortical bone appears to be intact although there possibly could be loss of vertical height. There appears to be discal tissue anteromedial to the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows out laterally there appears to be some destruction of the condylar head more medially. The condyle appears to be in a little bit better condition. Towards the lateral aspect the disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. More medially the disc appears to be in a little bit better position. There is some flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. In T2 films, there appears to be some degenerative changes on the condylar head particularly at the lateral aspect and also more medial there appears to be some flattening and perhaps a little bit of erosion. There may be a hot spot on top of the condyle with some erosion beneath it. The disc appears to be in vertical orientation within the joint. In the open views the condyle does show good translation and the disc does reduce into position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has flattening on the head. A little bit of anterior beaking present. Increased superior joint space. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There appears to be evidence of condylar resorption. It appears there is less condylar volume on this side as compared to the opposite side. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is deformed and short anteroposteriorly. On opening, it appears that the disc does reduce but probably late in the opening process.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ resorptive arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced but probably with very early reduction. Right TMJ resorptive arthritis and articular disc dislocation with probably late reduction.
Possible bilateral TMJ ICR.

B246
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Incisal opening is 42 mm. Excursive movements are about 4 mm in each direction. He does get some headaches when he does not take his Klonopin at about a level of 3 in the frontal and temple areas and he wakes up with these. This is indicative of him clenching at night. With the Klonopin he has no trouble with headaches. Occlusion is stable. He does have some turbos on his maxillary molars that hold the posterior teeth apart a little bit. Joints seem to function smoothly. To palpation he has some very minimal tenderness over the left TMJ. He is currently on a Medrol Dosepak because of a soccer injury to his foot. He is on his third round now. No earaches, vertigo or hearing loss. He gets occasional tinnitus. No other joints bother him. He does clench and grind and his teeth at night. We need to stay on the Klonopin. I told his mother if she observes him clenching on the Klonopin that we probably need to increase the dose. He otherwise is doing well. He is going to go to Europe to play soccer and Wells and England. He is to return to see me in 1 year. He currently is about 10 months postsurgery.

B246
Telephone conversation with Dr. : I saw B246 this summer and he was progressing well. He is to have his orthognathic surgery when he is about 17 so Dr. may not want to begin the orthodontics until he is 16. If Dr. has any questions, he will contact me.
