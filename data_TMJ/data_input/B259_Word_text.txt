Date of Interpretation: 

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite large and actually extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There is osteophytic formation on the lateral pole that extends beyond the lateral rim. Vertical and medial joint space looks fairly. The lateral joint space is significantly decreased and possibly could have bone-on-bone contact there. The articular disc is medially displaced and covers only the medial half of the condylar head. Some sclerotic areas on top of the condyle. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa probably 3 to 4 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit smaller in mediolateral width though the lateral aspect does come out almost adjacent to the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm. There is a significantly decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears to be medially displaced covering only the medial half of the condyle. Some areas of sclerosis on the head of the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. No evidence of discal tissue at the lateral aspect. Some mild anterior beaking present at the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is more normal architecture towards the medial side of the joint. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and medially displaced towards the lateral aspect of the joint but more medially the disc is in a more normal anteroposterior position relative to the condyle. Out laterally there is significant flattening on the superior head of the condyle. The lateral aspect of the condyle extends beyond the articular eminence. No significant inflammatory response seen in the joint. On opening, the disc does reduce and there is good translation of both the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening and some osteoarthritic changes particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially the condyle has a better architecture. Out laterally the disc is not readily identifiable and the joint space is significantly decreased indicative of medial displacement of the disc. More towards the medial aspect of the joint the disc is in a little bit anteroposterior direction although just slightly forward to the most normal position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space and also the inferior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and articular disc with the disc reducing.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc medially displaced as well as anteriorly displaced towards the lateral aspect of the joint. There is a lateral osteophyte extending beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc medially displaced as well as slight anterior displacement. B259 

B259 is 57 years old and is referred by Dr. __. B259 has a previous history of allergies and bronchitis. She had her nose injured in a car accident at one time. She had a partial hysterectomy 25 years ago, breast enhancement in 23 years ago and 3 years ago, she had a brow, face, and neck lift and lip enhancement. 11 years ago, B259 was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and currently takes Levoxyl 88 mcg per day. She has had an adverse reaction to Keflex and cephalexin. MEDICATIONS: Klonopin 0.5 mg q.h.s.
Effexor XR 35 mg per day.
Niacin 1000 mg per day. Estradiol 0.53 mg per week.
Levoxyl 88 mcg per day.
Lipitor 20 mg daily.
Aspirin 0.81 mg daily.

B259's problems began in her 20s when she started clenching her teeth. Her jaw joints did not begin clicking until her 40s. All these factors are of unknown etiology.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Jaw and muscle pain.
Clicking particularly in the left jaw joint.
Clenching and grinding of the teeth is uncontrollable.
Occasional difficulties chewing.
Problems with rather severe snoring. However, she has no problems breathing through her nose and has no history of mouth breathing.

B259 does have genetically predisposed depression. She did have a difficult childhood. Her mother was born with a cleft lip and palate that was not repaired until the mother was about 20 years of age. She wakes up at night clenching her teeth and sometimes will wake up at night with her hands clenched making them a little bit sore and achy as well. She is very much aware of the clenching and grinding of her teeth at night as well as during the day.

B259's father was abusive and actually put B259's sister in the hospital. B259 and her sister were taken away from the custody of her parents and institutionalized for at least 3 years. The only communication from her mother during that time was through letters. Then her dad passed away and B259 went back with her mother.

In frontal view, B259 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip length is 0. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline and chin. Nose is tipped a little bit off to the right side about 2 mm. In profile view, B259 has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks and nose. Chin is a little bit retruded by probably 5 to 6 mm. Chin-neckline is somewhat short and chin-neck angle is not real well defined. B259  Page 2

Intraorally, B259 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. The lower molars particularly on the right side and the bicuspids are in significant lingual inclination. She has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has fairly good attached gingiva though is quite weak around the right lateral incisor and may need to have that evaluated for possible gingival grafting. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Does have some palatal tori and she has some huge labial tori that extends well out beyond her braces. They extend from the second molars around to the cuspid bilaterally but they are much larger on the right side as compared to the left side. Anterior deep bite is about 5 mm. She has a Class II end-on occlusion being about 5 mm Class II. She has some constriction in the upper arch in the bicuspid molar area. The oropharyngeal tissues appear reasonably healthy. The uvula is a little bit enlarged. The soft palate may be a little bit elongated. Faucial pillars are moderately constricted. Tonsils are absent as they had previously been removed. B259 had multiple bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia in her early childhood. Her mother worked at ___. It was suggested that they move to a warmer climate and thus brought B259 to ___. Intranasally, the turbinates appear normal in size and the septum has a little waviness in it. It is relatively in the midline. There does not appear to be any significant nasal airway obstruction. The right TMJ seems to function relatively smoothly. However, she does give a history of having clicking and popping at times in the joints moreso on the left side as compared to the right side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She is also missing, maxillary right lateral incisor and has a 3-unit bridge replacing that tooth. She also has crowns on the left central lateral incisor. All other teeth are present. The sinuses appear relatively clear. The condyles look fairly large anteroposteriorly but have reasonable contour to them.

Water's view shows that the nasal septum in the bony aspect is deviated off to the left side at the base and off to the right side at the superior aspect. This may be due to the previous nasal trauma that she had resulting in nasal fracture. The sinuses appear clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that may be just slightly posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is some flattening in the anterior aspect as well as anterior beaking present but not too significant. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space appears fairly well balanced although slightly decreased posteriorly.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a joint that is more difficult to evaluate. Difficult to determine joint space as well as condyle morphology. The styloid process appears fairly prominent. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles. The styloid process on the left side can be seen to extend forward quite significantly.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B259 has basically a Class II skeletal relationship and occlusal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures about 7 to 8 mm, base of the tongue measures about 7 mm. B259 

The turbinate may extend beyond the hard palate. Lower incisors are slightly over-angulated. He does have a Bolton's tooth size discrepancy of 1 mm, however, I believe it is greater than that. The AP thickness of the incisor crowns contribute to the tooth size discrepancy that is noted on the models. Repositioning her models trying to achieve a Class I position results in a Class II end-on position by probably about 2 to 3 mm on each side. There is transverse excess width of the upper arch in the cuspid area that probably contributes some to this. There is probably at least 3 mm of excessive width in the upper arch in the cuspid area.

Lateral cephalometric analysis shows that the lower incisors are over-angulated and there is a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship. The occlusal plane is at 16 degrees and there is decreased oropharyngeal airway posteriorly. There is a 9-degree ANB difference.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation in a medial direction.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Class II end-on occlusion.
Transverse maxillary excess in the cuspid bicuspid area.
High occlusal plane angel.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Snoring.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of probably 2 to 3 mm. Severe clenching and bruxism.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications to try and control severe clenching and bruxism. a. Klonopin 1 mg tablet q.h.s.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Try to narrow transverse width between the cuspids and tip incisors forward to create more of "U" shaped upper arch.
Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure and retract. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to down graft the maxilla and advance slightly at the incisors as well as correct any transverse problems that may remain.
Bilaminar mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.

B259 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Incisal opening is about 44 mm. Excursive movement to the right 2 mm, left 3.5 mm. No pain around the head and neck area. No other joint problems except for in her lower back. The Klonopin 4 mg p.o. q.h.s. controls her clenching and bruxism. She would like to cut back. She is to cut back ½ mg every 3 weeks and see how she does. If she starts to clench and brux again then we will need to increase slightly to keep that under control. She is very happy with her results. No noises in her joints. Occlusion is stable. No tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. She is progressing very well. Occlusion is fine and I have given the approval that she can have her braces removed. She is doing well and is to return to see me in a few months after she gets her retainers and allows her bite to settle in a little bit.

B259 
She presents for followup evaluation. She is now 1 year 7 months post surgery. Having no pain. Rates her jaw function at 2, diet and disability at 0. She has no headaches. Incisal opening is 45 mm. Excursion movements are 2 mm in each direction. She is on a number of medications as listed on her evaluation form. She currently is taking Klonopin 4 mg at bedtime and she would like to cut back. I told her to cut back a half tablet and stay at that level for at least 2 weeks and then cut back to another half tablet for at least 2 weeks. If she starts to clench again or wakes up hurting, then she needs to go back up to the next higher dose. She is to keep informed of her progress, and she is to return to see me in August.
