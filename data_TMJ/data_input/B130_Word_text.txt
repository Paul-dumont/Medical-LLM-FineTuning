B130
B130 is 26 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. The only previous surgery that B130 has had has been fusion of L4-L5 x3. B130 believes her jaw problems began during her teenage years of unknown etiology. She had orthodontics from about the age of 12 to 16 and this included extraction of four bicuspids including the mandibular second bicuspids, maxillary first bicuspids. B130 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, nor hearing loss. The only other joints that bother her are her back. She has some clenching during the day.

B130 rates her headarches at a level of 8 and they occur in the frontal, temporal, and top of the head. She rates her average TMJ pain at 5, daily pain at 6, jaw function at 6, diet at 5, disability at 3.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B130 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 8 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is deviated just slightly to the right side by 1 to 2 mm. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is probably about 3 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is probably 6 to 8 mm AP deficient. The chin may be retruded about 10 mm. Chin neckline, however, looks fairly strong. The chin is strong compared to the AP position of the lower lip. Chin sticks out probably 6 mm beyond the lower lip. Intraorally, B130 is missing the lower second bicuspids. Molars are actually tipped lingually creating increased curve of Wilson. The lower anterior teeth are well aligned. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has a reversed curve of Spee. She is missing upper first bicuspids. Upper incisors appear as though they are almost in lingual inclination. B130 is fairly close to a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has an anterior deep bite of about 6 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and normal. Intranasally, the septum appears relatively straight. Turbinates appear enlarged and appear significantly inflamed. There may be some moderate constricture of the luminal valves. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the left TMJ, retromandibular area, left masseter, bilateral shoulders, and milder tenderness over the right TMJ and right retromandibular area. On opening, she has a click in the left joint at about 15 to 20 mm and a closing click at 10. The right side seems to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal opening is 56 mm, opening without discomfort 40 mm. Excursion movement to the right 9 mm, to the left 10 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of impacted mandibular third molars, but absence of maxillary third molars. Mandibular second bicuspids and maxillary first bicuspids are also missing. Sinuses appear reasonably clear, although there could be some polyps in the right sinus. Septum in the bony area is deviated off significantly towards the right side. The left condyle appears a little flattened anteriorly with a little peaking at the superior aspect of the condyle. Right side appears more normal. Coronal view shows that the turbinates are moderate in size. Septum is deviated significantly off towards the left side. There is a sinus polyp hanging down from the right infraorbital rim.
Axial view shows that the septum is deviated off towards the left side. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Sinuses appear relatively clear at the one cut that I have to evaluate. Right TMJ sagittal view shows condyle that has reasonably good morphology. There appears to be fairly well balanced joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint with increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There appears to be some decrease lateral joint space. Vertical joint space also appears somewhat narrow in areas. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appear may be just slightly smaller in size than the right side. Vertical joint space may be slightly decreased. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B130 has a retruded maxilla and mandible, but has AP macrogenia probably in part due to previous orthodontic treatment. Oropharyngeal airway is slightly constricted with an AP dimension at the soft palate level of about 8 mm and at the base of the tongue of 5 mm. She has a slight increased occlusal plane angle and an anterior deep bite. The roots are quite short on the incisors. Upper incisors are retro-inclined.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction. AP maxillary hypoplasia.
Vertical maxillary hyperplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia.
AP macrogenia. Headaches. TMJ pain. Impacted mandibular third molars x2.
Missing maxillary first bicuspids and mandibular second bicuspids.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Hypertrophied turbinates. Deviated nasal septum.
Nasal airway obstruction. Snoring. Resorbed roots on the maxillary incisors. Polyps, right maxillary sinus.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level the maxillary arch. Tip the lateral incisors mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level the mandibular arch.
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly approximately 6 mm and advance it forward approximately 6 to 8 mm. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a slight clockwise direction.
Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to reduce the prominence in the chin. Surgical removal of mandibular impacted third molars x2. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.
Removal of nasal polyps from right maxillary sinus. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B130 MRI AGE: 26/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good morphology. Joint space appears decreased vertically. Discs appear that they may be anteromedially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. Joint space may be just slightly wider, but difficult to tell. Discs may be anteriorly displaced, but kind of difficult to tell on the coronal views.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc reduces and there is good translation of both the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. The disc may be just slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. The head is a little bit flattened on the anterior slope at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the disc appears to be in better position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation and early reduction of the articular disc.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction. Probable right TMJ articular disc anterior dislocation with early reduction.
