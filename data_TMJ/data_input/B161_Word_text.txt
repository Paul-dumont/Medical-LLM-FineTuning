B161
B161 is 13 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B161 believes her jaw joint problems began about 1-1/2 years ago of unknown etiology. It began popping and clicking about that time. It apparently has gotten worse in the past five months ago. She began her orthodontic treatment in 13 months ago.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Growth hormone 0.65 units.
Synthroid 0.125 mg
She recently took a week of steroids and this helped decrease her pain.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Jaw and jaw joint pain.
Teeth and jaws do not fit together properly.
Difficulties eating and chewing particularly on the right side.
Cannot sleep on the right side as it tends to wake her up.
Decreased jaw opening.
Right-sided earaches.

She does get earaches on the right side but no tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is allergic to dust. She cannot wear cheap earrings. She has been diagnosed with Turners syndrome. She is not too sure if she clenches or bruxes. She has no problems with headaches. She rates her TMJ which is predominately in the right side at a level of 4 but it easily escalates up to a level of 7. Her average daily pain is about a level of 5. Jaw function is at 5, diet with chewing is 1 on the left side and 6 on the right side. Disability she rates at a level of 3.

In frontal view, B161 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is 3 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is off to the right side almost 2 mm. Chin may be about 3 mm off to the right side. In profile view she has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks and nose. The chin appears a little bit retruded by maybe 4 to 5 mm. Chin neckline is fairly well defined though a little bit short. The upper could be retruded 2 to 3 mm perhaps. Intraorally, B161 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. Appears to have adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has a Class II end-on occlusion 4 mm on the left and probably 3 mm on the right side. Oropharynx appears relatively healthy. She does have tonsils present with crypts in them and some debris present. However, they are relatively normal in size. The uvula is moderately enlarged. The soft palate appears relatively normal and faucial pillars are relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum looks fairly straight. The turbinates are fairly large and may create some airway obstruction. She is a predominately mouth breather at night when she sleeps. During the day, however, she can breathe better through her nose than she can at night. This is probably moderate nasal airway obstruction. The columella is moderately wide. The nostrils are relatively normal in size. She gives no history of snoring, daytime somnolence or sleep apnea syndromes.

B161 does have dust allergy problems. She had some nasal spray for awhile but this did not seem to make much difference. B161 also has been treated by Dr. XXXX for tongue thrush. B161 has not actually had treatment by Dr. XXXX yet but Dr. XXXX has evaluated B161 and would like to treat her. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the right styloid and moderate tenderness over the right TMJ but no tenderness around the head and neck area. Incisal opening is 40 mm. She can open about 32 mm without significant discomfort. Excursive movement to the right 5 mm, left 6 mm. When she opens, she deviates about 3 mm off to the right side. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly. Model analysis shows that she has a slight tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of probably about 2 mm. Models occlude together reasonably well with the second molar being up and out of occlusion, however. She has a slight Class II end-on cuspid relationship. Transverse plane is canted slightly with the right side about 1 to 1.5 mm higher than the left side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of all 4 third molars that are impacted and little to no room for them to erupt in. The sinuses appear relatively clear. Difficult to evaluate the condyles.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle may have a little bit of beaking anteriorly but not too significant. There appears to be fairly good joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is fairly good translation.

Right TMJ shows condyle posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is flattening on the anterior head and anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is restricted translation compared to the other side as the condyle does not quite approximate the inferior aspect of the articular eminence.

Waters view shows that the turbinates are quite large but the sinuses appear relatively clear.
Lateral cephalogram shows that she has a slight skeletal Class II occlusal relationship. She has tendency to develop an open bite. The inferior borders of the mandible line up fairly well but there is vertical discrepancy in the posterior segments in the cuspids posteriorly with one side being vertically higher than the opposite side. There is a decreased oropharyngeal airway. There is space between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall.

MRI EVALUATION:
Impression: MRI evaluation showed that she has a left TMJ articular disc dislocation with reduction but adhesions of the disc to the fossa/eminence.
TMJ arthritis, (right side greater than left side) with disc dislocation, nonreducing but adhesions of the disc to the fossa/eminence. BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Turners syndrome.
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations being worse on the right side as compared to the left
AP mandibular deficiency.
Class II end-on occlusion.
TMJ pain.
Earaches. Impacted third molars x 4.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics. Continue to align and level maxillary arch.
Continue to align mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to correct the occlusion.
Surgical removal of impacted third molars x 4. Post surgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B161 MRI Evaluation
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good medial lateral symmetry and size. There is probably a downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of maybe 2 to 3 mm at the most. There may be decreased superior joint space. The disc may be anteriorly displaced. It appears the cortical bone on top of the condyle is intact but it is difficult to visualize.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The cortical bone on top of the condyle is a little eroded in a couple of areas. Decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa probably 3 mm. The disc may be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle has some flattening on the anterior head. A little bit of anterior beaking present but not too significant. The articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced moreso at the lateral aspect less medially. Decreased superior and posterior joint spaces. Fluid in the superior joint space particularly around the articular eminence area. On opening, there appears to be relatively early reduction of the disc and moderate translation of the condyle and disc. The disc actually does not move as well. In fact, there is actually fairly movement of the disc indicative of perhaps adhesions between the disc and fossa.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little more arthritic than the other side. There is flattening on the posterior head and also in the anterior head of the condyle. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Moderate inclination of the articular eminence. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and it appears more degenerative than the opposite side. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not as much as the opposite side except at the very lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is restricted translation and the disc appears to remain nonreducing with possible adhesions to the articular eminence. The disc appears thickened significantly. It appears that there could be a little bit of erosion in the posterior head of the condyle and some anterior peaking of the condyle. The disc appears abnormally thick.

IMPRESSION
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced but with early reduction but possibly adhesions of the disc to the fossa. Right TMJ arthritis (right greater than left) and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with probable adhesions to the articular eminence.
Rule out connective tissue autoimmune disease versus ICR versus reactive arthritis. She has a closed lock on the right side.
