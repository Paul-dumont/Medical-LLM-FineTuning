B239
Meeting with Dr. _____. In review, the left TMJ itself looked normal, but with a thickened posterior band. In the right joint, there are arthritic changes with a depression in the mid part of the condyle with a significantly thickened disc. There is some fluid in the superior joint space and some altered signal between the head of the condyle and articular disc in the area of the depression. Dr. ____ could not differentiate between inflammatory process versus just fatty tissue or other type of tissue present. The condyle is broad anteroposteriorly. A depression in the mid part of the condyle is also evident.

IMPRESSION:
Relatively normal left TMJ, but with a thickened posterior band.
Right TMJ arthritic changes with a depression in the mid part of the condyle, significant thickening of the articular disc, and with some form of tissue in the erosive area on the condylar head and the disc.

Telephone conversation with ____.  ____ had many questions that he wanted to ask about the TMJ pathology and the predictability of the Mitek anchors. I told him under normal circumstances with displaced discs the Mitek anchor works very well with a highly predictable outcome. However, if the patient has connective tissue autoimmune disease or have a reactive type of arthritis in the joints, then that could affect the treatment outcome. The MRI does not bear out the pathology that is identified clinically. Clinically, she has clicking and popping in the left joint with a fairly significant opening and closing click. On the MRI, it does not look exactly the same. Also, when I saw her in November, her pain was worse on the right side than the left side. The right side functioned reasonably smoothly, but she has a deformed disc, and, in fact, the posterior band is extremely thick, although in relatively normal position. The disc could be laterally displaced. The treatment plan that we have worked for her at this time would give us the best treatment option, although I cannot guarantee that we can eliminate the pain or that the joints will be predictably eliminated of pathology and pain. I answered all the questions that he had at this time. He is to call if they have any further questions.

B239 
The patient presents for presurgical workup. Final records were taken. I did my final examination. History and physical performed. Consent form reviewed and signed. I answered all the questions she and her mother had. She is ready for surgery tomorrow. She has definite clicking in her left TMJ indicative of a displaced articular disc. On the consent form, we only have approved for a right TMJ surgery. I discussed it with her the fact that she has displaced disc on the left side as well. She agrees to proceed on and fix the left joint as well. She is ready for surgery tomorrow. B239

The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion looks good. I suctioned out her nose. She is in good spirits. She says she is getting her diet down well. No particular complaints or concerns at this time. She is progressing well and to return to see me in 2 days. I talked her about to blow her nose and she has already started doing it, although she was not supposed to.

B239
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion is fairly good. Nasal airway was suctioned. I removed sutures. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She is in good spirits. Having some discomfort and pain but not too significant. She is progressing well and to return to see me in 1 day. I answered all the questions she had today. B239
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. She is doing very well. Occlusion is good. I did add a couple of light Class II elastics. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. Splint is in place. She is going to be returning home. I sent her a drawing outlining the elastics as they are currently in place. I answered all the questions she and her mother had today. She is progressing well. I suctioned out her nose one last time. She knows how to blow her nose safely. She is progressing well. She does have a concern that it appears her upper front teeth are slightly off to the left side, but her nose is off to the right side and her upper lip is also off to the right side and more aligned with the nose than the teeth. I gave her some exercises to do to try to improve that situation. With the nose being out of position, it does hold the upper lip off more towards the right side and does increase the appearance of some asymmetry, although jaw structures seem fairly symmetric. She is to get in to see Dr. ____ this coming week. She is doing well and to return to see me in about 3 months.

B239
B239is 32 years old, referred by Dr. ___. She is in good health with no major medical problems except for her jaw situation. B239 has no trouble with headaches, but gets pain in her right jaw joint at about a level of 5 and average daily pain at 4. Jaw function and diet are at 0 and disability is at 7. She believes her TMJ problems began when she was about 12 years old, possibly from the orthodontic treatment that she had. She had a faulty crown in her 20s that caused significant problems for her for a few years. She had orthodontics from the age of 11 to 14 and then again from 14 to 16 on the upper arch including the use of head gear. She takes ibuprofen and vitamins, but really nothing else. She has no trouble with earaches, gets occasional tinnitus, but no vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching at night time.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B239 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. The maxillary midline, mandibular dental midline, and chin are pretty much on the facial midline. The maxillary midline may be 1.5 mm off to the left side as is the mandibular dental midline. The chin appears to be aligned with the lower arch. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale appears to be posterior to subnasale. The maxilla appears to be about probably 3 to 4 mm AP deficient. Chin appears to be about 12 to 15 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is fairly short, and the chin neck angle itself is fairly well defined. She has a lot of fullness in the submental area. Intraorally, B239 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, B239 has all of her posterior teeth back through the second molars present. She has pretty close to a Class I cuspid relationship, and she has an anterior open bite of probably 1 to 2 mm. She appears to have reasonable occlusion up through the second bicuspid area. The bicuspids might be a little bit out of occlusion as are all the anterior teeth. Oropharyngeal tissues all look relatively normal. The nasal airway looks relatively normal with reasonably good airway passage. To palpation, B239 has some mild tenderness over the right masseter and right medial pterygoid area. On opening, she has a click in the left joint at about 35 mm and 25 mm of closing. The right side seems to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is about 48 mm. Excursion movements are about 11 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the four third molars. She has a crown with a root canal on the mandibular right second molar. This is the tooth that gave her so much trouble through the years. The condyles appear wide anteroposteriorly. Sinuses appear clear. Roots on the incisors, both upper and lower, appear somewhat short in length. Waters view shows that she has a little cloudiness in the left sinus, but the septum appears straight and she appears to have a good nasal airway. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good shape with a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. She does have what appears to be good joint space. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears postured somewhat forward in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderate in inclination. There appears to be increased superior and posterior joint space. Her occlusion appears fairly good. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles. There is a defect seen on the head of the right condyle where there is a little void in the superior cortex. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B239 has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology with a retruded maxilla and mandible. Oropharyngeal airway surprisingly is pretty reasonable with an AP dimension of about almost 10 mm at the soft palate level and about 8 mm at the base of the tongue. She appears to have a skeletal Class I jaw relationship.

B239's diagnoses are as follows:
AP maxillary hypoplasia.
Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia.
Left TMJ articular disc dislocation.
Right TMJ arthritis and significantly increased thickness of the articular disc. Anterior openbite. High occlusal plane angle. TMJ pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align the four incisors at an elevated plane by placing a step in the arch wire. Extrude the maxillary cuspids 1 to 2 mm to get them level with the posterior teeth. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Consider slenderizing the lower anterior teeth. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ surgery for arthroplasty and to reposition the articular discs.
Maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect forward, posterior aspect inferior, level the curve of Spee, and correct any transverse discrepancies that may be present. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B239 MRI 
AGE: 32/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The condyle appears to extend slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. The disc may be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little erosive type kind of lesion in the medial portion of the top of the condyle. Joint space appears a little bit narrow on the medial side of the joint. The disc may be laterally displaced and perhaps anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that actually has fairly good shape to it. The condyle appears it may be slightly large compared to the size of the fossa. The disc appears to be in position. She has a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there appears to be good translation of the condyle and the disc with the condyle actually coming anterior to the articular eminence. The joint space appears a little bit excessive vertically and the disc, particularly the posterior band, appears a little bit thick.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a disc that is quite thick vertically. There actually is a depression in the mid part of the condyle. Out laterally, the disc has a little bit better shape is not as evident at the lateral aspect of the joint as is more medially. The condyle appears fairly broad anteroposteriorly. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is moderately good translation, although not quite as good as the opposite side. The disc appears to be in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION:
Relatively normal left TMJ, but with thickened posterior band of disc.
Right TMJ arthritic changes with a depression in the mid part of the condyle with a significantly thickened disc in the mid part of the disc.
