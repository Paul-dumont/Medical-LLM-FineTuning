B162
B162 is 27 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. His TMJ problems began when he was about 20 years old of unknown etiology. B162 does have a history of osteochondromas affecting predominantly the long bones and the hips. Six years ago, his treatment began with the use of a night guard. The following year, he had an appliance made by Dr. XXXX in Los Angeles and B162 was basically pain free. However, 13 months ago, he had a significant flare-up and began developing more clicking in his jaw joints. He has been treated with an ALF appliance which is a removable wire type expander. He also wore an appliance that postured the mandible forward at nighttime. He then was placed in a neuromuscular appliance and this has decreased the symptoms, but has not eliminated them.

B162 gets headaches in the temporal and posterior head area at about a level of 3. He rates her TMJ pain at 8 which is predominantly on the right side. He rates his average daily pain at 7, jaw function at 3, diet at 7, disability at 7. Primary concerns that B162 has at this time include the following:

Right TMJ pain.
Clicking in the jaw joints. Muscle spasms particularly in the right side of the neck.
Feeling of strain or pulling of the muscles on the right side.
Decreased mouth opening.
Teeth do not fit together and the back teeth do not touch.

B162 has no problems with earaches, gets some tinnitus, and occasional vertigo, but no hearing loss. Other joints he has had problems with include his knees and ankles. He does have some depression. He does clench and grind his teeth at nighttime.

In frontal view, B162 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 1 mm. The maxillary and mandibular dental midlines are pretty much aligned on the facial midline. The chin may be just slightly to the left 1 or 2 mm. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 2 to 3 mm. The maxilla is probably about 4 to 5 mm AP deficient. Chin is retruded about 12 mm. The chin neckline is a little bit short. He has a prominent labial mental fold. Intraorally, B162 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. He has a slight reverse curve of Wilson, but he has some slight spacing between the lower incisors. The attached gingiva is relatively thin. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars present. In centric relation, he hits only on his incisors and all other teeth are out of occlusion. He has a little expansion of the maxillary arch and has a significantly increased curve of Wilson in the upper arch. He has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship being 3 mm Class II. He has small upper lateral incisors and likely has a tooth size discrepancy. Posteriorly, he has probably about 1 or 2 mm open bite. He does have about a 2 mm anterior vertical over bite. He actually has a tendency towards a buccal cross bite. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal, at least in reference to soft palate length and uvula, but the fascial pillars are constricted and in part due to presence of tonsil tissues that are constricting that area. Intranasally, the septum is deviated off towards the right side. The turbinates are moderately enlarged. B162 has a short lingual frenulum that inhibits some of his tongue mobility. It is thin but seems to cause restriction of tongue movement. When he tries to stick his tongue out, the lateral aspects of the tongue come further forward than the midline. To palpation, he has moderate pain over the TMJs and retromandibular area and milder pain over the masseters, medial pterygoids, left SCM. Right SCM has moderate pain. Maximal incisal opening is 34 mm, but opening without discomfort 22 mm. The excursion movement to the right is 4 mm, to the left 7 mm. On opening, the joints seem to function relatively smoothly and on excursion, there was some mild crepitus in the right joint.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear, although there is some kind of body in the floor of the left maxillary sinus. The turbinates appear extremely large. It is difficult to evaluate the joints.

Coronal view shows that the septum has a little curvature off to the right side. The turbinates are quite large and appear to obliterate most of the airway. There is increased thickness of the lining in the left sinus floor. The maxillary molars are significantly over expanded and the lower teeth are slightly over expanded as well. The lower arch has a reversed curve of Wilson and the upper arch has a significantly accentuated curve of Wilson.

Axial view shows that the sinuses appear clear at the particular cut, but the turbinates are quite large and appear to obliterate most of the airway.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears almost too big for the fossa. There is anterior beaking. There is decreased posterior joint space. The disc space anteriorly appears that it would accommodate the disc, but it would be anteriorly displaced. The articular eminence is fairly steep.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some significant flattening on the head and anterior beaking present. It is not quite as far displaced posteriorly in the fossa as the opposite side. The articular eminence is moderately steep. It appears as though there may be some reactive kind of bone growing up off the posterior head of the condyle.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with a fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased vertical joint space and particularly decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ coronal view shows there is a significantly decreased lateral joint space and vertical joint space also appears decreased. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the maxilla and mandible are retruded with a moderate increased occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway dimension is about 8 mm at the tip of the soft palate and about 8 mm at the base of the tongue. He has a huge adenoid mass present with an airway of only about 4 mm between the dorsum of the soft palate and the huge adenoid mass. The turbinates appear to extend back about 2 mm above the adenoid tissue.

Basic diagnoses for B162 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with early reduction.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia but transverse hyperplasia.
Mandibular AP hyperplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion. Severely accentuated curve of Wilson in the upper arch and slight reverse curve of Wilson in the lower arch. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 5 mm.
Mild crowding of the lower anterior arch but with a diasthma between the central incisors.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Hypertrophied nasopharyngeal adenoid mass.
Nasal airway obstruction.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Ankyloglossia.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Decrease the transverse width of the maxilla and decrease the accentuated curve of Wilson. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Open up 1 mm of space between the upper laterals and cuspids to help accommodate for the significant tooth size discrepancy. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing approximately 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure and retract.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction approximately 12 mm. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward approximately 5 mm and down graft it posteriorly approximately 4 mm. d.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e.	Nasopharyngeal adenoidectomy. f.	Reconstruction of lingual frenulum with multiple Z-plasties.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B162 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. There appears to be discal tissue in position. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be discal tissue in position. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is fairly flat on the anterior aspect with a little bit of anterior beaking. The condylar head appears slightly elongated. The articular eminence is fairly steep. The articular disc appears to be in reasonably good position. The condyle appears to be postured forward slightly in the fossa. The posterior band of the disc is positioned in the mid part of the condylar head with some unexposed bone posterior to the disc. The disc appears to have reasonably good morphology. In the full closed left position, the disc appears to be slightly anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is postured forward in the fossa. In this position, the disc is in place. The articular eminence is moderate steep. There is some flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and some slight anterior beaking. In the right side in centric relation, the disc appears slightly anteriorly displaced. On opening, both discs reduced early on.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs anteriorly positioned with early reduction.
