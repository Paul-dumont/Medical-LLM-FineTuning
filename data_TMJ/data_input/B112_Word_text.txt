B112
B112 is 59 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B112's TMJ problems began when she was about 24 years old following a severe beating. She has had pain and dysfunction basically since that time and has gotten significantly worse particularly during the last 6 months. She has been in splint therapy for the past 9 years primarily with a night splint, but now since August she wears a splint day and night. She has had physical therapy on and off for the past 9 years. She currently takes the following medications:

Cymbalta 90 mg.
Armour thyroid 60 mg.
HCTZ 50 mg (for fibrocystic breast disease).
Ditropan XL for bladder control.
Vicodin 7.5 mg, usually 1 tab per day because she cannot tolerate any more than that. She basically break a tablet in half and takes a half tablet twice a day. She supplements with Advil to help control her pain.

Primary concerns that B112 has include the following:
TMJ pain. Headaches. Difficulty eating.
Significant impact on the quality of life.
Sleep disorder frequently waking up in pain. Snoring and daytime tiredness with periodic waking up and unable to catch her breath.

B112 rates her headaches that she gets 3 times a week at a level of 10 that occur in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area, being more common the right side than the left side. She rates her TMJ pain at 10, average daily pain at 10, jaw function at 5, diet at 5, and disability at 6. She gets frequent earaches, frequent tinnitus, frequent vertigo, but no hearing loss. The only other joint that really bothers her is her right shoulder. She has been diagnosed with GERD, reflux and fibrocystic breast disease. She is aware of clenching and bruxing her teeth at night and also during the day. She has severe snoring, moderate daytime somnolence, moderate sleep apnea, moderate to severe sleep disorder, and predominantly a mouth breather at night. She wakes up with a sore throat on a daily basis.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, upper lip length is 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is -1 to -2 mm. The maxillary midline is 1 mm off to the left and mandibular dental midline is 2 mm off to the right, but the chin is fairly well aligned in the midline. The mandibular right cuspid is 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid, and maxillary left cuspid is 1 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In profile, the maxilla and upper lip are retruded 3-4 mm and chin is retruded 15-18 mm. She has all of her teeth back through the second molars, but has crowns on most of the molar teeth. Her oropharyngeal tissues are relatively normal and healthy. Nasal examination shows that she has a little bow to the septum out towards the right side. At least anteriorly, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size. It does not appear, at least on anterior examination, that she has any significant nasal airway obstruction. Maximal incisal opening is 31 mm, opening without severe pain 18 mm. Excursion movement to the right is 5 mm, to the left 6 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of mandibular right first molar. The second and third molars are drifted forward with a pontic the size of a bicuspid to replace the first molar. She is missing the maxillary left first molar with a 3-unit bridge to replace it. She has a primary cuspid in the maxillary right quadrant. TMJ joints look somewhat arthritic. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Coronal view shows that there is a little bit of deviation of the septum off towards the left side. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size. Sinuses appear clear. Axial view shows that the septum is reasonably straight with just a slight deviation off towards the right side. Turbinates are relatively normal in size and sinuses are clear. Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that appears arthritic. There is some anterior beaking present. Joint space actually looks reasonably good except at the lateral aspect of the joint it appears decreased. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows the presence of some significant arthritis at the lateral aspect of the joint. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is decreased anterior joint space. The condyle is narrow anteroposteriorly but out laterally there is significant anterior beaking present. There is decreased superoposterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little flattened and appears to have lost vertical volume. There is significantly decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint but vertically in the midline and medially the joint space looks a little bit better balanced. It appears as though there is almost bone-on-bone contact at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 mm.
Right TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There may be some loss of condylar volume. It appears to be decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint and it appears there could be bone-on-bone contact there. Joint space vertically and medially appears somewhat constricted. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3-4 mm. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the maxilla and mandible are both retruded with the mandible being retruded a greater amount. There is a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 3 mm at the base of the tongue and also at the soft palate level.

Basic diagnoses for B112 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis. Maxillary AP, posterior vertical, and transverse hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia. High occlusal plane angle.
Class II end-on occlusion on the right side. Lower arch asymmetry with the right cuspid being 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid.
Missing mandibular right first molar with the second and third molar drifted forward into the first molar position.
Missing maxillary left first molar replaced by a bicuspid size pontic 3-unit bridge.
Maxillary arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being 1 mm posterior to the right cuspid.
Maxillary dental midline shifted to the left 1 mm and mandibular dental midline shifted to the right 2 mm.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of approximately 2-3 mm.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway at 3 mm (normal 11 mm).
Sleep apnea.
Severe TMJ pain. Severe headaches. Moderate to severe myofascial pain. Retained maxillary left primary cuspid.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
MRI of left and right TMJ.
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Try to shift the maxillary midline 1 mm to the right. Maintain primary cuspid at this time. Align and level mandibular arch. Remove pontic in the mandibular right first molar area. Open up space trying to shift the mandibular dental midline to the left 2 mm of its current position and advance the right cuspid forward approximately 2 mm. This should open the first molar space another 2-3 mm to equal the size of a full bicuspid crown. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them any further forward. Insert placement of a TAD in the posterior left arch to distalize the molars 1-2 mm if necessary.
CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement using TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction as well as expand. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). Bilateral coronoidotomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Restorative dentistry with consideration of placement implant in the mandibular right first molar area and a crown.
