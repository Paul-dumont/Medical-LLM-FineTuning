B375
B375 is 12 years old and referred by Dr.  .
Patient History
She may have ADD, and she does take Adderall XR 10 mg once a day, and this has significantly helped her abilities to focus. Otherwise she has no other problems. B375 does get headaches when she chews gum particularly. She also gets headaches at other times. She does tend to get headaches about three to four times per week. B375's problems began about one year ago of unknown etiology. She just began developing headaches. She rates her headaches at a level of 5, and she gets these three to four times per week primarily in the temporal areas. Chewing gum will set it off and create headaches for her. She states no pain in the TMJ area, but her overall pain levels on an average day are about at 5, jaw function at 1, diet at 0, and disability at 6.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, she has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 5 mm. Maxillary, mandibular, and chin midlines are all pretty much on the facial midline.

In profile view, she has fairly good balance between the upper lips, cheeks, and nose. Chin is retruded by probably about 15 mm. Upper lip might be just a little bit retruded by maybe about 3 mm.

Intraorally, B375 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. She has some moderate crowding, lower anterior arch. She has really thin attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has an overjet of probably about 3 mm. She has an overbite of about 2 to 3 mm. Oropharynx is clear. Uvula is moderately large. A little difficult for her to relax her tongue.

To palpation, she has mild discomfort over the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, styloids, SCMs, and milder discomfort over the posterior neck, shoulders, and medial pterygoids. TMJs actually seem to function reasonably smoothly.

Intranasally, she does have an enlarged turbinate on the right side but not so much on the left side at least anteriorly. She does have a wide columella base and narrow nostrils. She has some constricture of the luminal valves intranasally. Holding the nostrils open significantly improved her abilities to breathe through her nose. She is aware that she breathes predominantly through her mouth at night when she sleeps.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the presence of four developing but unerupted third molars with little room for them to erupt in. All other teeth are present. Sinuses look clear. Nasal airway looks reasonably good. Condyles appear a little bit flattened on the anterior surfaces bilaterally, more so on the left side as compared to the right side. No significant pathology identified.

Left TMJ tomograms show a condyle with fairly good morphology but a little bit flattened anteriorly. Appears to be decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. A little bit of anterior beaking present in one of the views.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit smaller as compared to the opposite side. Flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. Joint space looks a little bit better balanced on this side. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Opening views show good translation of the condyles bilaterally.
Panorex shows that there is a high occlusal plane angle. Appears to be a skeletal Class II relationship. Some slight anterior vertical maxillary excess and probably posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. Some adenoid tissue still remaining in the nasopharynx area. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 6 mm at the soft palate level and about 9 mm at the base of the tongue. Has hyperfunction of the mentalis muscle forcing her lips closed. B375 does snore at times when she is sleeping. The parents note that when they do go in and observe her sleeping that if she is not grinding her sleep, she is sleeping with her mouth fairly wide open. There is a tooth-size discrepancy of about 2 mm. There is also a slight tooth-size discrepancy in the bicuspid area of probably about 0.5 mm with each tooth, although this can work in our favor. With the tooth-size discrepancy, it tends to allow B375 to be in a Class I cuspid relationship, but as we get close to the molars, the molars are in a little bit more of a Class II end-on relationship.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations (rule out idiopathic condylar resorption)
Anterior vertical maxillary excess
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular deficiency
AP microgenia
Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm
Tooth-size discrepancy in the bicuspid area with the lower bicuspid being about 0.5 mm larger than the upper bicuspids
Class I cuspid relationship but Class II end-on molar relationship due to tooth-size discrepancy Moderate crowding, lower anterior arch
High occlusal plane angulation
Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4
Lack of attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch (could possible require some gingival grafting to provide quality attached gingiva) Headaches TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Wide columella base creating narrow nostrils
Constricture of intranasal luminal valves
Nasal airway obstruction
Predominant mouth breather

Recommended Treatment
Surgery, Stage I
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors
Reconstruction of columella Bilateral reconstruction of nasal luminal valves with placement of stents
Consider small chin augmentation of 5 mm

Orthodontics
Align and level maxillary arch
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 2 mm of tooth structure. Also, strip lower bicuspids removing 0.5 mm of tooth structure from each four lower bicuspids and retract maximizing posterior anchorage

Surgery, Stage II
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superiorly, posterior aspect inferiorly, and advance it
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction
Surgical removal of four bony impacted third molars

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B375 MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition:	
Date of Reading:	
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Decreased joint space at the lateral aspect. Discal tissue seen to be medially displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact over the top of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Some depression in the superior cortex. Decreased vertical joint space. Appears that there may be some discal tissue medially. Condyle must be angled significantly in three different views. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows some flattening of the anterior head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Out laterally, the disc is not as well seen. The disc is in a vertical orientation between the condyle and fossa and is displaced anteriorly. May be some inflammation in the bilaminar tissues and a little bit of fluid in the inferior joint space.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, and the disc does reduce and translates reasonably well also.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows there is significant anterior beaking of the condyle. Articular eminence is steep and extremely long in vertical length particularly out laterally. Decreased vertical joint space. Disc is anteriorly displaced particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the disc appears that it may be in a little bit better position. There does not appear to be a significant inflammatory process in this joint.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, and the disc appears to reduce on opening and also translates fairly well itself.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced with reduction
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced with reduction
