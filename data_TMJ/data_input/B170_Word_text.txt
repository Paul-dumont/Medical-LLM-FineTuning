B170
B170 is 48 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX. B170 has had a number of previous surgeries but nothing to the jaw joints.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Jaws pop and lock a lot.
Pain without medications. Locks when she has her mouth open a lot but can lock open or closed.
Overbite getting worse.

Her primary objective is to stop the pain and discomfort that she has.
CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Clarinex. Zyrtec.
Singular.
Multivitamins.
OsteoBiFlex Triple.
Bromelain. L-lysine.

She started orthodontic treatment in 8 months ago with placement of lower appliances. She got her upper appliances 5 months ago. She was under splint therapy last year. The splint did help her. But when she would take it off, her pain would get significantly worse once again. B170's problems began in about 11 years ago. She was having some endodontic work down when her jaw became locked where she could not open it or close it. Etiology was unknown. She had splint therapy last year which did help her significantly. Again, she had her braces placed 8 months ago on the lower jaw and 5 months ago on the upper jaw. About 20 years ago, everytime she went for dental work, she would be placed on Valium to avoid the locking problem. B170 gets headaches at about a level of 3 in the temple area. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 4, jaw function at 6, diet at 7, disability at 7. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus or vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her right shoulder and her right knee. She is allergic to penicillin, aspirin, erythromycin, sulfa drugs and Tequin. She also has some problems tolerating cheap earrings. She is aware of clenching and occasional bruxism at nighttime but not during the day. She feels her problems began over 40 years ago. Etiology is unknown but one of the initial dislocations occurred while she was having endodontic work done. She has had a Prolo injection done bilaterally by Dr. XXXX but this was of no benefit to her.

In frontal view, B170 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 0. Maxillary, mandibular and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, B170 may have some slight AP maxillary deficiency maybe 2 to 3 mm. Chin appears to be retruded about 10 to 12 mm. Chin-neckline is short without definition of the chin-neck angle.

Intraorally, B170 has her lower anterior teeth from first bicuspid through first bicuspid and probably her third molar is in place with crowns on them. She is missing the second bicuspids, first and second molars. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a crown on the maxillary right first molar. She has crowns on the two third molars and bottom arch. She has a Class II cuspid relationship. She has about a 4 mm anterior deep bite relationship. Oropharyngeal area looks as though the tissues are healthy with normal uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars. Tonsils are normal in size and shape. Intranasally, the septum may be deviated just slightly to the right side. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size. She has moderate snoring and some moderate daytime somnolence. She is not aware of sleep apnea problems. She does to sleep well at night and tosses and turns quite a bit. She sometimes wakes up because of the snoring. On opening, she has a definite pop in both joints with about 10 mm of opening and closing clicks bilaterally at 5 mm. To palpation she has some mild tenderness over the masseters, TMJs and styloid areas. Incisal opening is about 50 mm and she can open to about 40 without significant discomfort. Excursive movements are about 8 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of maxillary third molars, mandibular, probably second bicuspid, first and second molars and probably the third molars are in the second molar position with crowns on them. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Right condyle appears a little bit flat with some superior peaking whereas the left one looks a little bit more normal in shape.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. The bony septum appears relatively straight. The left turbinate may be a little bit large compared to the right side. Frontal sinus is quite large but appears clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis on top. It has a little bit of a hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is quite steep. The condyle is positioned against the posterior wall of the fossa with an increased anterior joint space indicative of a vertically oriented anteriorly displaced articular disc.

Right TMJ tomogram shows that the condyle may have a little bit better shape on this side. Articular eminence is quite steep. The condyle is posteriorly positioned towards the posterior wall. Increased anterior joint space compatible with anteriorly displaced articular disc in a vertical orientation. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles with appropriate space between the condyle and the articular eminence.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II relationship. Oropharyngeal airway is somewhat constricted with an airway dimension of less than 5 mm at the soft palate level and probably about 8 mm at the bases of the tongue. She has a skeletal and occlusal Class II relationship.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
AP mandibular deficiency. AP maxillary deficiency.
Slight maxillary transverse deficiency. Class II end-on occlusion.
Missing bilateral mandibular second bicuspids, first and second molars with the third molar in the second molar position. Accentuated curve of occlusion in lower arch.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 to 4 mm (normal dimension 11 mm.)
TMJ pain. Headaches.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Open up 1 mm of space between each maxillary lateral incisor and cuspid. Continue to align and level the mandibular arch.
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward 10 to 12 mm. Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla and expand it.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Surgery stage 2.
Bone grafts to mandibular body areas in preparation for osseointegrated implants.
Surgery stage 3.
Placement of osseointegrated implants in the lower arch.
Restorative dentistry to refine occlusion.

B170 MRI Evaluation
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be some decreased joint space vertically. There appears to be an erosion at the lateral aspect of the condyle in one view. It appears that there is discal tissue medial displaced. There is decreased lateral joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. There appears to be some discal tissue displaced medially. There appears to be some decreased lateral joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that towards the lateral aspect of the joint there appears to be some degenerative changes with some erosion on the posterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is very steep and almost vertical in orientation. Articular disc is in a vertical position and appears to be anteriorly displaced particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Towards the medial side it might be in a little bit better position but still vertically oriented within the fossa. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. This is not as well seen laterally as it is medially. On opening, the disc is in a reduced position and there is good translation in both the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better morphology. Articular eminence is steep but not quite as steep as the opposite side. At the lateral aspect of the joint the disc may be anteriorly displaced. The disc is not seen at the most lateral aspect of the joint. There is some medial dislocation. There is a little bit of fluid in the joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation of the articular disc and condyle with the disc in a reduced position. There is some flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and a little bit of sclerosis and a little bit of anterior beaking.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect the joint with reduction.
