B420 
B420 is 23 years old, referred by XX. The date of onset of any jaw or jaw joints problems is unknown. B420 ren states that her chin has always been retruded. She had previous orthodontics from the age of 13 to 15. Currently, she gets headaches about 3 to 4 times per week at a level of 4 in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area. She states she has no pain in the TMJ area, but average daily pain around the head and neck is at 3. Jaw function is at 3, diet at 2, disability at 2. She has no apparent trouble with earaches, but has some tinnitus and occasional vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is very much aware of clenching and bruxing at night time. She often wakes up in the mornings with headaches or at least with a pressure feeling around the head and jaw area.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B420 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 8 mm. The maxillary midline, mandibular dental midline, and chin midline are all pretty much aligned with each other. In profile view, she has may be just slightly AP deficient in the maxilla by maybe 2 mm. It appears to be about 15 to 18 mm deficient. Chin neckline is somewhat shorter and chin neck angle is moderately well defined. Intraorally, B420 has all of her teeth back to the second molars present. She has some moderate crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has some really thin attached tissue around the lower central incisors. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back to the second molars present. She has a very high arched palate. She has a slight Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally, about 3 mm Class II on the left side and 2 mm on the right side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. Both upper and lower jaw transverse Intranasally, turbinates are moderately enlarged and fairly long vertically. She appears to have adequate airway space on both sides. Luminal valves are somewhat constricted. Columella is somewhat wide and the nostrils are narrow. She probably has moderate nasal airway obstruction in part due to the turbinates, but more likely due to the narrow nostrils and restriction in the luminal valve areas. TMJs seem to function reasonably smoothly, although there seems to be a little bit of a glitch in the right joint. She had no pain to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximum opening is 55 mm. Excursion movements are about 9 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Condyles appear as though there may have been some bone resorption having occurred there in the past. She has a root canal in the maxillary left second bicuspid.
Waters view shows that the bony septum appears relatively straight. Turbinates are moderate in size. Sinuses look relatively clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears it may have undergone some bony changes in the past. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Joint space may be decreased vertically. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is actually postured forward in the fossa with an increased posterior joint space. B420 may not have been in centric relation on this x-ray. The articular eminence is relatively shallow. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically. On opening, there is moderate translation of both condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II relationship and a high occlusal plane angle. She has an anterior vertical maxillary excess and appears to have some AP microgenia. Oropharyngeal airway, however, is not too bad with the distance from the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall at about 10 mm and, at the base of the tongue, the posterior pharyngeal wall at about 6 mm. B420 has got a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 2.5 mm. The basic diagnoses for B420 would be as follows:
Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
Transverse maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
AP microgenia. Rule out TMJ pathology.
Class II end-on occlusion.
Crowding of lower anterior arch.
High occlusal plane angle. Hypertrophied turbinates.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 2.5 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
MRI of bilateral TMJs.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2.5 mm of tooth structure.
Consider turbos on the maxillary incisors and even possibly on the second molars to open the bite and aid in leveling of the maxillary and mandibular arches. Surgery. Maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxilla superiorly approximately 8 mm to decrease occlusal plane level and expand.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward in a counterclockwise direction.
Bilateral TMJ surgery, if MRI reveals TMJ pathology.
Augmentation genioplasty.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B420 MRI EVALUATION 
AGE: DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost some volume at least vertically and perhaps a little bit mediolaterally. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat. The disc is medially displaced and anteriorly displaced. There may be a small osteophyte sticking off the medial side of the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that may have lost some vertical volume. There appears to be a little sclerosis on the top of the condyle and perhaps a little osteophyte sticking up from it. There appears to be significant fluid particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim is quite flat. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some anterior beaking and flattening on top. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly. There is just a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. There may be a little roughness on the superior surface of the condyle. There is also a little sclerosis on the cortical bone. There could be a small osteophyte sticking up from the condylar head. It appears there is some inflammation in retrodiscal area. On opening, there is restricted translation with the condyle coming down the posterior slope of the eminence. The disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost some volume. There is some anterior beaking and a little bit sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderate in inclination. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly and thickened. The disc on the right side may be in slightly better condition than the left side. On opening, the condyle has restricted translation with the condyle coming down along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence. The disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated without reduction and with moderate deformation. Discs may be salvageable.
