B198
B198 is 15 years old and is referred by Dr. XXXX. B198's primary concerns affect his jaw growth because of the deformity in the right mandibular condyle. There is no real history of trauma to the joints except when B198 was in the 4th grade he came home from playing basketball one time and told his mother that his jaw hurts some but there was no indication at that time of any serious injury. The family did notice some asymmetry in the jaw alignment and took B198 to see Dr. XXXX 4 years ago. Dr. XXXX noticed the deformed condyle on the right side.

In frontal view, B198 has good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. There is some asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is 1 mm off to the right and chin midline is 4 to 5 mm off to the right. Transversely, there is a cant in the occlusion with the right side being higher by probably 2 mm in the cuspid area in the maxilla and 3 mm in the mandible. In profile view, the maxilla is AP deficient by 4 to 5 mm and chin is deficient by 15 to 18 mm. He has basically a Class I occlusion with about 2 mm anterior deep bite relationship. There does appear to be vertical overlap in the cuspid area on the right side as compared to the left side. The uvula appeared relatively normal. The soft palate may be mildly elongated and faucial pillars may be mild to moderately constricted but difficult to visualize because of limited jaw opening. On the left side the turbinate was mildly enlarged but on the right side the turbinate was moderately enlarged. The septum looked acceptable. There is mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction. No history of snoring, daytime somnolence or sleep apnea. To palpation she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, both joints seem to function relatively smoothly. He says at times he does get grinding noises in the right joint. Maximal incisal opening is 28 mm. Excursive movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 2 mm. He does not have any problems with headaches. He rates his TMJ pain at 1, average daily pain at 0, jaw function at 5, diet and disability at 0. He is not aware of clenching or bruxism.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of all the teeth except for the mandibular third molars. The maxillary third molars are impacted. There is a severely malformed condyle in the right side that could be a result of a previous fracture although there is no real strong history of that. The left joint looks relatively normal. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Waters view shows that he has a septal spur off on the right side and a rather large turbinate on the right side. On the left side it looks as though the airway is open. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have a little bit of anterior beaking. There may be a little bit of sclerosis on the head. Joint space may be a little bit thin superoposteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ tomogram shows an enlarged fossa and an enlarged condylar head but short in vertical dimension. Towards the anterosuperior aspect, there may be bone on close contact. The posterior joint space appears adequate as does the posterior aspect of the superior joint space. On opening, there is restricted translation in both joints.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the maxilla and mandible are AP deficient. The right side of the mandible is short vertically at the occlusal plane as well as the inferior border. Oropharyngeal airway, however, appears relatively normal.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Right TMJ severe deformity.
Right TMJ fibrous ankylosis. AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency. Increased occlusal plane angles.
Transverse asymmetry with the right side being significantly shorter than the left side.
Right TMJ pain.
Impacted maxillary third molars x2.
Significant limitation of jaw function. Deviated nasal septum and septal spurring.
Hypertrophied turbinates particularly on the right side. Nasal airway obstruction.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Hold treatment until the patient is 17 years old.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Right TMJ arthroplasty with probably temporal fascia or a cartilage graft.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance it, down graft it below the transverse occlusal plane.
Mandibular advancement.
Surgical removal of impacted third molars.
Nasoseptoplasty.
Turbinectomy.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
