B061
B061 is 57 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B061 was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 9. She is affected in most all of her joints. She is not aware of when the TMJ problems began. She feels that it is more recently. She had orthodontics as a teenager and apparently her bite was pretty good at that time. She then had orthodontics again in her 30s, but only on the lower arch because her teeth were crowded there and the teeth are straightened up. She does not believe that she had an open bite at that time. In her 30s, she also had a rhinoplasty and she had a chin implant. Her primary concerns are as follows:

Teeth do not fit together.
Teeth are getting crooked.
Based on B061's MRI, she has severe advanced rheumatoid arthritis of both temporomandibular joints with significant loss of condylar head and neck structure. However, she has no pain associated with the jaw joint issues, nor does she have any problems with headaches. She feels that her jaws function is at a level of 0, her diet is at 0, and disability is at 0.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B061 has fairly good facial symmetry in her middle and upper third face, but some asymmetry in the mandible. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 0. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about a 1 mm off towards the right side, and chin is probably about 5 to 6 mm off to the right side. In profile view, B061 is probably a good 6 to 8 mm AP deficient in the maxilla. The mandible is at least 20 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is extremely short and chin neck angle is poorly defined. Intraorally, she is missing the lower probably second bicuspids, but she does have third molars in place bilaterally. She has some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch and a little bit of gingival stripping. In the upper arch, she is missing probably first bicuspids and has all of her teeth back to the third molars on the right side and on the left side as well. She appears to occlude primarily on the third molars and it is possible the distal part of the second molars may touch, but the rest of the teeth are out of contact. There is about a 2 to 3 mm anterior open bite. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship. B061 does have a transverse cant in her occlusion with the left side being about 2 mm lower than the mandible and 1 to 2 mm in the maxilla. Midline of the chin may be just slightly to the right of the midline of the transverse occlusal plane. The chin implant apparently is not centered correctly on the mandible. The chin implant is off towards the right side. B061 states that immediately after the surgery she told the plastic surgeon that it was off center, but he said that was because her face was asymmetric. It is very difficult to see the oropharyngeal areas, but as best this could be seen the tissues look relatively normal and seem to have a relatively normal architecture. Intranasally, the septum is deviated off towards the right side and this seems to block most of the airway. She has a spur at the base of the septum off to the left side. The turbinates on the left side may be more normal in the size, but the one on the right side is difficult to see but may be somewhat enlarged and contributory to the significant obstruction on the right side of the nose. B061 does have pain to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 34 mm, but only about 23 mm without pain. Excursion movements were about 5 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of mandibular second bicuspids and the maxillary first bicuspids. All the rest of her teeth are present. Sinuses appear clear. She essentially has no condyles and I only see remnants of the condylar neck still remaining. She has a root canal in the mandibular left first molar. Waters view shows that the bony septum is deviated significantly off towards the right side. Left airway appears reasonably good, although there may be a spur coming off the superior aspect of the septum into the left side of the nose. Turbinate on the right side appears compressed against the lateral wall from the significantly deviated nasal septum. Sinuses appear clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows that the remnant of the condyle is functioning out of the fossa and beneath the articular eminence. It appears a new fossa has developed anterior to almost where the articular eminence would be. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is likewise postured forward and functioning on the base of the articular eminence and completely forward out of the fossa and probably 7 mm anterior to its normal position. The right side is similarly dislocated to maybe slightly a greater extent. There appears to be a little bit more resorption of the right joint in the condylar head and neck as compared to the left side. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has AP maxillary deficiency and significant AP mandibular deficiency. Oropharyngeal airway is only about 4.2 mm at the soft palate level and about 7 mm at the base of the tongue. She has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology. She has a vertical discrepancy at the occlusal plane levels and also at the inferior border of the mandible where the vertical discrepancy measures about 7 to 8 mm. At the occlusal surface, the difference is probably about 4 mm in the molar area.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Generalized rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral TMJs with severe destruction. AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Transverse maxillary hypoplasia.
Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. Anterior open bite with occlusion only on the second and third molars bilaterally. Class II end-on occlusion.
3-mm anterior open bite. Crowding of the lower anterior arch. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Deviated nasal septum.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. High occlusal plane angle.
Transverse cant in the occlusion with the right side being 1 to 2 mm higher than the left side.
Previously placed and malpositioned Silastic implant to anterior mandible.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Periodontal evaluation of particularly lower anterior arch and appropriate treatment.
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure from the anterior teeth. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward, down graft it posteriorly, and expand it. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). Bilateral coronoidotomies with bone plate stabilization.
Nasal septoplasty. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Removal of Silastic chin implant.
5. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
6. Restorative dentistry as necessary to complete the occlusion.

B061 MRI AGE: 52/F
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears anteriorly positioned in the fossa, and it appears as though the fossa has been altered and that the actual articulating area is about 8 to 10 mm anterior to the condyle's normal position, but there is almost a new fossa that appears to be generated. There is little articular eminence anterior. The condyle looks very narrow and very sclerotic. There is some kind of tissue material in the joint that evolved just behind the condyle. There is increased tissue posterior to the condyle. The condyle appears to be significantly degenerated and resorbed. There is some kind of hot spot in the articular eminence or base of the skull area and the eminence position is quite bright. I cannot really identify any evidence of discal tissue, but perhaps a little medial and anterior there may be some. It appears the condyle may have received previous surgery. The condylar head is extremely narrow anteroposteriorly.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that looks severely degenerated and there may be some increased soft tissue thickness between the rim of the condyle and the fossa. The fossa looks strange and there does not appear to be an articular eminence. The condyle must very narrow anteroposteriorly.

Right TMJ T2 shows a condyle that is significantly degenerated and appears to be superior and posteriorly positioned in the fossa. The articular eminence is malformed.

Left coronal view shows a condyle that is extremely narrow medially and laterally and degenerated. It is a little sclerotic on the top. There is joint space present however.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is extremely narrow almost to a knife edge formation. It is sclerotic up to the condylar neck and the remnant of the head. There is decreased joint space vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly maybe about 2 to 3 mm, where on the other side the fossa is laterally and superiorly flat.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ severe resorptive arthritis with essential destruction of the condylar heads and articular eminences. On the left side, there is a cystic formation in the articular eminence area that extends down into the socket area.
