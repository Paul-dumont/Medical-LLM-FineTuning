B418 
B418 is 19 years old . Referred by Dr.XX

B418's TMJ problems began when she was about 15 years old of unknown etiology. For the past 2 years, she has noted that her chin is becoming more retruded and, particularly in the last 2 months, it seems to be a little bit more progressive. She had what sounds like a night guard 2 years ago that was not particularly effective. She received a TMJ splint this year. This splint helps decrease some of her pain issues. Drs. XX made the splint. She has had chiropractic treatment including adjustments and ultrasound treatment. She gets headaches at about a level of 5 in the temporal and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 6, diet at 7, disability at 6. She takes Advil as her only medication. She has no earaches, tinnitus, gets occasional vertigo but no hearing loss. The only other joints that bother her are her lower back. She is allergic to AMOXICILLIN and SULFA. She is aware of clenching at nighttime, but does not believe she clenches during the day. She does not snore. She has some mild daytime somnolence but no sleep apnea. She is predominantly a mouth breather at night.

In frontal view, Chrsitine has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 4 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, B418 has a retruded maxilla with upper lip supralabrale being probably at least 5 mm posterior to subnasale. She is probably 6 to 8 mm AP deficient at the incisor tips and probably 15 to 18 mm AP deficiency in the chin area. Intraorally, B418 is missing the lower second bicuspids and some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has lack of attached gingiva around the right central incisor. In the upper arch, she is probably missing the first bicuspids. As she closes together, it appears that she may hit around the first molar area on the right side and then shifts into a better occlusion. She is Class II by about 3 mm on the left and 2 mm on the right. She has about a 1 mm vertical overbite. The maxillary arch appears transversely narrow particularly in the cuspid-bicuspid area. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. Oropharyngeal airway looks normal and healthy. Intranasally, turbinates are enlarged but septum is relatively straight. She probably has a moderate amount of nasal airway obstruction. Columella is slightly widened and nostrils are somewhat narrow. To palpation, she has high moderate tenderness over the left TMJ and moderate tenderness over the left masseter muscle. In jaw function, she experiences crepitus in the left joint on opening, but in both joints on excursion movements. The maximal incisal opening is 35 mm, opening without significant pain 27 mm. The excursion movement to the right is 4 mm and to the left 2 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molar, maxillary first bicuspids, mandibular second bicuspids. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appears enlarged. Both condyles appear arthritic.

Coronal view shows enlarged turbinates, but the septum appears straight and the sinuses appear clear.
Axial views show the sinuses to be clear and turbinates to be moderately enlarged.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a destructive lesion on the anterior head of the condyle. In other areas, there is beaking of the condyle and some peaking of the condyle as well. The articular eminence appears to have some erosions on the anterior aspect of it. There is decreased joint space in one of the views with the anterior aspect of the condyle and posterior aspect of the eminence. The articular eminence is relatively short in length particularly towards the medial side. There appears to be increased posterior joint space. The condyle appears small anteroposteriorly and appears to have lost vertical volume.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant degenerative changes. The condyle appears small in size anteroposteriorly and appears to have lost vertical volume. The articular eminence is slightly longer on this side compared to the opposite side. There is decreased anterior joint space. There appears to be an erosion but to a lesser extent compared to the opposite side on the anterior aspect of the condylar head.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant arthritic changes. There are erosions and significant degeneration of the cortical and subcondylar bone on the head of the condyle. There is a lateral extension however at the lateral pole that appears to be somewhat sclerotic. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 5 mm and there appears to be bone-on-bone contact with the lateral aspect of the condyle and the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost vertical volume and has some erosive areas in it. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 4 to 5 mm. There is a lateral extension of the condyle that appears somewhat sclerotic extending out almost beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a retruded maxilla and mandible and appears to occlude predominantly on the second molars. She has an anterior over jet of about 4 mm and a tendency towards an open bite. Oropharyngeal airway measures about almost 8 mm at the soft palate level and 6 to 7 mm at the base of the tongue. She has significant difficulty eating and chewing and has to eat extremely soft foods.

Basic diagnoses for B418 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis. Severe mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Maxillary AP and transverse hypoplasia. Class II end-on occlusion.
Anterior open bite tendency. Moderate crowding in lower anterior arch. High occlusal plane angle of 16 degrees (normal 8 degrees).
Missing maxillary first bicuspids and mandibular second bicuspids.
Hypertrophied turbinates causing nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain.
Headaches. Gingival recession on mandibular right incisor.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Periodontal evaluation and gingival grafting lower anterior arch.
2.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Consider slenderizing the lower anterior teeth removing about 1 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them too far forward.
3.	CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
4.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement of about 16 mm at pogonion using TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.	Bilateral coronoidotomies. e.	Bilateral partial turbinectomies.
5.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

DATE OF INTERPRETATION:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that seems to have lost some volume. There appears to be reasonably good vertical joint space, but the disc appears to be more anteriorly and perhaps laterally displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that may have lost some vertical volume. Difficult to see any discal present, although it appears it may be anteriorly displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe arthritic changes. There appears to be some bony erosion occurring particularly on the anterior head of the condyle. The disc is hard to identify and appears degenerated. There is increased posterior joint space. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There appear to be some areas on the articular eminence that are eroded. The disc appears significantly degenerated and posterior band is thickened but hot areas within the posterior band. On opening, there is significantly limited translation.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some anterior beaking. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced and appears significantly degenerated. There is a hot spot in the head of the condyle on the superior surface. On opening, there is limited translation of the condyle. There is a hot spot in the soft tissues superior and posterior to the condyle on opening.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ destructive arthritis with degeneration of the articular discs.
