B528
B528 is 17 years old. B528 was referred by XXXX. B528's orthodontist is Dr. XXXX.

Patient Concerns
The primary concerns that B528 has are as follows:
His teeth don't fit together properly, and his jaws are not properly aligned
Difficulties eating and chewing
Popping in the jaws
Pain in the jaw joints
Snoring
Difficulties breathing through the nose

Patient History
B528 has had some previous surgery including correction of his deviated nasal septum, and he has had his tonsils taken out as well as eight teeth pulled. B528 has had some previous orthodontic treatment which began somewhere around the age of 12 or so where he apparently wore a growth appliance to try to grow the mandible. He then was in braces for 2-1/2 years and apparently still has some significant occlusal problems. The first treatment was performed by Dr. XXXX. B528 then ended up to see Dr. XXXX, who suggested pulling four bicuspid teeth.

B528 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. He has no problems with headaches. He rates his TMJ pain about a level of 2. He rates his jaw function at 5, diet at 2, and disability at 0.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B528 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is probably about 3 to 3.5 mm. Maxillary dental midline, mandibular dental midline, and chin midline are all pretty well aligned to the facial midline.

In profile view, he has some slight AP maxillary deficiency of probably 3 to 4 mm. Mandible is retruded probably fairly close to 20 mm. Intraorally, B528 is missing the lower first bicuspids and upper first bicuspids. Teeth are becoming fairly well aligned and leveled. Has adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. He has essentially a full Class II cuspid-molar relationship. He has an overjet of probably about 7 to 8 mm. He has a vertical overbite of about 2.5 to 3 mm. B528 has no particular pain around the head and neck area by palpation, although he has a little bit of soreness in the shoulders that he relates to his golf game. On opening, he has some type of noises in the joints that may be indicative of displaced discs perhaps medially and slightly anteriorly. Incisal opening is about 46 mm. Excursive movements are about 9 mm in each direction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of four first bicuspids and all four third molars. Turbinate in the right side of the nose is huge. Left side also is large. Septal spur can be seen coming off the left side of the septum. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Condyles look like there may be some changes there. No other significant problems noted.

Right TMJ tomograms show a condyle that looks small anteroposteriorly, and, in fact, is extremely narrow. It sits posterior in the fossa indicative of probably anterior articular disc dislocations. Articular eminences are moderately steep. Condyles are unusually narrow.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have a pseudocyst in the head. It sits back all the way against the posterior fossa wall. Articular eminence is significantly steeper on this side as compared to the other side. Increased anterior joint space. Probable vertical inclination of the articular disc.

Opening views show moderate translation of both joints.
Waters view shows that the sinuses are fairly clear, and he has huge frontal sinuses. The turbinate on the right side is extremely large and totally obliterates the nasal airway, where on the left side, he does have some airway.

Cephalometrically, B528 has AP maxillary deficiency and significant AP mandibular deficiency. He is full Class II skeletal and dental malocclusion. He has some adenoid tissue up in his nasopharynx that may be blocking some of the airway there as well. Oropharyngeal airway is constricted with the measurement of only about 3 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue about 4 mm. Also has a high occlusal plane angle jaw relationship. There is a tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 1 mm. B528 does have some daytime somnolence.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reductions
AP maxillary deficiency
Transverse maxillary deficiency
Severe AP mandibular deficiency
Class II malocclusion
Accentuated curve of occlusion, lower arch
Missing four bicuspids from extractions from orthodontic purposes and also the four third molars have been removed
Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of approximately 1 to 2 mm
Hypertrophied turbinates
Hypertrophied adenoid tissue in the nasopharynx
Nasal airway obstruction
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 to 4 mm (normal 11 mm)
TMJ pain
Snoring
Sleep apnea symptoms

Recommended Treatment
MRI of left and right TMJs
Presurgical orthodontics
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Open up a little bit of space around each of the upper laterally incisors to account for the small tooth-size discrepancy. Probably need only about 0.5 mm around each lateral incisor
Continue to align and level mandibular arch.
Consider using a bite plate on the upper arch so that the lower teeth touch only at their incisor and second molar areas so that the mid buccal teeth could be extruded and leveled. Another option would be just to wait until postsurgery and level the lower arch at that time with extrusion of the mandibular mid buccal teeth

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward, move it up anteriorly slightly, and downward posteriorly as well as expand it
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible approximately 18 mm Partial turbinectomies
Nasopharyngeal adenoidectomy

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
Pontic to upper laterally incisors if necessary to fill in the residual spacing created for the tooth-size discrepancy correction

B528 MRI Evaluation
Images aren't the greatest probably because of metal artifact from his braces.
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit narrow in transverse width. There may be a slightly decreased joint space. Appears there may be some discal tissue anteromedially. Lateral rim of the fossa has a moderate downward curvature. Difficult to tell if the cortical bone is intact on the head of the condyle. Roof of the fossa is quite thin.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with perhaps some slight decreased transverse width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves moderately inferiorly. Joint space could be a little bit narrow but difficult to tell. Appears there may be some discal tissue medially but again difficult to determine.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit small in size. Articular eminence is quite long vertically and quite steep. Cortical bone appears to be intact in the fossa and articular eminence as well as on the condyle. Anterior head of the condyle is a little bit flattened, and there is some mild anterior beaking present. Posterior joint space appears decreased. Anterior joint space is significantly increased. Articular disc is in a vertical orientation within the fossa and acting as a wedge, pushing the condyle posteriorly. There is no discal tissue directly above the condyle particularly at the more lateral aspect. The condyle is narrow mediolaterally and is only seen in three views. There is some fluid in the superior joint space but no significant inflammatory process seen. Out laterally, there is a large amount of fluid beneath the articular eminence. Disc appears to be in good condition, although it is quite thick and is salvageable.

On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, and the disc appears to reduce on opening. Both condyle and disc appear to translate well.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is very narrow anteroposteriorly and more deformed than the opposite side. In the mid part of the condyle, it is extremely narrow anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is quite steep vertically and long in a vertical direction as well, particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint, and it is a little bit shallow toward the most medial aspect of the fossa. Condylar bone appears to be quite arthritic as compared to the opposite side. There is some anterior beaking present particularly out laterally. Cortical bone in the fossa appears to be intact. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced, and the posterior band is quite thickened. There is fluid in the superior joint space and perhaps some reactive tissue in the joint space as well, particularly out laterally. Out laterally, there appears to be some fluid underneath the articular eminence.

On opening, there is fairly good translation although not as good as the opposite side, and it appears that the disc is non-reducing. The disc is quite thickened in the posterior band and for the most part sits beneath the articular eminence. However, I believe that there is enough discal material there to salvage.

Impression:
1.	Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction.
2.	Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.
