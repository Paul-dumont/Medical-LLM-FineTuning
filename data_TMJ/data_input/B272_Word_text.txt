Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width, although it may be slightly narrow. There may be a lateral extension at the lateral pole in one area. There appears to be discal tissue displaced laterally and perhaps anteriorly. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 4 mm. The superior joint space may be just slightly decreased.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a similar morphology than the other side. It is slightly narrow, but with a little lateral extension of the lateral pole. Joint space vertically appears it may be slightly narrow. There appears to be discal space out laterally and anteriorly.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle has anterior beaking present. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminence is fairly steep and elongated vertically. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is somewhat short anteroposteriorly, although it still appears relatively thin. There may be discal tissue out laterally as well. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle. The articular disc remains anteriorly and laterally displaced and appears more deformed in the open views, being short anteroposteriorly and with loss of the intermediate zone. The disc remains sitting beneath the articular eminence. Translation is significantly limited.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a very similar kind of morphology except there is a larger anterior beaking on the condyle present, and the articular eminence is not quite as steep. The articular disc is anteriorly and laterally displaced. Joint space looks reasonably good. Right TMJ open view shows likewise a condyle with restricted translation, and the disc remains anteriorly and laterally displaced without reduction. The disc remains beneath the articular eminence. The disc appears short anteroposteriorly. Anterior beaking is quite evident on the condyle.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and laterally dislocated without reduction with significant degenerative changes with probable adhesions to the articular eminences.

B272 
B272 is 29 years old. Referred by Dr. __ .
B272's TMJ problems began when she was about 12 years of age when she was kicked in the jaw by her brother who was 2 years old at the time. Her jaw began clicking and popping after that. However, it was not until this year that she began developing pain and discomfort.

B272 has had previous orthodontics from the age of 15 to 17. At the end of the treatment, her bite fit together well and her midlines were straight and she states she had a normal Class I occlusion. She has orthodontic retainers and she actually ground through 3 sets of those until her problems began to escalate this year. B272's bite began to open anteriorly after she had her baby which was this year . B272 believes her bite opened to its current state about 6 months to a year after the baby was born. She does not feel that the problem has gotten worse for the past year and she does not believe the open bite has gotten any worse.

B272 has no problems with headaches. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 4, diet at 5, disability at 5. She takes no medications. She has no earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at night time and also clenching during the day. She chews predominantly on the right side as this creates less pain for her when chewing. A year ago she had a feeling that her lower jaw was unattached from her face. She feels as though she has to hold her mouth closed to play with her child as she is afraid that any trauma to the jaw would be extremely painful for her. Primary concerns that B272 has include the following:
Teeth do not fit together.
Chewing causes pain.
Anterior open bite.
Since this year, she has had 2 splints made, but one has helped her be pretty comfortable. This splint opens the bite slightly, but most of the teeth touch during function.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B272 has fairly good facial symmetry with just some slight increased fullness on the right side of the face as compared to the left side in the ramus area by probably 3 mm. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The right eye may be about 2 mm higher than the left one. She has about 6 mm of lip incompetence. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is shifted to the left about 1 mm and the chin is probably about 3 mm to the left. In profile view, B272 appears to have fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. The lower jaw appears retruded and the chin neckline is short and not well defined. The mandible appears to be retruded by about 10-12 mm. The lower third face appears a little bit long likely due to the open bite and downward and backward rotation of the mandible. Intraorally, B272 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. The teeth appear nicely aligned and leveled. Gingiva looks healthy. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an anterior open bite of about 4 mm. She has a Class III end-on cuspid relationship bilaterally, being worse on the left side. In centric relation, she occludes only on the right second molars. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal. Intranasally, turbinates appear moderate in size. It be causing a little bit of nasal airway obstruction. Maximal incisal opening is 40 mm and that is without pain. Excursion movements are about 10 mm in each direction. On opening, she may have a click or pop in the right joint at about 20 mm of opening and at 3 mm of closing, but difficult to tell. The left joint seemed fairly smooth. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the left temporalis muscle and right retromandibular muscle.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Joints appear arthritic. Turbinates appear moderate in size, but sinuses appear relatively clear. She appears to hit on the right second molars and all other teeth appear to be out of occlusion. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic and appears to have lost vertical volume. There is anterior beaking present. A little bit of sclerosis and a little bit of roughness on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has lost more condylar volume and has some peaking at the posterior head of the condyle and anterior beaking with the in between areas quite flattened. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat degenerated. There is a small pseudocyst in the medial portion on the head of the condyle. Joint space looks reasonably good. Left TMJ view shows good joint space, but decrease lateral joint space. The condyle is a little bit narrow mediolaterally. Right TMJ shows that there appears to be erosion across the mid portion of the condyle. There is definite loss of bony cortex. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a fairly high occlusal plane angle in the mandible. She is AP mandibular deficient. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 5 mm at the base of the tongue and 6 mm at the soft palate area. Hand manipulation of her dental models puts her back into fairly good Class I cuspid-molar relationship with about 1 mm of vertical overbite and the midline is reasonably well aligned.

Diagnoses for B272 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis and articular disc dislocated without reduction and severe deformation. AP mandibular hypoplasia.
Anterior open bite. Class II occlusion. Occluding only on the right second molars with all other teeth out of occlusion. Apertognathia extending from and including the right first molars through the left second molars.
TMJ pain.
Decrease oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 5 mm (normal dimension 11 mm).

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
