B267 
B267 was referred by Dr. __.
Patient History
B267 is 38 years old. She has had a previous laparoscopy but no other surgeries. She used to have lots of allergy problems as a child but has outgrown some of those but occasionally will have problems with allergies now. She used to have rashes on her fingers, and that has gotten better as she has gotten older. Currently she has a rash on her back. The rash on her back has been there about a month. She apparently had a rash two or three years ago on her hands about the same time that she developed her TMJ problem. A couple of weeks ago she had a rash around her eyes, cheeks, and bridge of the nose area. It went away on its own. About 10 days or two weeks ago, she did develop some kind of hive kind of situation on her hip and buttock area on both sides. She is allergic to cats and horses.

The problems began 2 years ago. She became aware that her back teeth were sore. Over the next three months, her bite opened anteriorly but then stabilized. Her bite opened in the front. She did get a bite guard last year, and she has been stable since then. She rates her headaches at 0, TMJ pain at 0, overall facial pain at 0, jaw function at 0, diet at 1, and disability at 0. She currently takes no medications. B267 did have previous orthodontics at about the age of 7 for an underbite.

The only injury-related occurrence that B267 can remember is in September she hit her head pretty hard getting into the car and saw some stars, although she was not knocked out. Prior to the onset of the change in the bite, she did have a cold. She also had a cold about the same time as the joint problems began. She doesn't believe that it turned into a bronchitis or pneumonia.

B267 did bring some photographs from the age of 7. It shows that she may have had just a slight facial asymmetry at that time. She also has a picture of a little bit of a diagonal view from 1979 when she was 14 years old, and it appears she might have had just a slight cant in the occlusion at that time as well but difficult to say. Her bite was together at that time.

Patient Concerns
Teeth don't fit together properly
Bite is off
Speech is affected
Difficulty eating some foods
Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B267 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is probably 1. Maxillary and mandibular dental midlines are pretty much on the facial midline. Chin is shifted a little bit off to the right side probably about 3 mm. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are pretty much aligned with each other if the transverse cant is taken into consideration.

In profile, B267 has fairly good facial balance. Chin-neckline is relatively normal, and chin-neck angle is fairly well-defined. Slight acute nasolabial angle due to just some slight nasal tip ptosis.

Intraorally, B267 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Teeth are fairly well-aligned and leveled. Just a little malrotation on the right side with a central, lateral incisor, and cuspid.

In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. In centric relation, she occludes primarily on just the right second molars. All the rest of the teeth are out of occlusion. She can bite down harder and get the back teeth on the left side to touch as well. She has a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being about 2 mm elevated compared to the left side. Oropharynx appears clear. She does have some crenations around the lateral borders of her tongue. She is not aware of having any breathing difficulties with her nose. She has about a 2 to 3-mm anterior open bite in her centric relation. In centric relation, she does hit just on the second molars on that right side. She is slight Class II end-on occlusion in that position by about 2 mm. She has an overjet of probably about 1 to 2 mm. A little bit of crowding in the upper anterior arch. She has a little bit of a crepitus kind of sound in the right joint that she hears on opening and also excursive movements. No tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximum incisal opening is 48 mm. Excursive movements to the right are 4 mm and to the left 7 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Nasal septum if difficult to identify. Airway on the left side does not appear as open as the right side. Missing all four third molars. May have some short roots on the maxillary incisors. Condyles seem to have fairly good size to them.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates are moderate in size. A little bit greater nasal airway on the right side as compared to the left side. The left side of the maxilla and mandible seem to be a little bit longer vertically than the right side.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that is a little flattened on top. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Good joint space all around the condyle. Bite on the left side appears to be open in the molar area. A little sclerosis across the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that shows a little bit of flattening on the superior head. Joint space actually looks reasonably good. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Teeth are apart on this side as the bite was not together when the x-ray was taken.

Opening view shows good translation of both joints.
Cephalometrically, she has an anterior open bite and basically a skeletal Class I kind of jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks relatively normal.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation in a medial direction and arthritic changes in the condyles particularly at the lateral aspect
Apertognathia
AP mandibular deficiency and asymmetry
Maxillary transverse asymmetry
Cant in the occlusion with the right side being 2 mm higher than the left side
Class II occlusion Occluding only on the right second molars and all other teeth out of occlusion
Changes in speech
Rule out bilateral TMJ reactive arthritis versus psoriatic arthritis

Recommended Treatment
Chlamydia and Mycoplasma antibody titer test
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal osteotomies to close the anterior open bite
Consider maxillary osteotomies if the patient elects to have the transverse asymmetry corrected

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
I gave her a prescription for blood tests:
Chlamydia antibody titer for pneumoniae, psittaci, and trachomatis Mycoplasma antibody group including pneumoniae, genitalium, and fermentans

Discussed with them all their treatment options. I told them that most surgeons would recommend not doing the TMJ, but in my experience with displaced discs in the joints that if orthognathic surgery only is done, she has a significant probability of developing TMJ pain and headaches. I also gave her the options for the orthognathic surgery portion which includes doing the mandible only, doing the maxilla only, or doing both jaws to also correct the transverse asymmetry. This can all be done at one time. Although B267 has some history of getting some rashes, she has no pitting of her nails and no involvement of other joints. Except for having a cold at the time of onset of her problems last year, she presents with no other factors that would tend to lead one to the presumption that her condition was caused by psoriatic arthritis.

B267  MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition:	
Date of Reading: 
Age: 38-year-old female
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Relatively minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Decreased lateral joint space. Articular disc is seen to be medially displaced. Out laterally, the disc may be anteriorly displaced but definitely has a medial displacement with about half the condylar head covered by disc.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral pole of the condyle appears to have contact with the lateral rim of the fossa. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa and is slightly greater than the opposite side. Disc appears to be medially displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some flattening of the condyle at the lateral aspect. Disc is not seen out laterally, but more medially it appears to be in position. A little sclerosis on the head of the condyle toward the medial side but not too bad. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. No significant inflammatory response around the joint. It appears that there is some erosion of the bone at the lateral aspect of the condyle. Appears to be a little osteophyte sticking out and a little anterior beaking present. Could be a protrusion off the posterior aspect of the condylar head as well as is consistent on through the films toward the medial side.

On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and articular disc. Out laterally, the disc is difficult to see and essentially nonexistent compatible with the medial displacement. More medially, the disc is in proper position and translates fairly well.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, out laterally the disc is not evident. As the medial sides approach, the disc becomes visible. The disc appears to be in good position. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not too much. No particular inflammatory process seen.

On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle. More laterally, the disc is difficult to see, but more medially the disc appears to translate well with the condyle and appears to be in a reduced position.
