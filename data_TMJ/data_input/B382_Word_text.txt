B382 
B382 is 45 years old and referred by Dr.  .
Patient History
B382 is in good health. She had herpes encephalitis and spent 14 days in the hospital last year. The only surgery she had was she had the fallopian tubes cut to prevent pregnancy.

B382's problems as best as she can recall began about two to three years ago. She developed pain on the right side of her jaws in what appears would have been her maxillary and mandibular first molars. Her dentist at that time changed out the restorations from amalgams to a composite. She continued to have significant problems with those teeth and apparently facial swelling. She was put on a number of different antibiotics, but it wouldn't clear. Finally she had those two teeth extracted, and those teeth have been replaced with bridgework. She also had some root canals done on some adjacent teeth in those areas, and apparently root canal treatment was also attempted on the molar teeth as well.

She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, or vertigo. She has no problems with headaches. She is not sure of her TMJ pain, but it could be around 5, and she gets facial pain. Her pain is predominantly on the left side, and she rates it at a level of 5, but it can escalate to 10. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 6, and disability at 4. No other joints bother her except her neck can make noise at times. She probably has nocturnal clenching and bruxism, and her pain is worse in the mornings when she wakes up. She apparently tried a new brand of toothpaste. In December of last year, she tried a new type of toothpaste that says you are only supposed to use it twice a day, but she normally brushes her teeth four to five times per day. Apparently she had a reaction to it. She then bought some Colgate toothpaste, and apparently it had the same chemical in it, and she had a reaction to it as well and apparently had a lot of swelling and erythematous changes associated with her gums. She stopped the toothpaste, and the problem cleared. She has no known problems with wearing jewelry.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B382 has good facial balance.
Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars except she has a bridge on the right side to replace the first molar. She has mild crowding in the lower anterior arch but has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars except she has a pontic replacing the missing maxillary right first molar. She has pretty much a Class I cuspid-molar relationship just with the crowding anteriorly, being greater in the lower arch than the upper arch.

To palpation, she has some minimal tenderness over the temporalis muscle but really no tenderness around the rest of the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is about 44 mm but only 35 without significant discomfort. Excursive movement to the right is 8 mm and to the left 10 mm. On opening and closing as well as excursive movements, she has audible crepitation in the right TMJ area.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the sinuses look reasonably clear. Turbinates are moderate in size. Missing maxillary and mandibular right first molars replaced by pontics. Appear to be some arthritic changes in the condyles with the right one having a significant anterior beaking component and the left side having more flattening in the anterior head and anterior beaking as well.

Right TMJ tomogram shows that there is some significant anterior beaking and decreased anterior joint space. Perhaps some sclerosis on the head of the condyle and sclerosis on the articular eminence. Articular eminence is moderately steep. May be some decreased posterior joint space. Superior joint space could be a little bit decreased but not too significantly.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit smaller than the opposite side, but there is anterior beaking present and decreased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Could be some sclerosis in the articular eminence. Posterior joint space and superior joint space actually look a little bit better than the opposite side.

On opening, there is moderate translation of both joints. Significant anterior beaking and deformity of the right condyle is noted, and the left condyle looks as though it has had some degenerative changes associated with it also.

On the right side, there appears to be decreased joint space in the open view. On the left side, the space seems a little bit greater, although the arthritis appears may be a little bit more involved on that side.

Waters view shows that the sinuses have about equal radiolucency in the maxillary area. Other sinuses appear relatively clear. Right turbinate may be just slightly enlarged. A little bit of deviation of the nasal septum. Mastoid areas are well-aerated and large.

Cephalometrically, she has a skeletal Class I jaw position. Has good oropharyngeal airway.
Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ severe osteoarthritis and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and nonsalvageable
TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Pain in the teeth
Nocturnal clenching and bruxism

Recommended Treatment
Medications
Klonopin 0.5 mg, 1 tablet q.h.s. to try to decrease or eliminate the nocturnal clenching and bruxism
CT scan of TMJs (TMJ Concepts protocol)

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ condylectomies, debridement, and reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts
Application of arch bars to control occlusion during surgery and after

I did give her a prescription for Klonopin 0.5 mg tablets, disp. 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x 1. In addition, I reviewed the potential risks and complications with her including everything from infection, bleeding problems, facial nerve paralysis, etc.

Other Systems
She has questionable problems with the bones in her neck. She has had an occasional urinary tract infection. She states she has polyuria and nocturia x 1. She has one son, age 26, and has no miscarriages and no fertility problems. No other female system problems. She has gotten occasional vaginal yeast infections in the past but in the last five years the vaginal infections may occur as frequently as two to three times per year. She gives no history of Chlamydia. She has some fatigue but associates it mainly with the pain that she is currently having. She does have a history of herpes encephalitis. She has no exposure to birds, cats, or hoofed animals. She did have one dog at one time that used to catch squirrels, but she is not aware of his catching birds.

B382 MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of :
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Bone in the condyle doesn't appear quite a smooth as usual. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim, and, in fact, it is actually quite flat. Appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Fossa appears to be intact. Decreased vertical joint space present.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width, and the condyle actually looks a little bit more healthy than the opposite side. However, there is a decreased vertical joint space. Appears the discal tissue is anterior to the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa is relatively flat although a little bit more downward curvature than the opposite side.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Decreased superior joint space particularly toward the anterior aspect of the condylar head. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed, being very short anteroposteriorly. Could possibly be a perforation in this joint. No particular inflammation seen around the joint. Disc is sitting beneath the articular eminence.

On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the articular disc, but the articular disc is nonreducing.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. Some anterior beaking present. Condyle is narrow over medially and wider out laterally. Decreased vertical joint space. Posterior joint space is narrowed also. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Articular eminence does not look quite a smooth as one would expect. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced without reduction. May be a little bit of fluid in the joint spaces. Presentation of both these joints makes it appear as though there may have been previous surgery performed here where there is some kind of destructive process going on. The fossa on the right side does not appear very smooth.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and fairly significant deformation. Questionable salvageability
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with significant deformation. Disc may be nonsalvageable
