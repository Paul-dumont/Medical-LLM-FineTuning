B521
B521 is 42 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX.
Patient History

She had a tonsillectomy 31 years ago and had a discectomy of C6-C7 6 years ago. She had half of her thyroid gland removed, and she has some arthritis in her jaws. She doesn't take any specific medications now except occasionally Advil. She has had an adverse reaction to CODEINE. She says the problems began about 12 years old where she was clicking and then locked open. Since then she has had sort of a downhill spiral. Her bite has gotten continuously worse. She has worn splints for about seven or eight years. She gets massages weekly. The only medicine she takes is Advil occasionally for her pain. She has no trouble with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her neck and her knees. She is aware of occasionally clenching during the day but not at night. She rates her headaches that she gets about two times a week at about a level of 8 in the temporal and posterior head area. Rates her TMJ pain which is fairly constant at an average of 6 and at worst it gets to a 9. Average daily pain is about a 5. Rates her jaw function at 8, diet at 7, and disability at 7.

She does have some mild snoring. She is tired a lot during the day. She does wake up at times unable to catch her breath.
Patient Concerns
Headaches
TMJ pain
Difficulties eating and chewing
Bite continuing to shift and move
Chronic biting of cheeks and tongue because of the jaw and dental malalignment
Continuing and progressive retrusion of the lower jaw

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B521 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1.5 to 2 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Nasal tip is a little bit off to the right side about 2 to 3 mm. Mandibular dental midline is about a millimeter off to the left but actually fairly close to the facial midline. Actually maxillary and mandibular midlines are just slightly off to the left about a millimeter as is the chin.

In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 2 to 3 mm. Maxilla is probably about 4 to 5 mm AP deficient. Chin is probably 15 to 18 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline is extremely short, and chin-neck angle is very poorly defined. A line goes from her chin point straight down toward her neck.

Intraorally, B521 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Has some significant crowding, lower anterior arch. Some lower arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being probably a millimeter posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, B521 has all of her upper teeth back through the second molars. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship being a little bit worse on the left side than the right side. She has an open bite tendency. In centric relation, she hits only on the right second molars with the rest of the teeth out of occlusion. Oropharynx appears clear. Uvula is normal in size. Soft palate looks relatively normal, and the width of the faucial pillars is relatively normal.

Intranasally, the nasal septum is deviated significantly off toward the left side. Turbinates have fairly significant hyperplasia. However, on the right side, the airway is still open because of the deviated septum off toward the left. On the left side, the turbinate appears to be touching against the nasal septum, so she probably has severe obstruction on the left side.

To palpation, she has high moderate to low severe pain over the TMJs and styloid areas being a little bit greater on the right side than the left side. Also, she has high moderate pain to palpation over the temporalis and masseter muscles on the right side only. She gets headaches about two times per week at about a level of 8 in the temporal and posterior head areas. She rates her TMJ pain, which is rather constant, at about a level of 6 and it gets up to a 9. She rates her average head and neck pain at a level of 5, jaw function at 8, diet at 7, and disability at 7.

On opening, she has a little crepitus, but there appears to be an opening click at somewhere around 20 to 25 m of opening and closing click at probably about 10 mm. On the right side she doesn't hear much noise over there now. Has a little bit of crepitus on the right side. Maximal incisal opening is 35 mm but without significant pain only about 25 mm. Excursive movements to the right are 5 mm and to the left 9 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the sinuses appear relatively clear. Missing all four third molars. Root canal in the maxillary right cuspid. Turbinates appear moderately large. Right condyle is extremely flattened with significant loss of vertical height of both the condyle and the articular eminence. Left side cannot make out the top of the condyle on the Panorex.

Left TMJ closed tomogram shows a condyle that has undergone some significant arthritic changes with loss of vertical height. Some anterior beaking is present. Significantly decreased joint space vertically and posteriorly as well as anteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ closed tomogram shows a condyle that has undergone significant degenerative changes with loss of vertical height and appears narrow anteroposteriorly similar to the opposite side. Significantly decreased superior and posterior joint spaces. Articular eminence appears a little bit more shallow on this side than the opposite side.

On opening, there is some fairly good translation of both condyles. Small size of both condyles is quite evident on the open views.
Waters view shows that the septum is significantly deviated off toward the left side. The right turbinate is extremely large and appears to obliterate most of the airway on that side. Left side also appears to have an obliterated airway. Both bone and cartilage must be involved.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows AP maxillary deficiency, posterior vertical maxillary deficiency, and a significant AP mandibular deficiency with almost a full Class II occlusal and jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 3 mm at the base of the tongue and about 4 mm at the base of the soft palate.

On dental model analysis, right maxillary central incisor is significantly wider than the left central incisor. Tooth-size discrepancy is about 0.5 to 1 mm.

Severely deviated nasal septum
Hypertrophied turbinates
Nasal airway obstruction

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies in case they are require
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing at least a millimeter of tooth structure to keep from flaring them any further forward and to help correct for the tooth-size discrepancy

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvested from the abdomen)
Bilateral coronoidectomies Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction and correct any transverse or vertical problems that may be present
Partial turbinectomies
Nasal septoplasty

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion

Date of Reading:

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is quite small in size with obvious evidence of loss of vertical and transverse dimension. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a fairly significant amount, probably 3 to 4 mm. Appears to be discal tissue medially to the condyle. Fossa appears to be intact. A lot of sclerosis in the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is narrow mediolaterally but maybe not quite as narrow as the opposite side. There is lateral beaking of the condyle. Decreased vertical joint space similar to the opposite side where there is also decreased vertical joint space. Condyle appears more irregular on the right side. Less of a downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa with only maybe 2 mm. Appears to be some irregularity in the fossa surface although it appears to be intact.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with a lot of sclerosis on it. The condyle appears to have lost vertical height. Some anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced but significantly narrowed anteroposteriorly. Posterior band appears thick. Though clinically the disc appears to reduce on opening, the disc appears to remain anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has lost significant anteroposterior and particularly vertical height. A little bit of anterior beaking present. Difficult to identify discal tissue, although there may be some residual beneath the articular eminence. Appear that there may be some irregularities in the fossa area. Significantly decreased vertical joint space.

On opening, there is fairly good translation, but any remnant of the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Impression:
Left TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and nonreducing
Right TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc severely degenerated and nonreducing
