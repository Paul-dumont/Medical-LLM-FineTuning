B177
B177 is 16 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX and also has been referred by Dr. XXXX, DMD. B177 apparently had a fall when he was 3 to 4 years old and may have had a fracture of the upper jaw. He subsequently has been under orthodontic treatment. He was under Class III face mask treatment through UCLA and Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX and had that treatment twice during the ages of 5 to 8. He has had several maxillary expanders performed also at UCLA and by Dr. XXXX. He has been in orthodontic appliances since about the second grade and continues with those appliances. B177 has no problems with headaches, no TMJ pain or myofascial pain. Jaw function, diet, and disability are all at 0. There are no earaches, but he gets occasional tenderness and occasional vertigo. The other joints that both him include his left elbow and his lower back. B177 is a wrestler and these joints may be affected by that. He is unaware of clenching or bruxism. He takes no medications except for some topical.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B177 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the right side. In profile view, B177 appears to have good balance between the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. The mandible appears somewhat strong. The lower third face appears somewhat elongated. The chin neckline appears elongated, although the chin neck angle is well defined. Intraorally, B177 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars present. There is a little bit of space between the lower anterior teeth, particularly the lower incisors which may be a little bit small in size. In the upper arch, B177 has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has just a slight Class III relationship on the right side by probably 1 to 2 mm and on the left side by probably 2 to 3 mm. He has an anterior cross bite with a vertical overbite of about 1 mm. He has a tendency towards a posterior cross bite. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. Tonsils are moderately enlarged and fascial pillars are mild to moderately constricted. Intranasally, the left turbinate appears enlarged, but the right side appears relatively normal. The right side appears fairly open, at least in the anterior portion. The septum may be deviated a little bit off towards the left side. The columella is fairly wide.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of four impacted third molars. All other teeth are present. The neck of the condyles appear somewhat elongated. Left TMJ tomogram shows that there appears to be decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminences are moderately shallow. Right TMJ tomogram likewise shows relatively shallow articular eminence and a narrow joint space. Axial views show that the sinuses appear clear. Nasal septum appears reasonably straight, but the left turbinate is quite large. In the coronal view, the sinuses appear clear. The left turbinate is extremely large and appears to block most of the airway. There is deviation of the septum off towards the left side. Left TMJ coronal tomograms show that there is decreased vertical joint space. There is some extension of the condyle out lateral from the lateral pole area. The condylar head appears somewhat enlarged. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.
Right TMJ condyle appears somewhat enlarged as well. Joint space is narrow. Lateral joint space is significantly decreased. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B177 has a skeletal Class III jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks good. The vertical height of the mandibular appears somewhat elongated.

Basic diagnoses for B177 would be as follows:
Bilateral mandibular condylar hyperplasia. Bilateral TMJ posterior displacement of the articular discs. Mandibular prognathism.
Maxillary transverse hyperplasia. Class III end-on occlusion. Anterior and bilateral posterior cross bites. Impacted third molars x4.
Anterior mandibular vertical hyperplasia. Hypertrophied left turbinate causing nasal airway obstruction.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Discontinue all inter-arch elastics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Continue to monitor growth and development Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ high condylectomies and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to set the mandible posteriorly.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to expand and move the posterior aspect slightly vertical. Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to reduce the vertical height of the mandible. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
Left partial inferior turbinectomy.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B177 MRI AGE: 16/M
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is enlarged and appears to have a lateral extension of the lateral pole that extends out equal to the lateral rim of the fossa. Vertical joint space appears quite narrow, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. The discal tissue is difficult to identify.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears quite large. There is a little bit of a lateral extension of the condyle, but not as significant as the opposite side. Joint space appears narrow similar to the opposite side. There may be discal tissue present, but it is very thin and may have some medial displacement. Lateral joint space appears quite thin.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a little bit of anterior beaking present. It appears that there is discal tissue posteriorly displaced. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening, the disc appears to reduce, although translation is somewhat restricted.

Right TMJ sagittal view likewise shows a disc that appears to be posteriorly displaced. On opening, it appears to reduce, although translation is somewhat restricted.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ condylar enlargements with posterior displacement of the articular discs with reduction. MRI findings compatible with bilateral condylar hyperplasia Type 1A.
