B247
B247 is 13 years old, referred by Dr. 
B247 has some asthma problems and takes Singulair, Flonase and Clarinex to treat the condition although it is primarily seasonal. She has had tonsils and adenoids removed 10 years ago. Otherwise, B247 is in good health. B247's jaw problems are of unknown occurrence and etiology. She says she thinks for at least a couple of years that she has had problems. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at nighttime but not during the day. She began her orthodontic treatment 2 years ago with Dr. . She has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain or pain around the head and neck area. She rates her jaw function at 4, diet at 3, disability at 1.

In frontal view, B247 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 6 mm. Maxillary midline is about 1-1/2 to 2 mm off to the left side. Mandibular dental midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline as is the chin. In profile view, she has some AP maxillary deficiency. She has a C-shape to the upper lip. Maxilla is AP retruded in the point A area by about 2 to 3 mm. The chin is approximately 20 mg AP deficient. She has some lip incompetency of probably about 8 to 10 mm. Chin-neckline is short and chin-neck angle is well defined. Submental area is quite full. She has a head-postured forward neck position. She has a full Class II cuspid relationship fairly close to it. A little bit more Class II on the right side than the left side. She has an overjet of probably about 5 to 6 mm. She has vertical overbite about 3 to 4 mm. She is wearing Class II elastics. She has a transverse cant to the occlusion with the right side being 1 to 2 mm lower than the left side. There is some upper arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being 1 to 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. To palpation, B247 has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Incisal opening is about 58 mm. Excursion movement is about 10 mm in each direction. Intranasally, right turbinate is a little bit larger than the left turbinate. The septum may be deviated a little bit off towards the right side but not too significant. On opening, she has some definite popping in her jaw joints, however, it is difficult to determine if it is due to a disc displacement or whether it is due to excessive condylar translation with the condyle coming out well beyond the articular eminence.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the sinuses are difficult to evaluate. She has four developing but interrupted third molars. She has calcification a little bit below the apex of the mandibular right second bicuspid just slightly posterior to the mental foramen.

Waters view shows that the left sinus may have some thickening of the sinus membrane but the right maxillary sinus and the rest of the sinuses appear relatively clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Condyle might be a little bit flattened on the superior head but difficult to tell.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has some slight bony changes present. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Joint space may be slightly decreased posteriorly in one view but it is fairly well balanced. On opening, there is hypertranslation of condyles completely out of the fossa.

B247
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that incisors are a little bit over-angulated. Lateral incisors appear to be in better angulation with the lower jaw. Occlusal plain is increased in angulation. Oropharyngeal airway dimension is about 5 to 6 mm at the soft palate level and 8 mm at the base of the tongue. Occlusal plane appears to be increased in angulation. She has a C-shaped curve to the upper lip.

BASIS DIAGNOSES: Rule out bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation. Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. Transverse maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
AP macrogenia.
Anterior mandibular vertical excess.
Class II occlusion.
Over-angulation of maxillary incisors and lower incisors.
Tooth size discrepancy of 's difference of approximately 2 mm. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction.
Impacted third molars times 4.
Nocturnal clenching and bruxism.
Snoring.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Extract maxillary first bicuspids.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch, retract the upper incisors approximately 4 mm.
Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anteriors removing about 2 mm of tooth structures and retract. MRI of left and right TMJs.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors if indicated based on further clinical and MRI evaluations. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect of the maxilla superiorly, downgraft the posterior aspect, and advance slightly.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance to the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Vertical reduction AP augmentation genioplasty. Partial reduction turbinectomies. Surgical removal of four impacted third molars times four. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion and retain.

B247 Evaluation
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes associated with it. Vertical joint space appears adequate. Fairly minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. Discs may be medially and anteriorly displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact. There appears to be decreased joint space and there appears to be medially displaced discal tissue.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better shape than the opposite side. There appears to be medially displaced disc and some anterior displacement. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little flattening on the anterior head and a little sclerosis on the posterior head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle appears postured forward in the fossa as one might expect with either forward posturing or splint therapy. The disc is anteriorly displaced. Out laterally, the disc is not seen indicative of medial displacement. There is not any significant fluid within the joint space. On opening, there is fairly good translation. On opening it appears that the disc does reduce and the disc translates fairly well.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows out laterally that the disc is not readily seen. There is some arthritis with flattening of the anterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking but not too significant. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc appears to be vertically oriented within the fossa and anteriorly displaced. There does not appear to be any significant inflammation present. Out laterally, the disc is not seen well indicative of medial displacement. On opening the disc appears to reduce and there is good translation of the condyle and disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteromedially displaced with reduction.
