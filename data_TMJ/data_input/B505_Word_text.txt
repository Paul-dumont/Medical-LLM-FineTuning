B505
B505 is 44 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. Primary concerns that B505 has include the following:

Constant pain in the head, neck, and jaw area. Her life is severely affected by her pain problems.
She sleeps a lot because she does not have as much pain then. Failures in every aspect of her life including failing relationships with her husbands, kids, personal and work. Snoring.
Daytime tiredness.

B505 believes her problems began at about the age of 12 years old when her jaw would like in or out. She has had headaches at least since the age of 15 to 16 years old. B505 did not really begin developing significant problems until 4 years ago when she moved into a new house out in the country and then she became aware of earaches. This started the odyssey of seeing the ears, nose and throat specialists. She was diagnosed initially with trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. She was put on some medications and this helped some, but then she became more aware that her pain would increase when she would eat or chew, talk, sing, etc., and thus made the correlation to the joints. She has had surgery performed 11 months ago that involved left disc repositioning by Dr. XXXX. He did get rid of some the nerve pain that she had that was so strong, but she still continues to have severe headache pain and neck, jaw, and shoulder pain. She currently takes the following medications:

Pain cocktail (she does not know what is in the mixture as her pain doctor will not inform her, but it does include opioids).
Lyrica 150 mg 3 times a day.
Effexor 150 mg one per day.

Treatment that she has had until this time include retainers for treatment from the age of 11 to 15, surgery on the left jaw joint 11 months ago. She has had 3 splints during the past 18 months. Her current splint has worked the best for her so far. She has had physical therapy x20 treatments and chiropractic therapy x10 treatments. This has relieved her pain problems. B505 rates her TMJ pain on medications at a level of 3, but even with the medications it usually escalates to at least a 6 during the day. Average daily pain is at 3, jaw function at 2, diet at 5, and disability at 7. On the medication, she gets predominantly left-sided headaches that occur in the frontal, temporal, posterior head and top of the head, although this can escalate up to 6. She has a little bit of numbness in her left cheeks. She gets frequent earaches on the left side and occasional tinnitus and occasional vertigo. The only other joints that really bother her are her neck. She is aware of clenching at night time and also during the day. B505 does have some snoring of moderate severity. She has some moderate daytime somnolence and likes to take naps during the day. She is not aware of sleep apnea problems. She does not have a sleep disorder. She breathes through her mouth at night time.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B505 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. There may be some slight increased fullness on the right side by maybe about 3 mm or so. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is at least 4 mm. The mandibular dental midline and chin are pretty much on the facial midline. The maxillary midline may be just slightly to the right side about 1 mm. The nasal tip is just slightly to the right side also. In profile view, the maxilla and upper lip are retruded by 4-5 mm and the mandible is retruded by 15-18 mm. Chin neckline and angle are not defined. She has about 4-5 mm of lip incompetence. Intraorally, B505 has all of her teeth back through the second molars with a slight increased curve of Spee in the lower arch and some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She appears to have adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some significant crowding of the upper anterior arch and small upper lateral incisors with a probable tooth size discrepancy. She has a reverse curve of Spee in the upper arch. She has a Class II end-on occlusal relationship and an anterior deep bite of about 3-4 mm. The left maxillary cuspid may be about 1 mm higher than the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues all look relatively healthy and normal. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Septum has some deviations to it. Columella is a little bit wide and nostrils are moderately narrow. To palpation, she has high moderate pain over the left TMJ and moderate pain over the left retromandibular, SCM area as well as the left masseter and left medial pterygoid. She has milder tenderness over the right masseter, right medial pterygoid, right retromandibular area, and bilateral shoulders. Maximal incisal opening is 33 mm, but only about 10 mm without pain. Excursion movement to the right is 0, to the left 2 mm. On opening and closing, she has crepitus in the left TMJ, although the right side seems relatively smooth.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has large restorations or crowns on all the posterior teeth. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates are moderate in size and septum has just some slight deviation to it. Joints look arthritic. Coronal view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size and septum has just a slight deviation towards the left side in the bony area of the septum. Axial view shows that the septum is just slightly off towards the left side and turbinates are moderate in size. Sinuses are clear.
Left TMJ sagittal views show a condyle that has some arthritic changes and with some flattening on the head of the condyle, particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Joint space is more narrow towards the lateral aspect of the joint as compared to the medial aspect. Right TMJ sagittal view show some arthritic changes in this joint as well as some anterior beaking and sclerosis on the head of the condyle as well as flattening over the superior aspect particularly towards the medial aspect of the joint. Left TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle that is arthritic with some erosion in the head of the condyle. There is decreased lateral joint space. Vertical joint space may be slightly decreased as well. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3-4 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little better morphology to it, however, there is a significantly decreased lateral joint space, although the vertical joint space looks a little bit wider than the opposite side. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3-4 mm. The disc is probably anteriorly and medially displaced in this joint. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B505 has a retruded maxilla and mandible. The oropharyngeal airway only measures about 2 mm at the soft palate level and probably about somewhere between 4 and 6 mm at the base of the tongue. There is a slight increased occlusal plane angle, but a retruded maxilla and mandible.

Dental model analysis shows that there is a Bolton's difference of 5 mm between the maxillary and mandibular teeth primarily due to the small upper lateral incisors. There is some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch of about probably close to 7 mm. In the same models with Class I cuspid relationship shows that there is bilateral posterior crossbites and an anterior crossbite. B505 does have a transverse deficiency in the maxillary arch. In the lower arch, the bicuspids are tipped lingually a little bit.

Basic diagnoses for B505 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis. Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Maxillary AP, posterior vertical, and transverse hypoplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion with an anterior deep bite of 4-5 mm.
High occlusal plane angle of 19 degrees (normal 8 degrees).
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP airway dimension of 2-3 mm (normal 11 mm).
Severe TMJ pain. Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 5 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Open up 1 mm of space between the upper laterals and cuspids to adjust for the tooth size discrepancy. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2-3 mm of tooth structure to adjust for the tooth size discrepancy and to keep from flaring the lower incisors too far forward. CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction with TMJ total joint prostheses.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction and expand it. Bilateral coronoidotomies.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Restorative dentistry to build up the maxillary lateral incisors.

Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is arthritic and appears to have lost volume. There is an erosion in the top of the condyle. There is decreased joint space particularly in the medial aspect of the joint. Lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3-4 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that also appears to have lost vertical volume. There is a little bit more sclerosis across the top of the condyle. Joint space vertically appears decreased particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. There appears to be some discal tissue medial and anterior to the condyle.

Sagittal MRIs are not labeled, so we label the first one side 1 and shows a condyle that is arthritic. There is sclerosis on the head of the condyle and anterior beaking present. The posterior head is flattened. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. It appears degenerated and deformed. There is decreased superior joint space between the anterior-superior aspect of the condylar head and the base of the articular eminence. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle and the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Side 2 shows some arthritis and some anterior beaking present. There may be discal tissue that may be in position, but it appears to be surrounded by a pannus of tissue. On opening, there appears to be degeneration of the disc with a massive discal tissue posterior to the condyle, but no identifiable disc really anterior to the condyle. The condyle comes just about a third of the way down the articular eminence.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with significant degenerative changes.
Recommend total joint prostheses for this patient.
