B313 
B313 is 45 years old and referred by Dr. __. To B313's best knowledge, her jaw joint problems began when she was about 42 years old of unknown etiology. She did have a vacuum cleaner off a shelf and struck her on the nose, but that is the only trauma she is aware of that has occurred. She only had popping in her joints when she opened real wide prior to the onset of her pain. The treatment she has had to date is comprised primarily of splint therapy during the past year when she found out that the joints are actually involved. She has had two splints to date and neither of them have been able to resolve her problems. She also has had deep massage therapy for 6 months last year. Dr. __ apparently did a nerve burn in her neck and several injections into her neck and shoulders from last year.

B313 currently takes the following medications:
Levothyroxin 25 mcg q.d.
Lunesta 3 mg at bedtime. Amitriptyline 20 mg at bedtime. Flexeril 10 mg at bedtime.

Apparently, at one point, B313 was up to 5 to 6 tablets of amitriptyline at night. When she started to come off of that is when she developed restless leg syndrome.

B313 rates her headaches at a level of 8 in the temple and posterior part of the head as well as on to of the head. She rates her TMJ pain at 5 with the left side greater than right side. She rates her average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 5, diet at 2, disability at 4. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo but does have some hearing loss. She is not aware of any other joint issues. She does have depression. She does smoke 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has done this for 20 years. She has mild snoring and mild daytime somnolence, but does not believe that she has any sleep apnea issues. She does have restless leg syndrome.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B313 has good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is probably about zero. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is shifted off to the left side probably about at least 3 mm. The chin is pretty much on the facial midline. In profile, B313 has fairly good facial balance. Intraorally, B313 has all of her lower teeth back to the second molars. She has crowns on all four lower molars. It appears she has some significant crowding of the lower anterior arch. In upper arch, she is missing a first bicuspid on the right side. There is some slight upper arch asymmetry with the right cuspid being about 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. In the lower arch, the lower left cuspid is about 1-2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. She is a Class III cuspid relationship in the right side by probably 2-3 mm and on the left side she is closer to Class I. Transversely, B313 is fairly level. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. Uvula is mild to moderately elongated. Intranasally, there is some deviation of the nasal septum. Turbinates are relatively normal in size with the right one being a little bit larger than the left one, at least anteriorly. Anteriorly, she has got about 2.5 mm vertical overbite. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the TMJs, high to moderate over the masseter muscles, and minimal pain over the temporalis muscles. Maximal incisal opening is 35 mm, but opening without significant discomfort 26 mm. Excursion movement to the right 3 mm, to the left 8 mm. As B313 opens, she does shift slightly towards the left side maybe 2-3 mm. Joints seem to function reasonably smoothly. B313 says that she used to have clicking almost every time she opened on the left side, but that seems to have gone away.

Basic diagnoses for B313 would be as follows:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and some disc deformation.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with immediate reduction.
Relative mandibular hyperplasia.
TMJ pain, left side greater than the right.
Myofascial pain. Severe headaches. Crowding in the lower anterior arch. Mandible dental midline shifted about 3 mm to the left of the maxillary and facial midlines.
Missing maxillary right first bicuspid.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Surgery: Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to occlusion can be maintained. Application of maxillary and mandibular arch bars.

B313  MRI 
AGE: DOB:
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Side 1 shows some arthritic changes with flattening on the anterior head, a little bit of peaking on top of the condyle. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and somewhat degenerated. On opening, the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. There is good translation of the condyle. There is fluid in the superior joint space.

Side 2 shows some mild arthritic changes in the condylar head. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced, but appears to reduce relatively early on in opening. There is good translation of the condyle and the articular disc with the disc in a reduced position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.
