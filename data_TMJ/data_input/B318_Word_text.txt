B318's problems began about 4-1/2 years ago when she became aware of clicking and popping in her joints. There is no known etiology for the situation. She had stage I orthodontics for about 18 months from about 3 to 4 years ago. This included a Herbst appliance and palatal expansion. She began stage II which she currently is in, earlier this year.

She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. The other joints that bother her include her right wrist but is actually a tendonitis problem. She also has problems with her right ankle where she has had previous surgery for a congenital deformity. She has no known allergies. No particular problems wearing jewelry. She had a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy at age 6-1/2 years. This was done because she had some sleep apnea problems at that time. B318 and her family do not believe she clenches and grinds her teeth at night. She thinks that she breathes predominately through her nose when sleeping. She gets headaches about 2 to 3 times per week generally in the frontal and temple area and they get to about a level of 5. Sometimes they do not last too long but other times they last for awhile and she requires some medication for it. B318 rates her TMJ pain at about a level of 5, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 3, diet at 4, disability at 1.

In frontal view, B318 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about almost 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3.5 mm to 4 mm. Maxillary midline is shifted to the right about 1 mm. Mandibular dental midline and chin are actually a little bit better on the facial midline. There is some slight orbital dystopia of about 1 to 2 mm with the left side being slightly higher than the right side. In profile view, B318 has some AP maxillary deficiency probably about 3 to 4 mm. The chin appears to be AP deficient by about 18 to 20 mm. Chin-neckline is short and chin-neck angle is actually fairly well defined. Intraorally, B318 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Teeth are fairly well aligned and leveled. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Teeth likewise are well aligned and leveled. She has a Class II cuspid molar relationship and almost a full Class II on the left side and less Class II on the right side. She is probably 5 to 6 mm Class II on the left and probably 4 to 5 mm on the right. She has an overjet of probably about 4 to 5 mm. She has about a 0 overbite relationship. As B318 postures forward, it appears that she has a fairly good alignment of the jaw structures. B318 

She has a slight tendency of a crossbite in the second molar areas. She has some small upper lateral incisors and probably has a mild tooth size discrepancy of probably about 2 to 3 mm. Intraorally, the uvula looks normal. Soft palate is mildly elongated but not too significant. Faucial pillars may be slightly constricted but not too significant. Scarring from previous tonsillectomy can be seen in the faucial pillars particularly on the right side. Intranasally, the septum appears relatively straight. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged. She does not feel she has any nasal airway obstruction. The columella is fairly wide at the base. The nostrils may be slightly constricted but not too significant. Luminal valves might be just slightly constricted but not enough to cause any problems for her. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the TMJs and styloid areas. No other tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is about 45 mm. Excursive movement is about 8 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of all the teeth. She has impacted third molars and she has some developing fourth molars that appear as well in the maxilla. Sinuses look relatively clear but difficult to tell on this particular x-ray. The condyles appear somewhat arthritic and so they have lost some volume. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The septum appears relatively straight. X-ray is a little bit dark making it difficult to interpret some of the bony structures.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. A little bit of cloudiness just on the right side of the x-ray though not particularly involving the sinus. The septum looks relatively straight. The turbinates look moderately enlarged. Asymmetry between the maxilla and mandible can be appreciated.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is posteriorly and superiorly positioned in the fossa with significantly decreased posterior and superior joint spaces. Articular eminence is fairly long and moderately steep. The condyle appears quite narrow anteroposteriorly and appears to have lost some significant volume.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that likewise has lost volume and appears shorter in vertical dimension. Significantly decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep and somewhat elongated. The condyle appears very narrow anteroposteriorly. On opening, there is some restricted translation in both joints where the condyles come down toward but not completely beneath the articular eminences.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B318 has slight anterior vertical maxillary excess and posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. The mandible is AP deficient. She has a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship. It appears to occlude only on her second molars, maybe the first but all other teeth are out of occlusion. Correlating this to clinical examination it shows that she occludes only on the right first and second molars and the left second molars. All other teeth are out of occlusion.

B318 
She has a decreased oropharyngeal airway with the airway dimension at the base of the soft palate being about 4 mm to 4.5 mm but less than 5. At the base of the tongue the airway dimension measures about 6 mm.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and disc dislocations without reductions.
Anterior vertical maxillary excess and slight posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Apertognathia. Class II occlusion.
Occluding only on the left second molars and right first and second molars.
Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars. Impacted bilateral maxillary fourth molars.
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Tooth size discrepancy with a 's difference of approximately 2 mm.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch.
Continue to align and level mandibular arch.
Slenderize lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and close the spacing.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxilla superiorly, advance it and down graft the posterior aspect.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Surgical removal of impacted teeth x6.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation: 

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost considerable volume. Decreased superior joint space. There is discal tissue seen medial and anterior to the condyle. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of less than 2 mm. The condyle is narrow mediolaterally. The joint space is actually not too diminished.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost consider volume and perhaps even a little bit more so than the left side. She condyle is very narrow mediolaterally. There is discal tissue medial and anterior to the condyle but predominately medially displaced. Decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly relatively a minimal amount of probably just a couple of mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has reasonable anteroposterior dimension towards the lateral aspect of the joint but medial it is extremely narrow and tiny. There is a significant loss of condylar volume. The articular eminence is actually quite long and steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting down almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly. A little bit of thickening in the posterior band. The condyle has decreased joint space superior and posterior to it. The cortical bone and the fossa appear to be intact. The condylar head itself towards the medial aspect where it is quite tiny lights up significantly. There could be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not much. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle coming down most directly beneath the articular eminence but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. The changes in this condyle and age are compatible with idiopathic condylar resorption.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears smaller than the opposite side. Medially the condyle the condyle is very narrow anteroposteriorly and has a significant hockey stick shape associated with it. Out laterally, the condyle is a little bit wider but there appears to be more loss of bone structure as compared to opposite joint. The condylar head internally lights up significantly particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. The articular eminence is moderately steep and long in length. The articular disc is sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc is foreshortened anteroposteriorly. There could be a small osteophyte sticking off the top of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint. There does not appear to be any significant inflammatory process in the adjacent tissues. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocation nonreducing and with moderate degenerative changes. Right TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocation nonreducing and with moderate degenerative changes.
Discs are probably still salvageable.
