B095
I originally saw her 3 years ago, when she was 11 years old. She has had an adenoidectomy since that time but no other treatment. I originally did a detailed treatment plan on her at her initial evaluation. Being 11 years of age, however, I recommended that we follow her and contemplate surgery at approximately the age of 15. B095 has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain, myofascial, nor any pain around the head and neck area. Incisal opening is 43 mm. Excursion movements are 6 mm in each direction. In frontal view, upper lip length is 23 mm and tooth-lip relationship is 5 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline and mandibular dental midline is 1 mm to the right and chin is about 2 mm to the right. She appears to have a slight transverse cant in her occlusion with the right side being 1-2 mm shorter in vertical height as compared to the left side. She does have significant lip incompetence of probably about 6 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of 2-3 mm and an overjet of about 3 mm. She is Class II end-on by about 1-2 mm on the left side and probably 3-4 mm on the right side. The mandibular dental midline is shifted to the right about 1-2 mm. In profile, upper lip is deficient about 2-3 mm and chin is deficient by probably at least 8-10 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues looks relatively normal. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged on the left side and on the right side as clinically as best as seen in the anterior part of the nose, the turbinate appears relatively normal. She has a wide columella and narrow nostrils. She gives no history of snoring, daytime somnolence, sleep apnea, nor sleep disorder. She is a mouth breather at nighttime and she does have a head postured forward neck position. She did have her adenoids removed probably 2-3 years ago. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. She is on no medications. She has no earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing at nighttime.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of impacted maxillary third molars and mandibular right third molar with an absence of the left third molar. The second molars are not erupted in all the way and there is still fairly soft tissue impacted particularly in the lower arch. There may be some bone across the second molars as well. The mandibular right second molar appears to be impeded more than the other three. The condyles appear small in size. Bilateral facial coronal view shows that she has hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal septum is deviated off and almost touching the right side of the lateral nasal bones. Sinuses appear clear. Axial view shows the turbinates are moderately enlarged and appear to block off a good part of the airway. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows that the condyle appears a little misshapened. The superior joint space appears somewhat decreased. Lateral pole of the condyle is lower than the medial pole by probably 3 mm. Right TMJ coronal tomogram shows a condyle that appears similar to the opposite side with the lateral pole being lower than the medial pole. Joint space appears just slightly thicker than the opposite side. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to be very narrow anteroposteriorly and has a little anterior beaking present. Joint space appears fairly well balanced, but increased anteriorly. Articular eminence is fairly steep. The condyle has a hockey stick shape to it. Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that also appears narrow anteroposteriorly. There is a little bit more of a hook in the shape of the condyle as compared to the opposite side. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. Joint space appears fairly well balanced. Lateral cephalogram shows that she has anterior vertical maxillary excess and posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. There is mandibular AP hypoplasia. There is a high occlusal plane angle and a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship. The oropharyngeal airway is significantly decreased with the airway at the soft palate level being only about 3 mm and the base of the tongue approximately 5 mm.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Possible bilateral TMJ disc dislocation and condylar resorption compatible with AICR.
Maxillary anterior vertical hyperplasia.
Maxillary AP, posterior vertical, and transverse hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being approximately 2 mm shorter in vertical height than the left side. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal septal deviation with spurring.
Impacted maxillary third molars x2 and mandibular right third molar.
Unerupted second molars with bony impaction in the second molars.
Predominantly a mouth breather.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
MRI of the left and right TMJs.
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Consider surgical uncovering of the second molars in the mandible and perhaps even in the maxilla.
Orthodontics to erupt the second molars and put them into proper position.
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ surgery to include possible articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors (dependent on MRI evaluation).
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superiorly, posterior aspect inferiorly, and expand.
Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to augment the chin.
Removal of impacted third molars x3.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.
6. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B095 MRI
Left TMJ shows a condyle that appears arthritic. Joint space may be decreased some vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly only about 2 mm. The disc may be anteriorly and medially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost some vertical volume. Joint space is a little bit wider here than the opposite side. The disc appears to be medially displaced and perhaps anteriorly displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat and curves downward only 1-2 mm. There appears to be some thickening of the bilaminar tissues in the joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposterior. It appears somewhat arthritic. There is some anterior beaking present and a little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. It has a hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly. There is an increased anterior joint space. The disc appears degenerated with slight loss of the intermediate zone. There is some fluid in the superior and anterior joint spaces. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, but the articular eminence remains anteriorly displaced with perhaps partial reduction on wide opening. The disc itself does not translate very well indicative of probably adhesions to the articular eminence.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic with some flattening on the posterior head and some anterior beaking with some sclerosis on the anterior head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is a little bit degenerated and deformed in this side as compared to the opposite side. Vertical joint space appears to be increased. There is some fluid in the inferior and superior joint spaces. Right TMJ opening shows that there appears to be some slight restriction of translation on this side compared to the opposite side. The articular eminence remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations without reduction on the right side and with late reduction on the left side.
