Date of Interpretation:

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has severe osteoarthritic changes present. The condyle is quite sclerotic. Decreased superior joint space. Osteophytes extending up off the superior aspect of the condyle. Significantly decreased joint space. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. There may be some discal tissue severely deformed and towards the medial side of the joint. Also, there could have been some previous surgery in this joint. Some degenerative changes in the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with severe arthritic changes. There is extremely narrow superior joint space and areas that appear to be bone-on-bone contact. There appears to be degenerative changes in the fossa as well. Mild downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of probably a couple of mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a joint with severe arthritic changes. There could be bone-on-bone contact particularly when there are some uneven areas indicative of previous surgery in this joint severely deformed and degenerated. There is a significant amount of fluid associated with this joint towards the lateral aspect and also around the posterior head of the condyle. It lights up significantly. There is not as much of this bright area towards the medial aspect of the joint but predominately lateral and posterior. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. Osteophyte formations are highlighted in the open view. Significantly decreased joint space between the articular eminence and the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that undergone significant osteoarthritic changes and there are also changes that appear to have occurred in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is very minimal joint space vertically and probable bone-on-bone contact in a number of areas. There is significant anterior beaking on this condyle. We do not see the build up of fluids or inflammatory tissues around the joint area. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle coming down towards the articular eminence. Articular disc remains anteriorly displaced and severely deformed. There appears to be bone-on-bone contact.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and perforations.
B290 

B290 is 69 years old, referred by Dr. _. B290 has a history of high blood pressure that was identified about a year ago when her pressure was up to about 220/110. Earlier this year she had a left kidney removed that seems to have helped her. She had a growth on it that may have been pressing against the aorta. She had a hysterectomy done years ago and last year she had a melanoma removed from her right leg.

MEDICATIONS:
Citalopraqn 40 mg daily.
Toprol XL 100 mg daily.
Zetia 10 mg (for cholesterol.)
Ambien 10 mg p.r.n. sleep.
Estradiol 0.5 mg three times per week.
Fosamax 70 mg one time per week. She has been on the Fosamax for about 4 to 5 years.

B290 gets earaches on the left side but no tinnitus or vertigo. She thinks she may be having some hearing loss particularly on the right side. She does have a nodule in her left lung that is being watched. She is aware of clenching of her teeth at night as she wakes up sore in the mornings and tight in the mornings. She may clench some during the day as well. Other joints that bother B290 include her thumbs, her left hip where she has a bursa, and her left knee. She gets headaches about a level of 5 in the temple and posterior head area on a daily basis but they can easily escalate to 8. Her average TMJ pain is 5 but it can escalate to 10. Average daily pain is about 5. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 3, disability at 5.

In frontal view, B290 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary and mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the left. In profile view, B290 has fairly good facial symmetry and balance. There may be some slightly AP deficiency in the chin of maybe 3 to 4 mm but not too significant. Chin-neckline is slightly short but chin-neck angle is well defined. Intraorally, B290 has all of her lower teeth back through the upper arch. She actually has all of her third molars in position. She has a Class I cuspid on the left side and just a light Class II cuspid on the right side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 to 4 mm. Oropharyngeal airway looks healthy. On the left side it appears there may be a little tonsillar nodule in the anterior faucial pillar. Otherwise the uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all look relatively normal. Intranasally the turbinates of are moderate size. On the left side she has a relatively large septal spur that extends out into the left nasal airway. However, even with that there it appears that she does have an adequate nasal airway. She reports that she gets some snoring. She has some tiredness during the day and usually has to take a nap but she is not sure if that is related to her recent kidney operation. She is not aware of having sleep apnea problems. To palpation she has some moderate discomfort over the TMJs, SCMs, left styloid area, left shoulder and very minimal tenderness over the medial pterygoids. In jaw function she has loud audible crepitation in both joints with the left side being a little bit more noisier than the right side. Maximal incisal opening is 41 mm and she can get to about 35 mm without significant pain and discomfort. Excursive movements were about 8 mm in each direction. B290 

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence of the maxillary left second molar. All other teeth are present and accounted for. She has crowns on the first and second molars in the mandible bilaterally and on the maxillary left first molar. Sinuses look clear. A large spur is seen coming out the septum. Left TMJ appears severely arthritic and the right side also appears arthritic but not to the degree as the left side.

Left TMJ tomogram shows that the condyle is postured somewhat forward in the fossa but there are significant degenerative changes present with what appears to be loss of condylar volume. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. There appears to be relatively minimal joint space.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that also has some significant arthritic changes but not quite as severe as the left side. Some anterior beaking and decreased joint space. The condyle likewise is sitting a little bit forward in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. Septum in the bony area at least is relatively straight although clinically there is a spur anteriorly. The turbinates appear moderate in size.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that one side of the mandible is shorter vertically. It is probably the left side and may due to the arthritic changes on that side. Oropharyngeal airway is fairly constricted and measuring only about 4 mm at the soft palate level and about 5.5 mm at the base of the tongue although the tongue appears to be postured posteriorly slightly in this particular radiograph. There appears to be a space definitely between the superior aspect of the tongue and the hard palate and maybe between the tip of the tongue. Therefore the decreased airway space in part may be due to tongue positioning.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis with articular disc dislocations, severe deformation and perforations.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Masticatory dysfunction. Missing maxillary left second molar.
Nocturnal clenching. Small soft lesion measuring about 4 to 5 mm in diameter on the anterior faucial pillars that may be residual tonsillar or adenoid tissue. Patient is taking Fosamax.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications. Discontinue Fosamax and replace with another calcium replacement medication.
Klonopin 1 mg tablets 1 tablet q.h.s. to control clenching.
B290 

CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Application for arch bars.

I gave her a prescription for Klonopin 1 mg tablet dispensing 30 tablets 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x4. I have asked B290 to return to see me in two months to check the lesion on her faucial pillars.
