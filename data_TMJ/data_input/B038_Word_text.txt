B038
B038 is 56 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX.
Primary concerns that B038 has include the following:
Tooth pain.
Headaches.
Teeth breaking down and cracking.
Snoring.
Sleep apnea.
Three different bite positions.

B038 is unsure of when her headache problem began because they only occur occasionally. The etiology is unknown. She does not have any specific TMJ symptoms. She gets occasional headaches at a level of 6 in the frontal, temporal area that feels like they are behind her eyes. She has no TMJ pain. On the average day, she has no facial pain or headaches. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability all at 0. She has had the headaches for probably 30+ years. She has no specific problems with earaches, gets occasional tinnitus and vertigo. No hearing loss. She gets sciatica occasionally bilaterally. She had a hysterectomy about 15 years ago. She is aware of nighttime clenching. She smokes 10 to 20 cigarettes per day and has done this on and off for the past 30 years. When she gets dental treatment or has to manipulate her jaws a lot, she usually ends up with a headache after that experience. Otherwise, when the headaches occur, she does not believe that she wakes up with them in the morning. She takes the following medications:

Cymbalta 60 mg q.d.
Prevacid 50 mg q.d.
Ceterizine 10 mg q.d. (allergy pill).
Vitamins.
Caltrate plus D.
B038 did have previous orthodontics at the age of 15 with the extraction of four first bicuspids. Orthodontics were reinitiated on seven months ago.

In frontal view, B038 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is probably -2 mm. The maxillary midline is about 1 mm off to the left as is the mandibular dental midline, but the chin appears to be fairly well centered. There is a little bow in the nasal dorsum with the mid part of the dorsum shifted off towards the left side by 1 to 2 mm. The left eye is about 2 to 3 mm lower than the right eye. In profile view, B038 has a little bit of nasal ptosis. The maxilla appears to be retruded probably about 3 to 4 mm. The mandible is retruded about 8 to 10 mm. The chin neckline is short and the chin neckline is not well defined. Intraorally, B038 is missing mandibular first bicuspids, but has the rest of her teeth present back through the second molars. She has crowns and inlays on the posterior teeth. The teeth appear to be nicely aligned and leveled. She has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she is also missing first bicuspids, but has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some crowns on the molars as well. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship, being probably about 4 mm Class II. She has an over jet of about 3 mm. She has about a 2.5 mm overbite relationship. When shifts her lower jaw forward, she approaches closer to a Class I relationship, although it is still slight Class II probably related to tooth size discrepancy. The anatomy in her posterior teeth, particularly in the lower arch, is quite flat. B038 states that she carries her stress in her neck and her shoulders and she feels this is related to her headache development that just occurs occasionally. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively healthy.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and four first bicuspids. Sinuses look relatively clear. It is difficult to evaluate the joints, but the articular eminences look fairly steep. The septum looks fairly straight and the turbinates look moderate in size.

Coronal view shows the septum is deviated slightly off to the right side. The turbinates are moderate in size with the left one being slightly larger than the right one, but there appears to be good airway. The sinuses appear relatively clear.

Axial view shows that the septum appears reasonably straight. The sinuses are clear and the left turbinate may be moderate in size and the right one is relatively normal.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is fairly centered in the joint. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is fairly steep. The joint space actually looks reasonably balanced. Medially, the condyle is very narrow anteroposteriorly.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking present. The condyles are very narrow on the medial side. There appears to be balanced joint space. The articular eminence is fairly steep.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. The lateral pole is significantly lower than the medial pole. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 4 to 5 mm. There appears to be reasonable joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The lateral pole is slightly lower than the medial pole, but not as significant as the other side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. The joint space appears reasonably balanced.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B038 has some AP maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 4.5 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue measures 6.5 to 7 mm.

Basic diagnosis for B038 would be as follows:
Maxillary AP and vertical hypoplasia and slight transverse excess.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion. 3 mm over jet.
Snoring.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Sleep apnea symptoms.
Missing all four first bicuspids and all four third molars.
Occasional severe headaches.
History of nocturnal clenching.
Slight tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1+ mm.
Three different bite locations.
Slight anterior dislocation of the articular disc at the lateral aspect of the joint, but medially the disc is in better position and she is asymptomatic.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies which will likely be necessary to get the best occlusal fit. b.	Continue to align and level mandibular arch.
2. Surgery. a.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxillary forward approximately 3 to 4 mm. b.	Bilateral ramus osteotomies to advance forward approximately 9 to 10 mm.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
4. Dental restorations to build up maxillary central incisors.
5. Consider Klonopin following surgery to try to eliminate the habitual clenching pattern.

B038 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. Difficult to identify discal position. Joint space actually looks reasonably good. The lateral pole is lower than the medial pole. The articular disc appears that it may be laterally displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The lateral pole is lower than medial pole. The joint space looks reasonably good.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology, but with some anterior beaking present. Out laterally, the disc appears to be slightly forward, but medially the disc is in a better position. The articular eminence is quite steep in the mid part of the condyle. On opening, there is early reduction of the disc and fairly good translation of the condyle and disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows she has a condyle that some anterior beaking, but fairly good morphology. Out laterally, the disc appears to be anteriorly displaced, but medially it appears to be in better position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is early reduction of the articular disc and good translation of the condyle and disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ moderate arthritis and articular discs anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint but with early reduction.
