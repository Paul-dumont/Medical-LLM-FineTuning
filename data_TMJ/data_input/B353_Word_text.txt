B353 
B353 is 16 years old and is referred by Dr. __.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Teeth do not fit together. Front teeth are apart.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Bite seems to be getting progressively worse.

B353 has had previous orthodontics from the 6th grade through the 8th grade. Apparently he had a fairly good bite relationship at the end of treatment. His bite now has shifted and moved fairly significantly. He has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother him. He is not aware of any problems with clenching or bruxism. The only medication he takes is Allegra D occasionally. He has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain or myofascial pain. Incisal opening is 44 mm and excursive movements are 8 mm in each direction. His joints seem to function relatively smoothly. To palpation he has no tenderness around the head and neck area.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: He has an upper lip length of about 20 mm and upper tooth-to-lip relationship of 3.5 to 4 mm. Transversely the occlusal plane is fairly level. Maxillary dental midline is aligned with the facial midline but the mandibular dental midline is 1/2 mm off to the right and chin is 1 to 2 mm off to the right. There is a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the maxillary right cuspid being about 1 mm lower than the left cuspid. In profile view, the maxilla is retruded by 3 to 4 mm and the chin is retruded by 20 to 25 mm. He has a Class II end-on occlusion and at least a 1 mm anterior open bite. The uvula appears relatively normal although the soft palate appears somewhat elongated and the faucial pillars are mildly constricted. Tonsils are present. Right turbinate is moderately enlarged but the nasal septum is reasonably straight and there does not appear to be any significant nasal airway obstruction. The columella is relatively normal in width and the luminal valves are relatively normal. He gives no history of snoring, daytime somnolence, nor sleep apnea.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of all 4 third molars and they are all impacted. All of the rest of the teeth are present. Sinuses appear somewhat cloudy. Difficult to evaluate the nasal airway. The condyles look relatively normal as best as they can be seen in this view.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are relatively clear with a little bit of cloudiness in the left side. The bony septum is relatively straight. Turbinates are moderately enlarged with some decreased nasal airway appearance.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit small and a little bit flat on top. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically but a little bit difficult to read these x-rays. There appears to be some beaking on the anterior head of the condyle. The condyle does appear narrow. Articular eminence is relatively steep and elongated vertically. B353 

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit narrow and there appears to be some decreased joint space vertically. Articular eminence is moderately steep and elongated. On opening, there is moderately good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiographic shows that there is overangulation of the lower incisors. There is anterior vertical maxillary excess and probably posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. The occlusal plane is moderately steep. Oropharyngeal airway may be 4 to 5 mm at the soft palate level and 6 mm at the base of the tongue. Inferior turbinates extend beyond the posterior aspect of the hard palate. A little bit of adenoid tissue remaining in the nasopharynx but not too significant.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations in anteromedial direction. It appears that the discs do reduce on opening. AP maxillary deficiency but vertical excess and posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. AP mandibular deficiency. Class II end-on occlusion. Anterior open bite. Impacted third molars x4.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Overangulation of lower incisors. Significant tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2.5 mm of tooth structure and retract to correct for the tooth size discrepancy as well as to decrease the overangulation of the lower incisors.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxilla superiorly and down graft the posterior aspect. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
HTR implant to anterior mandible. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B353  MRI Evaluation
Age: 16-year-old male.
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is fairly wide in the mediolateral dimension. Decreased superior joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Disc appears medially displaced. Cortical bone appears thin over the top of the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be significantly decreased vertical joint space. Disc appears to be medially displaced. Cortical bone appears thin.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears fairly arthritic now anteroposteriorly. There is significant flattening on the anterior head. There is some superior beaking of the condyle with almost an osteophytic kind of formation. Articular eminence is extremely steep and long vertically. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced. Out laterally, the disc is not seen. There is fluid in the superior joint space anterior to the condylar head. On opening, there is some restricted translation but the disc appears to reduce. On the open view, in one of the cuts of condyle it has a very unusual appearance to it.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is now anteroposteriorly. There is some anterior beaking and some flattening on the anterior head. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is steep but not quite as long as the opposite side. The disc is anteriorly displaced. There may be minimal fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle coming down beneath the articular eminence and the disc appears to be reduced.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated anteromedially.
