B424 
B424 is 22 years old, referred by her mother X. B424 is in good health with no major medical problems. She takes birth control pills but no other medications. B424's joint problems began she believes sometime around the age of 10 years old. Etiology is unknown. She had orthodontics from the age of 13 to 15 by Dr. XX. Following the completion of orthodontics she said she felt that something was not right with her jaws and her jaw joints and her bite ended up being retruded with excessive overjet relationship. B424 feels that her bite is continuing to shift and move. When she bites, her teeth do not bite in the same place everytime but there are different areas that touch or meet. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus or hearing loss, but does have problems with vertigo. No other joints bother her. When she wakes up in the morning she has a weird sensation that involves some nausea sort of feelings, lightheadedness and dizziness. She is aware of clenching and bruxing of her teeth at night and she also does it sometimes during the day. She gets headaches about every couple of months that she rates at about a level of 5 and they occur predominately in the frontal and temple areas as well. She reports no TMJ pain and on an average day she does not have any significant pain around the head and neck area. She rates her jaw function at 3, diet 0, disability at 0. She has had no specific treatment for her TMJ and jaw problems.

PRIMARY CONCERNS
Teeth do not fit together very well.
Teeth and bite continue to shift.
Lightheadedness and dizziness. Weird feeling in the morning of nausea and dizziness. Front teeth do not touch.
Difficulties biting foods because the front teeth do not touch.
Frequent mouth breathing.

In frontal view, B424 has very good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4.5 to 5 mm. The nasal tip is deviated off to the right side probably about 3 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the lower teeth and chin. In profile view, B424  has fairly good balance of the upper lip, cheeks and nose. Upper lip could be retruded no more than a couple of millimeters at the most. The chin is retruded approximately 15 mm. Chin neck-line is not well-defined and chin-neck angle is not well-defined either. She has some fullness in the submental area. Intraorally, B424 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. The teeth are fairly well aligned and leveled. She has adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth except it is a little bit thin between the central incisors. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. B424 has a Class II end-on occlusion with about a 4 mm overjet relationship anteriorly. She has about 4 to 5 mm Class II. She has a 1 mm anterior open bite. She has a little bit of tendency towards the crossbite in the bicuspid area. The other teeth are okay. Anteriorly, the oropharynx appears relatively normal tissue-wise and the uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all appear relatively normal. She has moderately enlarged tonsils. Turbinates are moderately enlarged particularly the right side and it appears larger even on the left side. The septum has some tipping off to the left and right side but relatively straight. She has some moderate nasal airway obstruction.  

The columella and nostrils are relatively normal and the luminal valves are normal. Occlusion is in centric relation predominately on the second molars on the right side, and on the left side the second bicuspids, first and second molars might also touch. To palpation she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Palpating the jaw joints during function reveals that she has inconsistent opening clicking and popping in the left joint that is much more obvious in excursive movements. In the right side, she would have an occasional click or pop on wide opening, but more common on excursive movements. It is indicative that she has bilateral displaced articular disc but are inconsistent at reduction on opening. Occasionally, the pops are audible. Maximal incisal opening is 54 mm. Excursive movement to the right 11 mm, to the left 12 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a root canal on the maxillary left first molar. Sinuses look relatively clear as best as they can be evaluated. Condyles are off the radiograph.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is small and has lost vertical dimension and overall condylar volume. The articular eminence is relatively shallow. Joint may be decreased superiorly but difficult to tell.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has lost vertical dimension and overall volume. Decreased superior and posterior joint space is present. Articular eminence is moderately steep, perhaps just a little bit steeper than the opposite side.

On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.
Waters view shows that the septum has some significant deviation to it as there are two images of the septum indicative of a significant deflection off to the right side. Turbinate on the right side appears enlarged and not much airway appears to be present on the right side. On the left side, there is some airway but normal. Sinuses all appear clear.

Cephalometrically, B424 has a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship. It appears to occlude only on the second molars. She has an overjet of about 4 to 5 mm and slight anterior open bite of about 1 mm. Oropharyngeal airway is significantly reduced with dimension of the soft palate level about 4 to 5 mm and the base of the tongue about 5 mm. There is a Bolton's tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 1.5 mm.

BASIC DIAGNOSES Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocation and significant deformation.
Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
 

Transverse maxillary deficiency. AP microgenia.
Class II occlusion. Anterior open bite.
Occludes predominately on the right second molars and left second bicuspid first and second molars.
Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Decreased nasal airway.
Tooth side discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1.5 mm.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from moving the lateral incisor any further forward and to correct tooth size discrepancy Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning with Mitek anchors and artificial ligaments
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counter-clockwise direction with bone screw stabilization
Multiple maxillary osteotomies with bone plate stabilization and hydroxyapatite grafting
Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to augment the chin
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies 3. Post surgical orthodontics Finish and retain

B424 MRI Evaluation 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant resorption. It has lost transverse width. It has some lateral beaking of the condyle. A little bit of sclerosis on the top of the condyle and some unevenness in the shape. It appears there is discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of about 2 to 3 mm. Joint space might be slightly narrow.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that similarly has lost transverse width and vertical height in the condyle. Some lateral beaking of the condyle is present. There is decreased joint space that appears vertically. There may be discal tissue anterior but difficult to tell on this side. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa about 2 to 3 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone obvious changes with perhaps loss of vertical height and transverse width as the condyle is only seen in three views. There is moderately steep articular eminence. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. It is significantly shortened anteroposteriorly. The condylar head itself has areas where there appears to be some sclerosis present and areas where there may be some erosion that may have occurred with subsequent sclerosis. Joint space actually does not look too bad vertically. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. There is very good translation of the condyle and disc but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with loss of vertical height. The condyle shows only about 3 of the views again indicative of perhaps significant narrowing of the condylar width. There is anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. This seems to have a little bit better morphology than the opposite side. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ severe arthritis (ICR) with articular disc dislocation with significant deformation and nonreducing.
Right TMJ severe arthritis (ICR) with articular disc dislocation with significant deformation and nonreducing.
Discs may still be salvageable.
