is 54 years old and referred by Dr.  . About 14 years ago she began getting headaches and temporomandibular joint pain. She had her first MRI last year and had bilateral arthroscopic temporomandibular joint surgery performed by Dr. __. Bilateral lavages were done by Dr. _ 3 years ago. She was then treated for Ernest syndrome by Dr. __of . A second MRI was performed. Dr. _ in , did the second bilateral arthroscopies. She has felt worse since that time. Before the second arthroscopy her pain was worse on the left side than right side but since the arthroscopy the pain is much worse on the right side. She has developed crepitation which she did not have prior to that second arthroscopy. She had a third MRI on last year, and then she had a third arthroscopy done on the right TMJ in late last year. She went through extensive physical therapy afterwards in and in . She wore a bite plate that the patient feels has not helped her significantly. Earlier this year, Dr. _ordered another MRI. Dr. _ is a dentist at the __ and told her that she had avascular necrosis. Her pain is getting worse particularly in the right jaw joint. It radiates down her right leg to her foot. She is not taking any pain medication except for aspirin, Cymbalta 60 mg (antidepressant) and Ambien for sleep. She occasionally takes Ativan, Excedrin and she takes Lipitor. She gets pain in her right ear but no dizziness. She has significant difficulties functioning at times. She has no stability in the right joint. The right teeth touch but the teeth on the left side do not touch because her mouth pulls off to the right side at times. She is still undergoing physical therapy

has some significant difficulties with earaches on the right side. She has some symptoms of vertigo but she is not aware of any problems with tinnitus or hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her neck possibly and down at L5-S. Last year she had a synovial cyst removed. She gets some pain shooting down through her legs currently that may be related to her back problem. does state that she has fibromyalgia and she has flu-like symptoms. She gets pain down the back of her legs that she does feel is related to her back. She is aware that she may clench sometimes during the day. has had problems with headaches since the 20s. It is possible this could have been when the onset of her TMJ problems began. She has continuous headaches and she rates them about a level of 7 and they occur predominately in the temporal and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at a level of 8 but it can escalate to 10. Average daily pain is about 6. She rates her jaw function and diet at 3, disability at 6. In frontal view, has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. There may be a little vertical asymmetry in the mandible with the right side being may be 2 to 3 mm higher than the left side.

Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship -2. Maxillary midline is about 1 mm off to the right. Mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the left. Chin is pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, she may have just a slight AP maxillary and mandibular deficiency but not too significant. Chin-neckline is not well defined. Intraorally she is missing the lower first bicuspids and has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She had adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch she has had first bicuspids extracted as well. 
She has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. She has an open bite tendency on the left side. She has about 1.5 mm of vertical overbite. Incisal opening is 44 mm. Excursive movements about 7 mm in each direction. To palpation, she has some mild-to-moderate pain over the temporalis, TMJs, styloid areas, posterior neck and shoulder areas. She has significant audible crepitation in the right TMJ. She does snore when she sleeps. She does have a significant sleep disorder problem. She has a lot of problems with daytime tiredness. She has had orthodontics x2 when she was a teenager. The first doctor did not believe in taking teeth out and then went to another and he extracted the 4 first bicuspids. She has some moderate enlargement of the uvula. The soft palate appears somewhat elongated and the distance from the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall looks somewhat constricted. Faucial pillars look moderately constricted. It is difficult to see the soft palate because of its low position. The turbinates are moderately enlarged but not too significant. The septum is deviated a little bit off to the right side. Holding the nostril opens, she has pretty good functional airway. She has some constricture of the luminal valves. Nostrils and columella appear relatively normal in size and dimension. After the second TMJ arthroscopy and after ignition of splint therapy, her back teeth would not touch together. After the third arthroscopy, then the teeth began to touch on the right side but still touch well on the left side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. Normal 4 first bicuspids. She has root canals on the mandibular left second bicuspid first and second molars with crowns with crowns on the molars. On the right side, she is missing the first mandibular first molar. There is a bridge to replace it with crowns on the second bicuspid and second molar. The second bicuspid also has a root canal.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The septum is deviated a little bit off towards the right side.

Right TMJ tomogram shows what appears to be severe arthritis present. There are erosions up in the fossa and the articular eminence is almost absent.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good space around it but actually there is almost excessive space vertically. There is a pseudocyst in the condylar head. It feels up most of the superoposterior aspect of the condyle. On opening, there is actually a good translation in the joints and presents a different image as compared to the MRI open positions where there was virtually no movement. In the open view, the degenerative changes on the right condyle and fossa are quite evident.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has basically a Class I skeletal and occlusal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway dimension is about 6 mm at the base of the soft palate and closer to about 9 mm at the base of the tongue. 

BASIC DIAGNOSES
Right TMJ severe resorptive reactive arthritis. Left TMJ reactive arthritis versus connective tissue autoimmune disease.
AP maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency. Transverse cant in the occlusal pain with the right side of the face being 2 mm shorter vertical than the left side.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Masticatory dysfunction.
Snoring.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Mild crowding of lower anterior arch.
Hypertrophied uvula.
Hyperplastic soft palate. Daytime somnolence.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to be sure there is adequate room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch.
CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward and level it transversely.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Bilateral coronoidectomies.
UPPP procedure.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B376 MRI Evaluation
Age: 53, F
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation: 
There are no coronal views.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has little bit of sclerosis on the front aspect of it. Out laterally, the disc is not seen quite as well which could mean it may be partially medially displaced. The disc appears quite thick. The posterior band appears a little bit degenerated but hard to tell. There appears to be significant fluid in the superior and to a lesser degree in the inferior joint space. There is also some fluid anterior to the disc and running in a 45 degree angle to the horizontal plane. This possible could be a vascular entity. However, it is quite wide and perhaps could be some kind of reactive pannus. The disc appears as though it is just about ready to become displaced. The condyle is on the very posterior aspect of the posterior band of the disc. Superior joint space is excessive in vertical height due to the thickness of the disc. On opening, there is virtually no translation on the condyle at all. Essentially there is virtually no movement in the joint that can be detected.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant degenerative changes. There is a decreased superior joint space between the condyle and the disc. The articular eminence is completely flattened off. There are some degenerative changes in the fossa itself. The disc is anteriorly displaced and severely deformed. There appears to be perhaps reactive pannus around the remaining discal tissue. On opening, there is virtually no visible movement of the condyle or fossa. The top of the condyle has significant erosions associated with it. There is probably at least significant fibrous ankylosis in this joint.

IMPRESSION
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc partially displaced but may be reactive pannus surrounding the disc. There is at least a significant inflammatory process present. Right TMJ severe arthritis with condylar resorption and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and perhaps reactive pannus around the disc. Rule out connective tissue disease.

In comparative analysis to an MRI taken late last year, shows that the right joint has undergone considerably worse degenerative changes during the ensuing 5 months. Also, the left TMJ looked actually worse on the MRI from late last year, though the disc appears to be in position. There may be some reactive tissue around it. She did have some fluid around the left showing but not nearly as much as there currently is. Actually in the right TMJ films from late last year, she had significant fluid or inflammatory tissue in the superior joint space that might be more involved than just fluid. Both joints look worse on the newest MRIs compared to the one taken late last year.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES
Connective tissue autoimmune disease.
Reactive arthritis.
