B477 
B477 is 43 years old and referred by Dr. XX.

Patient History
She has been diagnosed as having bipolar depression, Previous surgeries include C-section, total hysterectomy performed 8 years ago, she had a tonsillectomy at the age of 20, and she had breast implants 14 and 8 years ago. She has one child, age 9 years. She smokes a quarter pack of cigarettes per day and has done that for 27 years.

B477 has no problems with earaches, vertigo, or hearing loss but does get occasional tinnitus. The only other joints that bother her are her finger joints. She says that her sister and mother have significant problems with rheumatoid arthritis. She is allergic to PENICILLIN and has difficulties wearing cheap earrings.

TMJ problems began at least back around 8 years ago of unknown etiology. Initially it was just somewhat bothersome but has been fairly bad for the last three years and severe for the past year. She doesn't have any significant problems with headaches. On an average day, her pain levels are at a level of 8, left side worse than the right side. She rates her jaw function at 8, diet at 5, and disability at 4. B477 began splint therapy 2 years ago, and she currently has had four different splints. None have helped her with her pain and jaw dysfunctional problems. Some of the splints actually made her situation worse.

Difficulties sleeping related to the pain factors
Can't open her jaws
Unable to touch the left side of her face when she gets up in the morning because of the pain
Clenching and bruxing at night

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B477 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted a good 2 to 3 mm off to the right side, and the chin is probably about 3 to 4 mm off to the right side.

In profile view, B477 has fairly good AP facial balance. Chin-neckline is a little bit short, and chin-neck angle is not really well defined. Some slight AP maxillary and mandibular deficiency. Maxilla is probably retruded by maybe 3 mm and chin by maybe 5 to 6 mm.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. A lot of attrition on her lower incisors and the cuspids. Has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she is missing the maxillary right lateral incisor replaced by a four-unit bridge, and she is missing the maxillary left first molar. Is also missing the mandibular right first bicuspid. Has root canals on the maxillary left lateral incisor, right central incisor, and lateral incisor, and second molar, mandibular right first molar, right central incisor, and lateral incisor. She has a lot of crowns on her teeth including from the upper left central incisor through the right cuspid is a four-unit bridge, left lateral incisor, left second molar, mandibular left first and second molars, right central and lateral incisor bridge from cuspid to second bicuspid and right first and second molars. B477 has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right side and basically Class I on the left side. She has an anterior deep-bite of about 4 mm. Transversely, the occlusal plane is fairly level. Mandibular right cuspid is probably 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. Upper arch is fairly symmetric. Oropharynx appears fairly clear. No evidence of any lesions.

Intranasally, turbinates are of relatively normal size. Nasal septum is deviated significantly off toward the left side. There is still adequate airway on the left side albeit smaller than the right side.

To palpation, B477 has some high moderate pain over the left TMJ, left temporalis area, moderate pain over the left posterior neck area, and mild pain over the left masseter muscle. On excursive movements, the joints seem to function relatively smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is 27 mm. She can open to 20 mm without severe pain, but when she hits 27, she has quite severe pain. Excursive movement to the right is 7 mm and to the left 5 mm. When she shifts her mandible to the left, she has significant pain in the left joint area. As she opens, she does deviate off to the left side probably 2 to 3 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows that the sinuses appear clear. Missing maxillary left first molar, right lateral incisor, and mandibular right first bicuspid. All four third molars are absent. She just recently had the maxillary left first molar extracted. She had root canals on the maxillary left second molar, lateral incisor, central incisor, and mandibular right central, lateral incisor, and first molar. She has a bridge replacing the mandibular right first bicuspid and maxillary right lateral incisor. She has some significant arthritis in the left TMJ and to a milder extent in the right TMJ.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes associated with it. Posterior head is flattened as is the anterior head. A little bit of anterior beaking present. Condyle has a hockey stick shape to it. Some what appears to be changes in trabecular pattern inside the condylar head. Articular eminence is fairly steep but not too long in length. Joint space may be slightly decreased vertically.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little sclerosis on the top of it. Articular eminence is high moderate steepness. Appears to be reasonable joint space around the condyle. Condyle looks healthier than the opposite side.

On opening, there is good translation of both joints. In fact, the left joint has a slightly greater translation than the right side. There is a difference, though, with the arthritis in the left joint significantly greater than the right side.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Septum is somewhat deviated off toward the left side.
Cephalometric evaluation shows that she has a good oropharyngeal airway. Slight AP maxillary and mandibular deficiency. Slightly increased occlusal plane angle. Vertical discrepancy in the inferior border of the mandible with the right side being vertically shorter than the left side. Appears to be a cant in the occlusion, but it is more noticeable toward the molars as compared to the anterior teeth.

Basic Diagnoses
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Relative mandibular hyperplasia
Severe left TMJ pain
Left myofascial pain
Masticatory dysfunction
Nocturnal clenching and bruxism
Missing maxillary left first molar
Missing maxillary right lateral incisor but replaced in a four-unit bridge
Missing mandibular right first bicuspid replaced by a three-unit bridge

Removal of arch bars probably one to two months postsurgery
Restorative dentistry
I gave B477 a prescription for Klonopin 1 mg tablets, disp. 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x 4.

B477 MRI Scan Evaluation  
Date of Acquisition:	 
Date of Reading:  
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Appears to be decreased joint space over laterally. Disc may be anteriorly displaced but difficult to tell. Imaging of the joint is not as good as desired. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of probably not more than a couple of millimeters. Discs may be anteriorly displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Roof of the fossa is very thin. Could be some degenerative changes in the fossa itself.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good medial width. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of maybe 2 mm. Joint space looks fairly good but difficult to tell exactly where the disc is. May be in position with some medial displacement. Condyle appears to have good mediolateral width.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has some very unusual morphology. Has a hockey stick shape toward the mid and medial aspect of the joint. Out laterally, it has more of a pyramid-type shape. The articular eminence is fairly steep in the midportion of the joint and more shallow toward the lateral aspect. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced out at the lateral aspect of the joint but over medially is in somewhat better position. Out laterally, the posterior band of the disc is significantly thickened. More medially, it appears is more normal thickness. There is some fluid in the superior joint space particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint. No particular inflammatory process seen. The condyle toward the medial aspect has a very unusual reverse curve in the condylar head and with some sclerosis on the anterior aspect.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc as the disc reduces.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology but has some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Might be a slightly decreased posterior joint space. Posterior band of the disc appears thickened. Out laterally, the disc could possibly be slightly anteriorly positioned.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc. Could be that the disc is in a relatively normal position on this side and would want to evaluate for clinical evaluation.

Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation but with early reduction
Right TMJ arthritis but probable good position of the articular disc

Date of Interpretation: 

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is a little divot in the top of the condyle just lateral of midline. There appears to be decreased superior joint space particularly at the medial aspect of the joint. The lateral rim of the fossa has moderate downward curvature of maybe about 3 mm. Anteriorly the disc can be seen and it appears to be laterally displaced as well as anteriorly. The condyle appears slightly sclerotic compared to the opposite side.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount of about 2 to 3 mm. There appears to be decreased joint space laterally as well as medially. The discal tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone some significant arthritic changes. There is significant flattening on the anterior head and on the posterior head as well. The condyle has a definite hockey stick shape to it. At the lateral aspect of the joint the disc is anteriorly displaced but more medial, the disc is in better position. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There is a little anterior beaking present. There is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle and there may be an area where there is a divot in the anterosuperior functional aspect of the condyle. There is a definite hotspot within the bone of the condyle just on the anterior aspect of where the divot is located. There is fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is fairly good translation and the disc reduces upon opening. A hotspot remains in the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some flattening on the anterior head with a little bit of anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc may be anteriorly displaced at the very lateral aspect of the joint. As we approach the medial side it appears to be in a little bit better position and a somewhat vertical orientation where it might act as a wedge pushing the condyle posteriorly. No particular fluid in the joint. On opening, there is moderate translation and reduction the articular disc.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis with anterior displacement of the articular disc at the lateral aspect of the joint but with reduction. There is an area of inflammation within the condylar head.
Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocated primarily at the lateral aspect of the joint.
