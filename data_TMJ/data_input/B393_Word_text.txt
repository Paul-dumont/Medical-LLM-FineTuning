B393's problems began at least 13 years ago or probably longer of unknown etiology. She wore a splint for 13 years. She had orthodontics done for one year. She had all of her teeth capped in an attempt to try to control her pain problems. She has had physical therapy for at least three to four years and goes on a weekly basis. She had some previous ear problems and had Grommet tubes placed in her ears. She gets earaches on the left side. She sometimes will get tinnitus. She occasionally will get vertigo. She has about a 60% hearing loss. Other joints that bother include her neck, lumbar area of her back, right elbow, and right knee. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing her teeth at night. She gets headaches with the left side greater than the right side relative to frequency and they are at a level of 9 involving the frontal, temporal, posterior head and top of the head areas. These occur daily. She rates her TMJ pain at 9 with the left side greater than the right side and average daily facial pain at 8. She rates her jaw function and diet at 8, disability at 5.

In frontal view, B393 has increased facial dimension on the left side of the face. The left side of the face is probably a good 6 mm more so than the right side. Upper lip length is about 24 mm, upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 to 2 mm. The nasal tip is deviated off to the right side about 2 mm. The maxillary dental midline is off to the left 1 mm. Mandibular dental midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline as there are only three lateral central incisors. The chin appears to be fairly close to being on the midline. She is probably missing the mandibular right central incisor. She has anterior deep bite of about 1 mm. In profile view, she has some ptosis of the nasal tip. Chin-neckline is short. Prominence of the chin, cheeks, upper lip are fairly good. Intraorally, missing likely the left mandibular left central incisor, right first second and third molars, left first bicuspid, and third molar. In the upper arch, she is missing the right second and third molars and left third molar. She is also missing the first bicuspid on the maxillary left side. She has basically a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side and a Class III end-on cuspid relationship on the left side. She has a posterior yaw in the maxilla and mandible of about 2 to 3 mm towards the left. Anterior deep bite in centric relation appears to be more around 2 mm. Slight tendency towards a crossbite in the right first bicuspid area. Oropharyngeal tissues appear fairly healthy. Uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal.

 
Faucial pillars appear moderately constricted transversely. Intranasally, the septum is deviated off to the right side. The turbinates appear moderate in size. She reports that she has snoring. She has at least moderate daytime tiredness. She will wake up at times unable to catch her breath. B393 gets daily headaches at a level of 9 in the frontal, temporal, posterior head and top of the head area with a greater frequency on the left side than the right side. She rates her TMJ pain at 9 being greater on the left side than the right side and average daily pain at 8. She rates her jaw function and diet at 8, disability at 5. Maximal incisal opening 41 mm, excursive movements about 7 mm in each direction. She has significant crepitation in the left joint and to a lesser degree in the right joint. To palpation, she has severe pain to the left TMJ, left temporalis area, left styloid CM, posterior neck and shoulder area. She also has severe pain in the right posterior neck, right styloid and right shoulder area but not quite as severe as the left side. She has moderate pain over the medial pterygoids, right masseter, right temporalis and right TMJ area as well as the right SCM.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows that she has an impacted maxillary right third molar. She is missing the maxillary upper right first molar and has a second molar in the first molar position. On the maxillary left side, she is missing first bicuspid and third molar. In the mandible, she is missing mandibular left first molar and third molar but the first molar is replaced by bridge. On the right side, she is missing all three molars. She has root canals on the mandibular right first and second bicuspids. The sinuses look relatively clear. Both condyles appear to arthritic with the left side having more severe arthritic changes as compared to the right side.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. The septum, at least in the bony area appears relatively straight. Turbinates appear moderate in size and she appears to have an adequate nasal airway.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a joint that appears to be arthritic. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be decreased superior joint space. There is flattening on the posterior head of the condyle, perhaps a little bit of anterior beaking present.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a joint that appears quite arthritic with not much of a discernable joint space present. Articular eminence is moderately steep and appears somewhat deformed. There appears to be a fairly large depression in the head of the condyle. On opening, there is actually fairly good translation of both condyles but both condyles appear quite arthritic.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has basically a skeletal Class I cuspid molar relationship. Oropharyngeal airway actually looks reasonably good with an airway dimension at the soft palate level of about 8 mm and at the base of the tongue about 9 to 10 mm. The tongue does not appear to fill the oral cavity. In fact, it sits well down below the roof of the fossa and the maxillary dental alveolus.
 

BASIC DIAGNOSES Severe TMJ pain.
Severe headaches.
Severe muscle pain around the head and neck area.
Difficulty eating and chewing.
Earaches.
Missing teeth which include missing mandibular right first, second and third molar, right central incisor, left first bicuspid, first molar, and third molar. Also missing maxillary left first bicuspid, third molar and maxillary right first molar with the maxillary right third molar impacted.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
CT scan of jaw and jaw joints.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Application of arch bars.

B393  MRI EVALUATION  
Left TMJ coronal view shows severe deformation of the condyle. There is significant depression in the midline of the condyle. There is almost an overgrowth in the medial condylar pole area. The lateral condylar pole appears deformed. There appears to be reactive heterotopic bone present in the fossa extending into depression in the condyle. There appears to be significant degenerative changes in the fossa as well as on the condylar head. There appears to be some discal tissue over medial or it could be a calcified body medial to the condyle. The roof of the fossa appears quite sclerotic and thick compared to the opposite side.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost mediolateral width. Significantly decreased joint space and perhaps it could be bone-on-bone contact at the medial aspect of the joint. Also laterally, there is significantly decreased joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa appears inferiorly a mild amount of perhaps 2 to 3 mm at the most. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows severe degenerative changes in the condyle. The condyle is severely deformed at the lateral aspect of the joint and there appears that there could be actual ankylosis in the mid and medial aspect of the joint or significant osteophytic developments in these areas. There is anterior beaking present. The fossa appears quite thick and sclerotic. There may be discal tissue anteromedial. The most medial aspect of the joint bone appears quite sclerotic and there may be ankylosis. On opening, there is some translation of the condyle but not real significant. There appears to be a lot of perhaps calcified tissues around the joint area. Translation is quite restricted but there is some minimal translation.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost volume vertically and perhaps even anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is discal tissue anterior to the condyle although somewhat degenerated. There is anterior beaking of the condyle in some views. There appears to be decreased posterior joint space and superior joint space in some of the views. On opening, there is restriction of translation and significantly deformed articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION
Left TMJ severe arthritis with degenerative changes of both the condyle and the fossa.
Right TMJ severe arthritis (not as severe as the left side) and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and nonreducing.
The patient is indicated for bilateral total joint prostheses.
