B019
B019 is 22 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B019's TMJ problems began to the best of her knowledge when she was 18 years old. The TMJ problems seemed to begin after her orthodontic treatment was completed. She had had functional complaints from about the age of 5 and then had full orthodontic treatment from the age of 12 to 15 including head gear. Occlusion came out very nice. When she was 18 was the first she became aware of having clicking and popping in her jaw joints. She gets no headaches, but does get TMJ pain at about a level of 4. On the average day, she does not have any real significant pain. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 0, disability at 0. B019 does feel that her bite has changed and she feels as though her back teeth are touching before any of the other teeth. She feels this is getting progressively worse for her. She currently takes no medications. The only other joint that bothers her is her foot where she has an abnormal bone formation. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo. She is aware of clenching at nighttime and sometimes does wake up with discomfort in her jaws.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: In frontal view, B019 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. There may be just some slight increased fullness in the right angle area. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 4.5 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is about 2 to 3 mm posterior to subnasale and probably about 6 mm AP deficient. Chin may be approximately 15 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is shorter, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. She does have a high mandibular plane angle facial morphology. Intraorally, B019 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Teeth are in excellent condition, nicely aligned and leveled and attached gingiva looks normal. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. There is a slight increase curve of Wilson in the upper arch. She has a slight Class II end-on cuspid relationship being about maybe 1 to 2 mm Class II. She has an anterior deep bite of about 2 mm. Uvula, soft palate, and fascial pillars all look relatively normal as do the tonsils. Intranasally, the turbinates appear moderately enlarged and a little bit boggy looking. The septum appears reasonably normal. There is probably some mild to moderate airway obstruction perhaps particularly when she is sleeping. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Incisal opening is 56 mm. Excursion movements are about 1 mm in each direction. On opening, she has a click in the left joint about 25 mm of opening and closing at 20 mm. On the right side, she has an opening click of 35 mm and a closing click of about 30 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses look reasonably clear. The condyles appear as though there has been some bone resorption that has occurred. Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear and the turbinates are moderately enlarged. Right TMJ tomogram shows that a condyle that appears a little bit smaller in size as well as loss of vertical dimension. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be a pseudocyst in the head of the condyle. There appears to be decreased superior joint space. Left TMJ tomogram shows the condyle appears smaller in size as though there has been some previous resorption that has occurred. There is a pseudocyst that is fairly large in the head of the condyle. There may be some decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. On opening, there is good translation of both joints. Both joints look as though they have lost some bony volume in the open views. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B019 has a retruded maxilla and mandible with a high occlusal plane angle. The oropharyngeal airway is constricted with an airway dimension of about 5 mm at the base of the tongue and about 6 to 7 mm at the soft palate level.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction (possible AICR). AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Anterior vertical maxillary hyperplasia.
Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.
High occlusal plane angle of 21 degrees (normal 8 degrees). Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 5 mm (normal 11 mm).
Hypertrophied turbinates. Partial nasal airway obstruction.
Sleep apnea symptoms including snoring and daytime somnolence.
TMJ pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Consider expanding the lower arch slightly if possible, but do not orthodontically expand the maxillary arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward approximately 6 mm, move the anterior aspect superiorly 2 mm and down graft the posterior aspect 5 mm to decrease the occlusal plane angle and also expand the arch if necessary.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
