B444 
B444 is 22 years old and is referred by Dr. XXXX.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Severe headaches.
Severe TMJ pain.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Difficulties carrying out normal life activities because of the pain and headache problems. Lower jaw becoming more retruded.

B444's problems began when she was about 15 years old when her jaw started to click and pop of unknown etiology. Six years ago, her orthodontist treated her for one year and during this time the popping and clicking stopped. She did wear a splint for a while 5 years ago. Her problems have been getting continuously worse. Three months ago, she was placed in another splint. She tries to take physical therapy two times per week since then and finds that it helps her some but obviously does not correct the problem.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Vicodin 1 tablet every other day.
Robaxin 3 tablets per day.
Yaz (BCP)
She rates her headaches that occur pretty much throughout her head at a level of 10. She rates her average TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain 9, jaw function 3, diet at 5, disability at 9. She gets earaches, tinnitus and vertigo. Other joints that bother her include just her fingers. She does have a history of ovarian cysts. She has had previous sinus surgery and she had her adenoids removed as a child. The mandible has become receded since the onset of her problems and her mother relates that even in the past two years it is more noticeable.

In the frontal view, B444 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 5.5 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much aligned on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline may be about 1 mm to the right as is the chin. B444 has a lip incompetence of 10 mm. As she closes her lip she has hyperfunction of the mentalis muscles. Upper lip is retruded maybe 2 to 3 mm and chin is retruded about 10 to 12 mm. Chin-neckline is short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. She does have a head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, B444 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has a 3 x 3 retainer. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a slight Class II cuspid relationship on the left side by maybe 2 mm but closer to a Class I on the left side. She has about ½ mm vertical overbite. Transversely, the right maxillary cuspid seems to be about ½ mm lower than the left cuspid. Intraorally, soft tissues look healthy. Uvula and soft palate appears relatively normal. Faucial pillars appear mild to moderate in constricture. Intranasally, the septum is deviated a little bit off to the right side with a little spur at the base. Turbinates are moderate in size.

A little bit more constricture of the airway on the right side as compared to the left side but not real significant. She does not have any snoring problems that she is aware of nor sleep apnea symptoms. She does have some mild to moderate daytime somnolence. She does have some difficulties breathing through the right side of her nose particularly when she is running. If she does get stuffy the right side appears to get blocked up before the left side. Maximal incisal opening is about 27 mm but she can open to about 24 without severe pain. She can go about 7 mm in excursive movement just briefly and could not hold it by any means and it was quite painful for her to go into these movements. To palpation, she has high moderate to severe pain over the posterior neck, shoulders, right SCM, right masseter, right TMJ and bilateral temporalis muscles. She has moderate pain over the left masseter and left SCM.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Condyles appear arthritic. Articular eminences appear a little bit flat. Nasal septum appears deviated off towards the right side. Turbinates appear moderate in size.

Waters view shows that the bony septum is deviated off towards the right side. However, the right nasal airway appears much more open than the left side does. Turbinates appear to be moderately enlarged. Sinuses appear clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic. Appears to be somewhat sclerotic in the head of the condyle and it appears to have lost some vertical volume. Some anterior beaking is present. Decreased superior and posterior and posterior joint spaces. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic. It appears to have lost vertical volume. A little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening, the condyle translates a fair amount to where the condyles come down almost beneath the articular eminence.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B444 has anterior vertical maxillary excess, and probably some mandibular prognathism. AP microgenia though she has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 4.5 mm to 5 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue in one area it appears to be constricted to 2 to 3 mm. She has some significant lip incompetence of about 10 mm. She has overangluation of lower incisors. Manipulating her models it appears she may have a mild tooth size discrepancy particularly with the overangulation of the lower incisors. She otherwise fits fairly well into a Class I cuspid molar relationship.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis with dislocated non-salvageable discs.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Anterior vertical maxillary excess. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. 

High occlusal plane angle.
AP microgenia. Overangulated lower incisors. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Severe TMJ pain. Severe headaches. Moderate to severe myofascial pain.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract.
CT scans of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxilla superiorly, posterior aspect inferiorly and correct the occlusal plane angle.
Bilateral coronoidectomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Anterior mandibular Medpor graft.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B444  MRI EVALUATION
Age: 21/F
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation:
There are no coronal views available.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There is anterior beaking. There is flattening on the head of the condyle and a little bit of sclerotic bone. There appears to be significantly decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced sitting beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there is restricted translation. The articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction and severely deformed. There is questionable salvageability of this disc. Significantly decreased joint space with the possibility of bone-on-bone contact. This could be indicative of the perforation through the bilaminar tissues.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that likewise shows significant arthritic changes. There is anterior beaking. Flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. There is moderate angulation to it. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Disc is a little bit more identifiable as compared to the opposite side. On opening, there is restricted translation. There is sclerosis evident in the head of the trabeculae that appears somewhat sclerotic. This is anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with significant degenerative changes with questionable salvageability. Right TMJ severe arthritis and dislocation without reduction although possibly salvageable compared to the opposite side.
