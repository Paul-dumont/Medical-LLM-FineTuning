B428 
B428 is here for presurgical evaluation. I previously talked with her and her mother on the phone last year. B428 is currently 22 years old. She initially injured her jaw 3 years ago when she was on a wake board and hit her chin quite hard with her knee. Her jaw joints began clicking and popping after that. Then she had a skiing accident where she was knocked unconscious last year. She began splint therapy last year and has had about 10 adjustments on her current splint. She also has had physical therapy for several months.

When B428 was younger, she had orthodontics from about of 6 to about the age of 14. She currently takes the following medications:
Zoloft 100 mg q.d.
Birth control pills.
Percodan, about 1 tablet per day.
Tylenol.
Naproxen.
Ibuprofen.

She rates her headaches at a level of 8 throughout the head and neck area. She rates her TMJ pain at 9, average daily pain at 9, jaw function at 9, diet at 9, and disability at 8. She gets earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching her teeth at night.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B428 has a little more fullness in her right masseter muscle area compared to the left side. Upper lip length is about 17 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is zero. The maxillary midline may be fairly close to being on the facial midline, maybe just slightly to the left about 1 mm. The mandibular dental midline is also just slightly to the left 1 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much aligned with each other. The nasal tip may be just slightly off to the right side about 2 mm. In profile view, B428 has some AP maxillary deficiency of probably a good 4 to 5 mm. The chin is retruded by probably 12 to 15 mm. The chin neckline is short and the chin neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B428 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. There is some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. There may be some slight over angulation of the lower incisors. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She is just slightly Class I cuspid relationship by maybe 1 mm or so. She has an anterior deep bite of about 2.5 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues all look relatively healthy. The right turbinate appears somewhat enlarged. The left turbinate appears relatively normal in size. To palpation, she has severe pain over the styloid areas, masseters, and TMJs and moderate pain over the temporalis muscles. She has milder pain over the SCMs, posterior neck, and shoulder areas. Maximal incisal opening without severe pain 25 mm, but only to about 10 mm without significant pain. Excursion movement to the right 3 mm, to the left 2 mm, but this also is very painful.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Condyles appear a little bit arthritic. The right turbinate appears enlarged. Coronal view shows that the right turbinate is extremely large and blocks most of the airway. Sinuses appear relatively clear. The left turbinate appears more moderate in size. Axial view shows that the right turbinate is extremely large, but the sinuses are clear. The septum appears reasonably straight. Left TMJ coronal view shows that there appear to be some arthritic changes within the joint and some areas of erosion. The vertical joint space is decreased. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 3 to 4 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has some degenerative changes associated with it. There is significantly decreased vertical joint space with what appears to be almost bone-on-bone contact. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has significant hockey stick shape to it. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is fairly steep. There may be some degenerative changes in the condylar head, particularly towards the medial side of the joint. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with a significant hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is quite steep. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is AP maxillary and vertical maxillary deficiency. Upper lip length is somewhat short. The mandible is AP deficient. There is a moderately high occlusal plane angle. The oropharyngeal airway is significantly reduced with an AP dimension of only about 3 mm (normal 11 mm). At the base of the tongue, the airway dimension is only about 5 mm (normal 11 mm). There is a relatively high occlusal plane angle, but basically a Class I skeletal type relationship. Upper lip appears somewhat short in vertical length, and the anterior aspect of the mandible may be vertically short. Transversely, the occlusal plane is fairly level.

Basic diagnoses for B428 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reduction but with frequent closed lock. AP maxillary hypoplasia.
Posterior maxillary hypoplasia.
AP mandibular hypoplasia.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm at the soft palate level and 5 mm at the base of the tongue. Hypertrophied turbinates, particularly on the right side.
Severe TMJ pain. Severe headaches. Severe myofascial pain.
Moderate high occlusal plane angle.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics has already been underway with alignment and leveling of the arches. Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular discs repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible approximately 10-12 mm at pogonion. Turbinectomies. External rhinoplasty.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Of significant interest is that she works a lot with birds and I did warn her about the possibilities of developing a reactive arthritis secondary to Chlamydia psittaci. I answered all the questions that B428 and her mother and grandmother had today. She is to have a history and physical done later today and consent form reviewed as well as her lab results. She is ready for surgery tomorrow.

Date of Interpretation:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little more difficult to distinguish compared to the other side, probably because of its extreme narrowness. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There appears to be discal tissue anteriorly and laterally displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows that the condyle appears to have fairly good mediolateral width, but there is decreased joint space vertically and particularly laterally. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears very narrow anteroposteriorly. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and appears degenerated. There appears to be tissue surrounding it. The articular eminence is fairly steep. Medially, the condyle is extremely narrow anteroposteriorly. In the T2 films, the disc not really seen, but there is fluid surrounding the disc in both compartments. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in a reduced position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that likewise is very narrow and pointed towards the medial aspect. Out lateral, there is a little bit better width and better contour. The articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is fluid in both joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reduction on opening.

Date of Interpretation:  

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have reasonable morphology. It appears there is discal tissue present, but there may be some reactive tissue surrounding the disc. The condyle has fairly good mediolateral width. The disc appears to be medial and anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit smaller. There appears to be decreased joint space. The disc is not as readily identifiable. The disc does appear to be anteriorly displaced and there does appear to be fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. Joint space out laterally is decreased more than the vertical joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is very narrow anteroposteriorly and quite small compared to the AP width of the fossa. The articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation and disc and the disc is in a reduced position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is very narrow and middle part of the joint but out lateral has a little bit better width. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced sitting down towards the inferior aspect of the eminence. The articular eminence is fairly steep. There appears to be some fluid in the joint spaces. On opening, the disc reduces and has fairly good translation of the condyle and disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs dislocated with reduction
