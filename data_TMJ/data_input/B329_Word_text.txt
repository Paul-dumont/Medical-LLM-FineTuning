B329  MRI AGE: 52/f
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have undergone significant resorption. There appears to be loss of condylar volume vertically and anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination to it. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is foreshortened in the anteroposterior dimension. Condyle appears to be displaced posterior. The disc is quite degenerated and deformed. On opening, there is mild translation of the condyle. The articular disc remains anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed. In some views, there is some anterior beaking on the condyle. Highly questionable salvageability of the articular disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the anterior head and anterior beaking present. There is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle and some peaking of the condyle. Articular eminence has a mode inclination. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and severely degenerated. It appears to be almost folded on itself with the anterior band being folded posteriorly towards the thickened posterior band. In other areas, the disc appears as though it is a round ball. The condyle is somewhat posteriorly positioned in the fossa. On opening there is significant restriction of the translation, and the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. Highly questionable salvageability of the disc, although it may be slightly more salvageable than the opposite side.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis being worse on the left side as compared to the right side and with bilateral articular disc dislocation without reduction and severe degeneration and deformation of the articular disc.

B329 
B329 is 52 years old, referred by Dr. __. B329 is in good health except for her jaw problems. She currently takes 2 medications:

Doryx for rosacea. Concerta for attention deficit problems.
B329 is aware of having jaw joint problems as early as the age of 9 when she was aware of clicking and popping in her joints. Problems as she got a little bit older got a little bit worse and at the age of 33 she underwent 3 ½ years of orthodontics. She has been on splint therapy for 15 to 18 years and has had at least 15 different splints. She has been to physical therapy for years. She has been on numerous medications to try eliminate and help her pain problems. She currently does not take any pain medication as she found it was not really helping. She has taken lots of Advil in the past and she also has tried Tramadol without success. She currently is seeing a pain specialist in . She is seeing Dr. __ for pain management.

The primary concerns that B329 has include the following:
Severe TMJ pain. Severe headaches. Severe difficulties eating and chewing.
B329's physical therapist is __ and he is in .

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B329 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 1 mm. The maxillary midline appears to be pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm off to the left side as is the chin. In profile, she has good AP facial balance with perhaps some slight vertical deficiency. Intraorally, B329 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. It appears she has a large number of tori present. The anterior teeth, particularly the cuspids and the incisors, showed significant wear. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. B329 has a slight transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being about 1.5 to 2 mm higher than the right side. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has about a 2 mm anterior deep bite relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues look as though they have normal anatomy and look healthy. She has extremely wide fascial pillars and the soft palate appears to have significant movement between it and the posterior pharyngeal wall. Nasal airway appears relatively normal. Maximal incisal opening without severe pain is 20 mm. Excursion movements are approximately 10 mm in each direction. To palpation, she has very high moderate pain over the TMJs, moderate pain over the retromandibular areas, and mild pain over the temporalis and shoulders. On opening, she has palpable crepitus in both joints.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has crowns on all 8 molars. The sinuses appear clear. Both joints appear arthritic, affecting both the condyles and the fossas. Axial views shows that the sinuses are clear, septum is straight, and turbinates are of normal size. Coronal view likewise shows that the septum is straight, sinuses are clear, and turbinates are normal in size. Right TMJ coronal tomogram shows that she has advanced arthritis in this joint with osteophytic formation as well as areas of erosion present. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. There is decreased vertical joint space and there are some areas where it appears that there is bone-on-bone contact. Left TMJ coronal view shows that there is loss of condylar height and volume on this side, more so than the opposite side. There is decreased superior joint space, and, at the lateral aspect of the joint, it appears that there is probably bone-on-bone contact. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat curving inferiorly about 1mm or so. Left TMJ sagittal view shows that this condyle is quite smaller than the opposite with evidence of loss of vertical and anteroposterior volume. The articular eminence is moderate in inclination. Joint space is decreased towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Right TMJ sagittal view shows that there is an osteophyte extending up from the condylar head and the presence of degenerative changes. There is a little anterior beaking present. In some areas, it appears that the osteophyte off of the condylar head may be occluding against the bone of the fossa, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is fairly good AP balance, and oropharyngeal airway looks good. She has a skeletal Class I and occlusal Class I relationships.

Basic diagnoses for B329 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis.
Vertical maxillary hypoplasia with the left side being greater than the right side.
Mandibular hypoplasia and vertical asymmetry with the left side being higher than the right side.
Severe TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain.
Significant dental attrition, particularly on the anterior teeth.
Nocturnal and daytime clenching and bruxism.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol). Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction, slight mandibular advancement and transverse leveling using TMJ Concept total joint prostheses. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Maxillary osteotomies with bone plate stabilization and grafting. Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to lengthen the chin.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5. Restorative dentistry to rebuild the teeth.
