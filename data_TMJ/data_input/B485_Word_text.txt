B485 
She is 50 years old. Referred by Dr. XX. By history, it appears that B485's TMJ problems may have begun as early as her teenage years, but in her twenties she became aware of clicking and opening noises in the joints. She believes that when she was younger she had a better jaw balance and then became aware of her chin being deficient in her teenage years. She underwent orthodontics in 29 to 31 years ago. She had upper first bicuspids and lower second bicuspids removed. She has also had her wisdom teeth removed.

B485 has continuous headaches at about a level of 8 in the frontal and temporal areas. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 7, diet and disability at 6. She gets occasional earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. She has some hearing loss. No other joints bother her, but she has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. She is aware of clenching at nighttime and also during the day. She takes the following medications:

Naproxen two tablets per day that she is taking for her recent episode of pain in her lower left ribs that they think may be associated with fracture from coughing from bronchitis. Vivadot 0.5 mg 1/2 patch.
Prometrium. Prozac 40 mg q.d.

She has mild snoring and on occasion has awakened herself snoring. She has moderate daytime somnolence. She reports no evidence of sleep apnea. She believes that she is predominantly a nasal breather when she sleeps.

In frontal view, B485 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm off towards the left side as is the chin. The lower dental midline and chin are fairly well aligned with each other. The nasal tip is 3 to 4 mm off towards the left side. In profile, the upper lip and maxilla are retruded about 10 to 12 mm and the chin is retruded about 20 to 25 mm. The chin neckline is short and chin neck angle is not defined. She does have a head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, she is missing the lower mandibular second bicuspids and maxillary first bicuspids. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the left side of probably 3 to 4 mm Class II and on the right side to a lesser degree of about 2 mm Class II. She has an anterior deep bite of about 5 to 6 mm. Transversely, the occlusal plane is fairly level. She does have a vertical orbital dystopia with the right eye being maybe 2 mm higher than the left eye. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Intranasally, the septum is reasonably straight, although there is a little bone spur off to the left side of the nose. The turbinates appear moderately large in size. Nostrils are somewhat narrow. To palpation, B485 has some moderate tenderness over the temporalis, masseters, retromandibular areas, and the right TMJ. On opening, she had some glitches in the joints. The maximum opening is 45 mm, opening without significant discomfort 31 mm. The excursion movements were 9 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and the mandibular second bicuspid and maxillary first bicuspids. She has crowns on most of the molar teeth. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged. Sinuses look relatively clear. Bony septum looks reasonably straight.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit small in size anteroposteriorly and maybe vertically. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows that there is some flattening of the condyle anteriorly at the lateral aspect of the joint. The condyle is posteriorly positioned with a decreased posterior and superior joint space. There is increased anterior joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The lateral aspect of the rim curves inferiorly fairly significantly. There is decreased joint space at the lateral rim of the fossa.

Coronal view shows that the septum is fairly straight. She does have fairly large turbinates. The sinuses appear clear.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The turbinates appear fairly large with a diminished airway space.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a severely retruded maxilla and mandible. Upper lip supralabrale is almost 10 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxillary incisors are actually angled slightly posteriorly and the lower incisors may be slightly over angulated. The oropharyngeal airway measures 3 mm at the soft palate level and also at the base of the tongue, whereas normal airway dimension is 11 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B485 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations of approximately 30 years duration.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion.
Anterior deep bite of 6 mm.
Missing maxillary first bicuspids, mandibular second bicuspids, and all four third molars. TMJ pain. Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Decreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 mm (normal AP dimension is 11 mm).
Vertical inclination of maxillary incisors.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Sleep study.
2.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Open 1 mm of space between the upper lateral incisors and cuspids. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
3.	CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
4.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement (approximately 24 mm at pogonion) with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). c.	Bilateral coronoidotomies. d.	Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise ~ direction. e.	Partial inferior turbinectomies.
5.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B485 GLOVEN MRI 
DOB:  
DATE OF ACQUISITION:  
Only T2 images are included in the study.
Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit arthritic. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced with fluid above and below the disc. The disc appears to have reasonably good morphology however. On opening, the disc reduces, but there is some restriction in translation of the condyle and the disc. The disc appears to have an adhesion from the posterior band to the roof of the fossa.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little more progressive arthritis than the opposite side. There appears to be a little bit of erosion on the head of the condyle. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting along the posterior fossa. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle is sitting posterior in the fossa. On opening, the condyle appears to reduce onto the disc, although there appears to be some fluid posterior to the disc. Translation is restricted.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Image quality is not good so it has hard to determine where the disc is.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The joint space appears decreased.
IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis being worse on the left side with articular discs anteriorly displaced to a greater extent on the left side but with reduction on opening bilaterally. Translations of the condyle and disc are restricted.
