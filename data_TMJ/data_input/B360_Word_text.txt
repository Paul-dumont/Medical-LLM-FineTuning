B360 
B360 is 64 years old and referred by Dr. _.
Patient History
B360 has had a previous appendectomy, hysterectomy, and hemorrhoid surgery. She also at the age of 10 or 11 had polio. She also has fibromyalgia and migraine headaches. She also has degenerative arthritis. She has degenerative disc disease in the lower back. She has had previous problems with anemia. She has thyroid problems, and she has low thyroid hormone.

She has had adverse reactions to PENICILLIN AND SULFA AS WELL AS #5 YELLOW DYE.
Other joints that bother her include her neck, lower back, occasionally her shoulders, her wrists, her knuckles are enlarging in her hands, her hips, knees, feet, and toes. Sometimes her feet will draw up. She has earaches, tinnitus, occasional vertigo, and hearing loss particularly on the left side. She has had hearing loss since a long time ago with unknown etiology. She has a history of clenching and bruxing nocturnally. B360 gets headaches in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area at about a level of 8 on the left side and probably a level of 7 on the right side. Her TMJ pain on an average day is about 5 but can escalate easily to 9. Her pain on an average day is about a level of 7. She rates her jaw function at 7, diet at 9, and disability at 8.

Current Medications
Fiorinal #3 with codeine
Diazepam 2 mg. Sometimes she has to take 5 mg
Ultram 50 mg
Lortab 7.5 mg taken at night to help her sleep
Armour Thyroid
Paxil
Glucosamine/chondroitin Imitrex
Amitriptyline 25 mg q.h.s.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B360 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted just about 1 mm to the right. Chin is pretty much on the facial midline.

In profile view, she has fairly good facial balance. Some AP deficiency in the chin area, but otherwise structures appear to be in reasonable balance.

Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has crowns on the second bicuspids through the second molars. Has adequate attached gingiva. Some mild crowding, lower anterior arch.

In the upper arch, she is missing the right second and third molar. She has crowns on the remaining three upper molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship and about 1-mm overbite relationship.

To palpation, she has some moderate discomfort over the temporalis muscles, TMJs, left shoulder, and high moderate tenderness over the right SCM and right posterior neck. Her pain does cycle from side to side, and at times it will be worse on one side, and then it will be less on that side and be more intense on the other side.

On opening, she has significant crepitation in both joints, but it is audible in the left TMJ. Maximal incisal opening is 35 mm, but she only opened about 10 mm without having significant discomfort. Excursive movements to the right are about 8 mm and to the left 7 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex reveals the sinuses appear clear. Right turbinate appears a little bit enlarged, and the left one is fairly small. Missing all four third molars and the maxillary right second molar as well as mandibular left first molar replaced by a bridge. Apparently B360 did have an upper partial to replace the missing maxillary right second molar, but she left it out for a while, and then it did not fit. She has root canals on the maxillary right cuspid, second bicuspid, and first molar.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears small in size and appears it has lost vertical dimension. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. Some anterior beaking is present. Condyle appears narrow anteroposteriorly.

Left TMJ tomograms show severe arthritis in the left condyle with loss of condylar substance. Condyle is very narrow anteroposteriorly. Severely decreased posterior joint space. Some beaking of the condylar head. Degenerative changes within the condylar head. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

In open views, it shows that there is restricted translation bilaterally; however, clinically she seems to have good translation, although there appears to be decreased joint space between the condyles and the articular eminences. Both articular eminences just have moderate inclination to them.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are all clear. Left maxillary sinus is larger than the right maxillary sinus. Nasal airway looks good. Turbinates appear moderate in size.

Cephalometrically, she appears to have a high occlusal plane angle and some retrusion of the maxilla and mandible. She has significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway of only about 2 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue about 5 mm.

Oropharynx appears clear; however, the posterior faucial pillars appear to attach into the posterior pharyngeal wall area, and the distance from the soft palate to posterior pharyngeal wall is extremely short. Uvula actually is relatively normal in size.
Patient Concerns

Headaches TMJ pain
Neck pain, shoulder pain, and back pain
Cervical problems
Difficulty eating and chewing
Eating frequently generates headaches Talking causes pain and headaches Sleep disorder
Severe snoring
Apneic episodes when sleeping
Daytime somnolence
She is aware of the fact that she sometimes wakes up at night unable to breathe.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and severe degeneration of the articular discs with perforations
Mandibular hypoplasia
Slight AP maxillary hypoplasia
Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia
Class I occlusion
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of 2 mm (normal is 11 mm)
High occlusal plane angulation
Missing mandibular left first molar (replaced by a pontic) and maxillary right second molar as well as all four third molars
Earaches
Tinnitus
Hearing loss
TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Sleep apnea
Severe snoring
Daytime somnolence

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch. Consider stripping lower anterior teeth to keep from flaring them any further forward and worsening the occlusal relationship

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ condylectomies, reconstruction, and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward in a counterclockwise direction
Bilateral coronoidectomies
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvested from abdomen)

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B360  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: Date of Reading:
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears to have undergone significant resorption. This is very narrow mediolaterally. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. Significant downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. In fact, it hooks back in toward the neck of the condyle. It covers the entire head of the condyle. This could possibly be heterotopic bone, and it could be associated with an ankylosis. On some of the view, there is virtually no joint space, particularly around the lateral wall of the joint.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is very sclerotic as was the other side. Significant decreased joint space. The condyle is very small with evidence in both joints of significant condylar resorption. Lateral rim of the fossa curves downward around the condyle and again extends well down toward the condylar neck of the condyle. In some areas there appears to be major loss of joint space which could be indicative of ankylosis. Difficult to identify discal tissue on these views, although there are some views that it appears there may be some displaced discal tissue.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has undergone some resorption. There is flattening on the anterior head. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is an increased joint space particularly toward the medial side. There is some evidence of discal tissue present, but it is severely deformed and very narrow anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.

T2 films show significantly worse arthritis being present with an osteophyte extending up from the condylar head in the mid head portion that is fairly significant.

On opening, there is very minimal translation. The condyle remains in the depth of the fossa.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle which is small in size. Evidence of significant resorption is present. There is an osteophyte extending off the posterior head. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Posterior joint space is significantly decreased. Difficult to identify any discal tissue, but it appears that there is some over medially.

On opening, there is a little bit greater translation on this side than the opposite side but still quite constricted. Very difficult to identify distal tissue on this side.

Impression:
Left TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and nonsalvagable disc
Severe right TMJ arthritis with articular disc dislocated medially and degenerated
