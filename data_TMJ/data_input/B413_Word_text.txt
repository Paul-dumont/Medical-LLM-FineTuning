B413 
B413 is 20 years old, referred by Dr. XX. B413's TMJ problems began he was about 17 . He was a wrestler in high school and this may have caused some injury to his jaws and jaw joints. He had orthodontics from 6 to 8 years ago with Dr. XX. He had rhinoplasty last year and hand surgery 2 years ago. During the orthodontics, he had a maxillary expander device placed. He has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo. He rates his TMJ pain at 4, average daily pain at 6 which is predominantly in the base of the neck area. He rates his jaw function at 5, diet at 0, disability at 2. He takes the following medications:

Lexapro 20 mg q.d.
Vyanse 60 mg q.d. (for ADD).
Solodyne 145 mg (for facial condition).
B413 is aware of clenching and bruxing at night time, but does not believe that he does that during the day.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B413  has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 1 mm. The nasal tip is a little bit off to the right side about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline and chin are just a little bit off towards the left side about 1 mm at the incisor and maybe 2 mm at the chin. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale. He has a C-shaped curve to the upper lip. Maxillary appears to be probably at least 6 mm AP deficient. The lower lip appears retruded by probably 8 to 10 mm. Chin appears relatively normal in AP position, but is extremely strong relative to the rest of the lower jaw. Chin neckline may be just slightly short in length. Chin may be about 5 mm AP deficient. As B413 postures the lower jaw forward, it improves his facial balance, particularly the upper lip is filled out and the chin is a little bit too strong, but the lower lip is in much better position. Intraorally, B413 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. The lower incisor appears to be leaning backwards. He has some stripping of his lower anterior teeth. Roots may be tipped out buccally a little bit. Teeth look as though they are excessively vertically inclined. In upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars and is basically a Class I relationship with a crossbite on the right side and a crossbite on the left side. The crossbite is greater on the left side than the right side. There is about a 1 mm overbite. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal. Right tonsil is just slightly enlarged compared to the left side which is relatively normal. Intranasally, the turbinates appear normal in size. The septum anteriorly is deviated off towards the right side causing maybe some mild restriction on the right side. To palpation, he has some mild tenderness over the masseter muscles, TMJs, and posterior neck area. On opening, joints seem to function reasonably smoothly. On excursion movement, he could elicit a consistent click on the right joint. The left side seemed to remain relatively smooth. He does have a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower anterior arch.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and the presence of a 3 x 3 mandibular retainer. The left sinus appears a little bit cloudy compared to the right side. It is difficult to evaluate the joints. There are some small dense bony areas around the first bicuspids and left second bicuspid. Waters view shows that there appears to be a deviated nasal septum with maybe a spur going off towards the left side back in the bony section. Turbinates are relatively small. It does appear that there is adequate airway in both sides of the nose. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Joint space appears reasonably well balanced. Articular eminence is moderate in inclination.
Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is slightly postured forward in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. It is possible that B413 may not have been in centric relation for this radiograph. On opening, there is good translation of both joints. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that it appears B413 has AP maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia, but with AP macrogenia. Oropharyngeal airway space appears decreased particularly at the soft palate level where the AP dimension only appears to be about 2 to 3 mm and at the base of the tongue appears to be about 7 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B413 would be as follows:
Transverse and AP maxillary hypoplasia. Mandibular AP hypoplasia. AP macrogenia. Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocations.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm (normal 11 mm).
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Periodontal defects especially of the lower anterior teeth.
Decreased curve of Wilson mandibular posterior arch. Slight tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1 to 2 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Periodontal evaluation and treatment with probably grafting of the lower anterior arch. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Open 1 mm of space between the upper laterals and cuspids. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward and expand it proximally 10 to 12 mm. Anterior mandibular horizontal ostectomy to reduce the AP prominence of the chin.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5. Restorative dentistry to build up the maxillary lateral incisors.

B413  MRI  
AGE: DOB:
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to be fairly good size. Difficult to judge joint space, but it seems a little narrow out lateral. It appears that the disc may be medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. There may be decreased bilateral joint space. The disc may be medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view out laterally the disc appears thin and may indicate medial displacement. More medial the disc appears to be in good position. Joint space particularly vertically appears almost excess. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The shape of the condyle actually appears reasonably good.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking present. The disc appears to be in reasonable position. Joint space appears relationship normal.

Left TMJ T2 view shows fluid in the superior joint space. Right TMJ T2 also shows a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.
Left TMJ on opening appears to have moderate translation of the condyle and disc, and the disc appears to be in reasonable position. Actually, on wide opening, there is translation of the condyle out almost beyond the articular eminence. In the right TMJ on opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in a reduced position on wide opening.

IMPRESSION: Possible bilateral medial displacement of the articular discs.
