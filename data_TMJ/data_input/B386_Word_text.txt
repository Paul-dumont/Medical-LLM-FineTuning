B386 
B386 is 40 years old and referred by Dr.  .
Patient History
She has had problems with kidney stones in the past and asthma. Previous surgeries include tonsillectomy and lithotripsy. She has not had an asthma attack in two years as long as she stays on her allergy medications. She has rheumatoid arthritis that affects her neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, fingers, ankles, and feet. Walking causing major increased pain in the right TMJ. She does have a history of anemia problems and takes medications for that. She does have occasional nocturnal clenching and bruxism. She reports no sleep apnea symptoms and no difficulties breathing through her nose.

She rates headaches that occur predominantly in the temporal area at a level of 4 on the right side and 2 on the left side. These occur 1 to 2 times per day and usually develop after she has eaten. She rates her TMJ pain on the right side at a level of 6 and on the left side at a level of 4. Overall pain on a daily basis averages about a 4. Jaw function is 6, diet at 7, disability at 5.

Current Medications
She takes the following medications:
Nexium 40 mg q.d. Allergra 60 mg b.i.d. Lodine XL 500 mg b.i.d. Robaxin 500 mg ½ tablet b.i.d. Tylenol Arthritis 2 to 3 times per day.
Slow FE b.i.d.

Patient Concerns
Primary concerns that B386 has include the following:
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Muscle pains and spasms.
Difficulty eating and chewing.
Teeth don't fit together well.
Earaches and ringing in the ears.
Jaw jerks from side-to-side secondary to muscle spasms.

She does experience occasional numbness and tingling kind of sensations in her cheek areas. She has seen Dr.   and also Dr.  . Dr.  didn't have any suggestions, and Dr.  suggested an arthrocentesis.

Clinical Evaluation
In frontal view, B386 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mg. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary, mandibular, and chin midlines all pretty much align with the facial midline.

In profile, she has fairly good balance, although maxilla and mandible may be retruded approximately 4 to 6 mm.
Intraorally, she is missing lower probably the first bicuspids. Teeth appear to show a lot of decalcification present throughout almost all of them. Some inflammation in the gingiva. In the upper arch, she is also missing first bicuspids. Also has a lot of decalcification in the upper teeth as well. She appears to have very close to a Class I cuspid-molar relationship with about a 1-mm overbite relationship. Intraorally, oropharynx appears clear. Posterior faucial pillars have actually an anterior attachment in the lateral pharyngeal wall area, and it appears to be that there is a significant anteroposterior dimension between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall area. Nasal airway also looks good. Some slight constricture perhaps of the luminal valves but for the most part looks good, and she has no complaints about her nasal airway.

To palpation, she has moderate pain over the styloid areas and TMJ areas and milder pain over the temporalis, masseters, SCMs, and shoulders. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly. Maximum incisal opening is 40 mm, but she could open probably about 30 to 34 mm without too much pain. Excursive movements are about 9 mm in each direction. On excursive movements, she did have some significant pain in the right TMJ in both directions.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of four bicuspids, and it appears it is all the second bicuspids that are absent. All four second bicuspids are missing as well as all four third molars. She has root canals, mandibular left first molar, right second molar, and maxillary bilateral lateral incisors. Nasal airway looks reasonably good. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Condyles appear as though they are quite large but do show some bony changes present.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear, and nasal airway appears adequate.
Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is postured forward in the fossa. May be some degenerative changes associated with the top of it but difficult to tell.

Left TMJ tomogram likewise shows a condyle postured forward in the fossa. Has an unusual shape to it and appears to have long dimension anteroposteriorly. Condyle sitting down on the lower portion of the articular eminence. Increased posterior joint space.

Open view shows good translation of both condyles. Styloid processes appear a little bit long.
Cephalometrically, she has a skeletal Class I relationship, although both maxilla and mandible may be slightly posteriorly positioned. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures about 8 mm and at the base of the tongue may measure about 8 mm. Occlusal plane angle looks relatively normal.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ rheumatoid arthritis (right side greater progression than the left side).
Severe TMJ pain.
Severe headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Earaches.
Tinnitus.

Recommended Treatment
Evaluation at the environmental center to rule out hypersensitivities to the materials to be used in the prostheses
CT scan of TMJs and jaws (TMJ Concepts protocol)

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ condylectomy, meniscectomy, debridement, and reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prosthesis.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from abdomen).
Application of arch bars.

Restorative dentistry for complete dental rehabilitation
Continued management of her rheumatoid condition
B386  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: 

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral dimension. Some medial beaking is present. Appears to be increased joint space. May be some discal tissue present, but there may be a pannus around that disc. Appears to be some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Condyle appears quite long in anteroposterior dimension compared to the opposite side. It appears that there may be areas of erosion in the fossa, and small areas of perforation could be present.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit narrow mediolaterally as compared to the opposite side. Appear to be some degenerative changes occurring on the top of the condyle. A little bit of sclerosis is present. Appears to be adequate joint space. There appear to be some areas of bony defect in the roof of the fossa. In other areas, the roof is extremely thin compared to the other side. It appears there may be significant erosion in the fossa.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology. There is some flattening on the anterior head. Increased posterior joint space. Disc is in somewhat of a vertical orientation. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Could be a pannus of tissue around the articular disc. On the T2 films, there appears to be some osteophytic development off the top part of the condyle and some anterior beaking.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is undergoing degenerative changes. Articular disc appears that is may be anteriorly displaced, and there may be a Pannus of tissue around that disc. Appear to be significant degenerative changes occurring within the joint. Appears to be some erosion on the condylar head and erosion up in the fossa area. In some areas, the floor of the fossa is extremely thin. The disc, however, appears to be anteriorly displaced but with some kind of reactive tissue above the top of the condyle. On the T2 films, there is anterior beaking, and an osteophytic formation on top of the condyle appears to be present.

Impression:
Left TMJ arthritic changes with articular disc in fairly good position but with the pannus of tissue surrounding the disc.
Right TMJ arthritic changes on the condyle and in the fossa with anterior displacement of the articular disc but what appears to be reactive tissue filling the joint space superiorly and posteriorly.
Findings are compatible with a generalized condition of rheumatoid arthritis.
