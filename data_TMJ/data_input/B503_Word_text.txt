B503
B503 is 30 years old. She has had previous surgical treatment for endometriosis and she also has had a previous rhinoplasty. B503's problems began about 8 years ago with some neck issues. She became aware of popping in her jaw joints in about 4 years ago of unknown etiology. Primary concerns she has are as follows:

Clicking and popping in her jaw joints. Popping in her ears. Headaches. TMJ pain. Difficulties eating and chewing.
Earaches. Sleep apnea symptoms.
Myofascial pain.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: In frontal view, B503 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. In profile view, she may have just some slight AP maxillary deficiency of about 2 to 3 mm. Mandible is retruded by probably about 10 mm. Chin neckline is somewhat short. She has a head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, B503 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She basically has a Class I cuspid molar relationship and an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. Oropharyngeal shows that the tissues appear relatively healthy, but the uvula is moderately enlarged. The soft palate appears relatively normal and fascial pillars appear relatively normal as do the tonsils. She has moderate snoring. She has severe daytime somnolence. She does not wake up unable to catch her breath, but she wakes up a lot at night. She may be predominantly a mouth breather at nighttime, but tends to breathe more normally through her nose during the day. Intranasally, the turbinates appear moderate in size. She has a little bit of spurring at the base of the septum off to the right side. She has collapse of her nasal valves being to a much greater extent on the left side. She can breathe well all through the left side, however, holding the nasal valves open with the scope enabled her to breathe relatively easy through the nose. She has severe airway obstruction on the right side and moderate on the left side. She has a deviation of the septum at the base with some spurring off to the right side. Turbinates are relatively normal in size. She has severe decreased functional nasal airway on the right side and moderate on the left side due to collapse of the nasal cartilages as a result of the previous rhinoplasty. Columella is moderately wide and nostrils are mildly restricted. Luminal valves are significantly restricted with the right side greater than left side. To palpation, she has high moderate to low severe pain through most of the head and neck area except in the left temporalis and masseter area and medial pterygoid. Maximal incisal opening is 27 mm, but only about 19 mm without significant pain. Excursion movement to the right 9 mm and to the left about 7 to 8 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars impacted. The sinuses look relatively clear. No other pathology noted. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of peaking on the top of the condyle. Articular eminence is significantly steep. Joint space appears to be slightly decreased vertically. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is slightly posteriorly displaced. Articular eminence is steep. Imaging of both left and right TMJ tomograms is compatible with anterior dislocation with vertical orientation of the articular disc. On opening, there is good translation of the condyles as they move forward beneath the articular eminence. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B503 has a retruded maxilla and mandible. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 6 to 7 mm at the base of the soft palate and about 7 to 8 mm at the base of the tongue. There is a moderate high occlusal plane angulation. Maxilla and mandible appear retruded.

Basic diagnoses for B503 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations.
AP maxillary hypoplasia.
Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Collapse of the lateral nasal valves secondary to previous nasal surgery with the left side being significantly worse than the right side.
Nasal airway obstruction.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Sleep apnea symptoms.
TMJ pain. Headaches.
Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. b. Align and level mandibular arch.
2. Surgery. a. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla and down graft it posteriorly. d. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e. Reconstruct lateral nasal valves with lateral nasal spreader grafts.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B503 MRI
AGE: 31/F DOB:
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. In fact, the lateral pole of the condyle extends lateral to the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with a downward curvature of probably only about 1 mm. There is a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. The joint space is narrowed. The disc may be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is slightly large and the lateral pole extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of fossa curves inferiorly about 1 mm. The joint space appears somewhat decreased, although there may be some discal tissue in the joint space, but also anterior.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is a little sclerosis on the anterior portion of the head and some slight anterior beaking. There may be some cortical changes on the top of the condyle in some views. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of peaking of the condyle which extends slightly upward behind the posterior band of the disc. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space on the posterior aspect of the fossa. On opening, there appears to be early reduction in relation to the condyle and articular disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis on the superior and anterior head of the condyle with a little bit of peaking. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced just beyond the peaking of the condylar head. The articular eminence has moderate inclination. The disc appears slightly more displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint as compared to medial. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. On opening, there is early reduction and good translation of the condyle and the articular disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with early reduction.

AGE: DOB:

Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation:
Coronal view shows the presence of hypertrophied turbinates. Sinuses look clear. Left condyle appears moderately large. There is decreased superior joint space. The lateral pole extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears excessively large and the lateral pole extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There is a decreased vertical joint space.

The sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The condylar morphology looks reasonably good.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that anatomically looks reasonably good. Articular eminence appears steep. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space.

Axial view shows that the turbinates are enlarged. The septum looks relatively straight. The sinuses appear clear. The condylar heads appear extremely wide.
