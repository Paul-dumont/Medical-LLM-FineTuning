B280 
B280 is 55 years old and is referred by ___.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Constant pain in the jaws, neck and back. Jaw sometimes gets stuck.
Popping and clicking in the jaws.
Bites inner cheek.
Jaw aches on the left side.
Tongue pressure on the right side.
Her teeth presses against her cheek.
Sore throat.
Sinus problems. Eye pain and blood shot. Cranial pain. Extreme difficulty in working. Chronic fatigue. Terrible headaches.

Her objectives are to get free of pain and help decrease or eliminate other symptoms. She would like to regain her former lifestyle and be able to function normally and enjoy life.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Ginseng and Ziziphus, plus several other Chinese herbs.
Green magma angelica.
Provigil 20 mg.
Valtrex p.r.n. Lyrica occasionally.
Triamcinolone cream for rash.

She has significant difficulties taking a lot of these drugs because it makes her get bloated and constipated.
Her TMJ problems may have begun in childhood where she was aware of jaw sounds and they continued to get worse over the years. During the past year, however, they have gotten significantly worse.

PREVIOUS TMJ TREATMENTS: Physical therapy since 23 years ago until last year.
Spints. She has had many splints over the years. She has had at least six splints over the years. Orthotics in her shoes.
Acupuncture continuously. The acupuncture treatments began at least 7 years ago.
Chiropractic treatment for over 20 years.
Reiki for at least five years.
Craniosacral therapy for 10 years. Anti-inflammatories were used around 20 years ago and also last year. She still continues to use those periodically but it causes her GI problems. Muscle relaxers. She was also on those around 20 years ago and also last year. They also caused GI problems. Massage for over 20 years and said it does help but only temporary.

PREVIOUS SURGERIES: Appendectomy 48 years ago.
Tonsillectomy 34 years ago.
Wisdom teeth removed 33 years ago.
Morton neuroma in 31 years ago.
She was involved in a car accident 25 years ago and she hit her head and her jaw on the steering wheel at that time. Etiology of B280's problems is unknown. She did have an MVA 25 years ago where she hit her mandible and forehead. She was in another minor accident 6 years ago where she backed into a car and may have felt a little bit of a whiplash.

Her jaws currently feel very tired and achy. She gets a burning sensation. She feels as though her tongue is pushing her lower jaw off to the right side. She does get a feeling of locking. She gets earaches, tinnitus, vertigo but no hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her hips, knees and shoulders. She has chronic fatigue problem and it seems to be getting worse. B280 feels she is getting a head postured forward neck position that she did not have before. She has had some changes in her right foot where she gets some numbness involving primarily the side of the big toe. Her headaches without any treatment are at level of 10 predominately in the left forehead and center of the head as well as the right temple, back of the head, top of the head and behind the left eye. She rates her TMJ without treatment at a level of 10, average daily pain at 10. After acupuncture, chiropractic treatment etc., the pain may drop down to 8 but this does not last more than 48 hours. She rates her jaw function on the average at about a 9. She rates her diet at a level of 3 and her disability on an average about 9. She feels that her disability is continuing to get worse. She gets pain in her chest area from the sternum lateral up through her shoulder and down through the upper part of the left arm. Usually in the morning she is all stuffed up in her nose and sinuses. She does the pressure point treatments and this seems to improve her situation. She is not sure if she snores. She has daytime somnolence that is severe and chronic. She is not aware of sleep apnea. She does not know if she wakes up unable to catch her breath. She does wake up frequently at night. She tosses and turns a lot. Her sister has been diagnosed as having sleep apnea.

In frontal view, B280 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is -1. Maxillary, mandibular and chin midlines are all pretty much aligned with each other. In profile view she has fairly good facial balance. There may be just slight AP mandibular deficiency but not too significant.

Maxilla may be back just a touch but again not real significant. Chin-neckline is a little bit short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B280 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some moderate crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has crowns in the mandibular right first and second molar and left first and second molars. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She is very close to being Class I cuspid molar relationship. She has a crossbite on the right side in the second bicuspid area. She has about 2 mm vertical overbite. She also has a crown on the maxillary right central incisor. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and normal. Intranasally, the septum deviates a little bit off to the right side. Turbinates are moderately enlarged moreso on the right side than the left side. There may be some obstruction present. To palpation, she has high moderate to low severe pain over the TMJs, high moderate pain over the styloid areas and shoulders, moderate pain over the medial pterygoids and milder pain over the temporalis and posterior neck muscles. On opening, she has significant noises in her joints with opening pops probably at about 15 mm on the right side though it is a soft one and on the left at about 20. Closing clicks are fairly close to being about 10 mm. On wide opening when she moves her jaw, there is crepitus noise present. At times shen she lays down she will get jittering of her muscles and teeth where the will open and close rapidly making clacking kind of noises with the teeth. Maximal incisal opening is about 48 mm. Excursive movements about 10 mm in each direction. She can open about 15 mm and be reasonably comfortable but beyond that she develops significant pain and discomfort.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has root canal on maxillary right central incisor and mandibular right first molar. She has crowns on all four molars in the mandible and maxillary left first molar. Condyles appear to have reasonable confirmation. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Waters view shows that she has a bony spur off the septum into the right nasal airway. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Anterior joint space is increased. Condyle actually has fairly good confirmation.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is a little bit posteriorly positioned in the fossa. The condyle has a little bit of flattening on the posterior head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The joint space is actually better on this side than the opposite side. The condyle has a little bit altered morphology compared to the opposite side. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles particularly on the right side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows she has basically a skeletal and occlusal Class I relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 9 mm at the soft palate level and about 8 mm at the base of the tongue. In the chin area I see a white round area but I believe that is just an artifact on the film as there appears to be nothing clinically present.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reduction.
Relative mandibular hyperplasia.
Severe headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Severe TMJ pain.
Earaches, tinnitus and vertigo.
Deviated nasal septum.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Nasal airway obstruction. Sleep disorder. Chronic fatigue. Crowding lower anterior arch. Maxillary right cross bite in the second bicuspid area.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
MRI of left and right TMJs with sedation (Valium 5 mg tablets x2 prescribed.)
Medications.
Klonopin 0.5 mg tablets dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x5.
Magnesium 225 mg tablets, 2 tablets daily.
Presurgical orthodontics (if patient elects orthodontic approach.)
Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies with rigid fixation. Application of arch bars (if patient decides against orthodontics.)
Turbinectomies (by Dr. __.)
Nasoseptoplasty (by Dr. __.)
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion (if patient elects orthodontic treatment.)

The patient could not undergo MRI today because of claustrophobia. We will try again later today to see if we can accomplish it. I gave her a prescription for Valium 5 mg tablets dispensing 2 tablets, take 1 tablet 45 minutes prior to scheduled MRI and take second tablet if necessary. She is to call me in one week to let me know if the Klonopin is helping her. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

B280  MRI EVALUATION
AGE: 55/F
DOB: 
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There appears to be some discal tissue displaced medially and anteriorly. At the lateral aspect of the joint and anteriorly the disc appears to be laterally displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit wide and almost extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There is discal tissue medially displaced and likely anteriorly displaced as well.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good confirmation. Articular disc is prominent at the lateral aspect of the joint and is anteriorly displaced. More medial the disc is in a little bit better position. Medially the top of the condyle appears uncovered by the disc. The disc is in actually good condition. Articular eminence is moderately steep. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not too much. On opening, there is early reduction of the disc and there is good translation of both the condyle and the disc forward with them both coming anterior to the articular eminence. Significantly decreased posterior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has more morphological changes as compared to opposite side. There is flattening on the posterior head of the condyle and on the anterior head. A little bit of anterior beaking is present. A little sclerosis also present in the cortical bone around the top of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint but more medially it appears to be in better position. At the far medial side of the joint the disc is not seen. The disc appears to be in fairly good condition. There is decreased posterior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space moreso than the opposite side and a little bit in the inferior joint space as well. On opening, there is early reduction of the disc and there is good translation of both the condyle and the disc.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated but with early reduction.
