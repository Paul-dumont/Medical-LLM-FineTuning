B028
B028 is 38 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX.
B028 was diagnosed with JRA at the age of 5 with an onset estimated to be around the age of 3 years old. The first joint to be affected with her right knee. She has never had pain or any symptoms associated with her TMJ joints, although the other joints have resorbed away. The primary concerns that B028 has include the following:

Lower jaw is severely retruded. Severe snoring. Pain and stiffness through the neck.
Sleep apnea. Constricted airway.
In frontal view, B028 has a little bit of increased fullness in the right side of her face compared to the left side by only probably 2 to 3 mm at the most. Upper lip length is 28 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is zero. The maxillary and mandibular dental midline as well as the chin are fairly well on the facial midline. The maxillary is retruded about 3 to 4 mm and chin is retruded 30 to 35 mm. There is no chin neck angle or chin neckline. She has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. She has a 2 mm anterior open bite. She has orthodontic appliances on her teeth. The teeth are pretty much aligned and level. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship, being probably about 3 mm Class II on the left side and probably 4 to 5 mm on the right side. The maxillary left cuspid may be about 1 mm posterior to the right cuspid. The mandibular dental midline and chin may be about 1 mm off towards the right side. There is a slight transverse cant in the occlusal plan with the left cuspids being about 1 mm higher than the right cuspids. She appears to have a tooth size discrepancy. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy, but the soft palate appears somewhat elongated and appears to be in very close approximation with the posterior pharyngeal wall. The fascial pillars may be somewhat constricted. Intranasally, the septum may be deviated a little bit off towards the right side. The left turbinate is extremely large and fills most of the nasal airway. The right side is mildly enlarged at least anteriorly. She probably has mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction. The nostrils are moderately narrow. To palpation, she has some mild to moderate discomfort over the temporalis muscles, TMJs, retromandibular areas, and shoulders. She has crepitation in the joints on function. Maximal incisal opening is 43 mm, excursion movements to the right 7 mm, to the left 6 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has root canals on the maxillary second bicuspids, mandibular left second bicuspids and second molar. She has severe arthritis in the TMJ joints. She has significant prominent antigonial notching at the inferior borders of the mandible.

Coronal view shows that she has hypertrophied turbinates particularly on the right side. The septum is deviated off towards the right side. There is a little bit of thickening to the sinus membrane on the floor of the right maxillary sinus.

Axial view shows that the septum is deviated a little bit off towards the right side. Turbinates appear huge, being greater on the left side than the right side and appear to block off the majority of the functional nasal airway.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that has severe resorption. The condyle is actually functioning anterior to the articular eminence. There is severe loss of vertical dimension.

Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show severe condylar resorption and flattening of the condylar head with major loss of volume. The condyle is functioning anterior to the articular eminence.

Left TMJ coronal view shows that there is essentially total destruction of the lateral rim of the fossa. The condyle is postured high on the lateral aspect of the remaining fossa. The whole slope of the fossa is at about a 30 degree angle. The condyle is very narrow mediolaterally and vertically.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has also undergone severe condylar resorption with decreased joint space in some areas. The condyle is functioning anterior to the fossa. The condyle is very narrow mediolaterally and has some osteophytes extending off the medial side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B028 has a retruded mandible. She has a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway measured at the soft palate measures 3 mm and at the base of the tongue measures about 3.5 to 4 mm.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Bilateral TMJ severe condylar resorption as well as resorption of the articular eminence and lateral rims of the fossa.
Severe mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of approximately 3 mm (normal 11 mm).
High occlusal plane angle of 24 mm (normal angulation 8 degrees).
Class II end-on occlusion.
Anterior open bite.
AP microgenia.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Nasal airway obstruction.
Sleep apnea.
Tooth size discrepancy.
TMJ pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2 mm of tooth structure and retracting.
2. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
3. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction and advancing pogonion 21 mm. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the incisor tip forward about 3 mm and down graft it posteriorly 9 mm. c.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.	Bilateral coronoidotomies. e.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. f.	Augmentation genioplasty of approximately 12 mm.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B028 MRI AGE: 38/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a joint that is severely deformed and degenerated. It appears that there is some kind of condylar process present that extends out lateral to the lateral rim of the fossa. There really does not appear to be much of a fossa on the left side. There is no condyle really to speak of. Condylar element is severely deformed.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is very narrow mediolateral. There is loss of significant volume. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly only about 1 mm. There is some joint space present, but there is no evidence of discal tissue. The condyle looks severely degenerated.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is severely deformed. There may be some kind of structure in the joint. There also appears to be a condylar element towards the medial side of the joint. There is no articular eminence present. There is an amorphous type of tissue that appears to be present in the joint space, more on the medial side of the joint. On opening, there does not appear to be much translation of whatever elements are within the joint.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a severely degenerated condylar element. The condyle appears to be postured forward almost anterior to the articular eminence. There are very small fragments of condyle remaining. The articular eminence is extremely flat. There appears to be some amorphous soft tissues within the joint space.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe destruction of all joint elements of the condyles, articular discs, and articular eminences.
