B298  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: Date of Reading: 
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle where the lateral pole is significantly higher than the medial pole. Appears to be a little outgrowth of bone at the lateral pole area. Significantly decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly positioned. Cortical bone appears to be intact both on the condyle and in the fossa. Joint space is greater toward the center medial aspect of the joint than the lateral aspect.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good width. Poles are approximately across from each other. A little lateral extension around the lateral pole. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount but slightly less than the opposite side. Decreased superior and lateral joint space. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced. Cortical bone appears intact in both fossa and condyle.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has a little bit of peaking out at the very lateral aspect of it. More medially it looks a little bit more normal, although there is some flattening and a little osteophyte sticking up off the top of the condyle in the midcondyle area. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced more toward the lateral aspect and a little bit better position over medially. Decreased posterior joint space. Some flattening of the posterior head of the condyle as well. Some anterior beaking toward the medial aspect of the condyle. There appears to be some fluid in the superior joint space. Disc is thickened particularly at the posterior band.

On opening, there is fairly good translation, and the disc appears to reduce.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is a little bit narrow anteroposteriorly out laterally but medially has a more normal anteroposterior dimension. Some anterior beaking is present toward the medial aspect. The articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and somewhat thickened at the posterior band. The posterior joint space is decreased. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

On opening, there is fairly good translation, and it appears that the disc does reduce.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Both discs appear salvageable

B298 
B298 is 19 years old and referred by __.
Patient History
B298 has had previous surgery for a tonsillectomy and ear tubes. B298 is in good health with no major medical problems. She had a reaction to CECLOR when she was younger. B298 has had previous orthodontics by Dr. __. She had appliances placed when she was in the third grade, and they were removed when she was in the seventh grade. Following completion of B298's orthodontics, her bite actually fit together fairly well. It was when she was in her freshman and sophomore year in high school that the jaw began to shift and the bite subsequently changed as well. When her bite did start to change, Dr. __ put her back into further treatment, trying to use headgear and other kinds of devices but did not correct the problem.

B298 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She had known allergies to CECLOR AND PROBABLY TO MILK PRODUCTS. Also, she probably has a significant reaction to NICKEL as she cannot wear any type of cheap jewelry because of hypersensitivity. Also, even snaps on clothing can cause her to have a significant reaction. She has been diagnosed with scoliosis and strabismus. She has a high pain tolerance, so any pain problems are not as evident for B298 as in most other people. B298 is also very much aware that she breathes primarily through her mouth particularly when she sleeps. She is not aware of nocturnal or daytime clenching or bruxism. Patient Concerns
Teeth and jaws don't fit together very well
Gums are getting inflamed because of excessive exposure
Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B298 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 6 mm. When she smiles, she shows about 4 to 5 mm of gingiva. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted about 2 mm off to the right side as is the chin.

In profile view, B298 has a little bit of a bump on her nose. She has an obtuse nasolabial angle. Upper lip supralabrale is probably a good 4 to 5 mm posterior to subnasale. Maxilla is probably 6 to 8 mm AP deficient. Mandibular neckline is extremely short, and chin-neck angle is not well-defined. Chin may be approximately 15 to 20 mm AP deficient.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Some mild crowding. Some calculus on her teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. Actually her third molars are peaking through in the upper arch. She has a Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally being approximately 4 mm Class II on the left side and probably almost 6 on the right side. She has probably a 4-mm overjet relationship. Vertical overbite relationship is about 0. Oropharynx is clear, and soft palate and uvula appear relatively normal in size and shape.

Intranasally, her turbinates are enlarged quite a bite compared to the width of the nose which is probably causing some airway obstruction.
She appears to have an accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch.

To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Joints seem to function reasonably smoothly, although she felt she could hear a little bit of something in there.

B298 gives no history of headaches. She rates her TMJ pain and overall pain at 0, jaw function at 2, diet and disability at 0. Incisal opening is 50 mm. Excursive movement to the left is about 8 mm and to the right about 8 mm.

Relative to the pupillary plane, the transverse occlusal plane appears relatively parallel, but relative to the ears, there is a little bit of vertical asymmetry. It could be that the ears may be just a little bit off vertically from each other.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderately large. All the teeth are present and accounted for. Mandibular third molars are impacted, and the maxillary third molars appear to be just slightly erupted. Condylar heads look relatively normal.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with significantly decreased posterior joint space. Articular eminence is quite steep and has a very vertical orientation to it with an increased anterior joint space. Disc could possibly be in a vertical orientation in that area.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that looks a little bit different. Condyle appears much wider than the opposite but with a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and some vertical peaking. Posterior joint space is significantly decreased in size, but anterior space is increased. Articular eminence on this side is almost as steep as the opposite side with an increased anterior joint space indicative of perhaps an anteriorly positioned articular disc in a vertical orientation. Translation is good in both joints with the condyles coming out beyond the articular eminence.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are relatively clear. The turbinates appear to fill up most of the nasal cavity. Asymmetry in the lower jaw is noted.

Cephalometrically, she has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship. She has vertical maxillary excess. Oropharyngeal airway is decreased with it being about 5 mm at the soft palate level and 5 mm at the base of the tongue which is half of normal dimension. A little bit of adenoid tissue present in the nasopharynx area but probably not significant enough to interfere with the airway. Turbinates extend back to the posterior aspect of the hard palate but not beyond. Occlusal plane may be slightly increased. Appears to be a cant in the transverse occlusal plane level with one side being higher than the other, and this also is evident at the inferior border of the mandible as well.

Basic Diagnoses
Anterior vertical maxillary excess
AP maxillary deficiency
Transverse maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular deficiency
Class II occlusion

Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with probably early reduction
Accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch
Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1.5 mm

High occlusal plane angle
Hypertrophied turbinates
Nasal airway obstruction
External nasal deformity

Recommended Treatment
MRI of left and right TMJ
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch at two occlusal plane levels. Place a vertical step between the cuspids and lateral incisors to align the four incisors at an elevated plane level. Tip the lateral incisor roots mesially and the cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Do not use straight wire technique as this will extrude the maxillary incisors and may create orthodontic instability
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 1.5 mm of tooth structure to compensate for the tooth-size discrepancy. Be sure to place brackets onto the second molars to help improve their alignment as well

Surgery
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly, advance it, and expand it
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance it in a counterclockwise direction
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Bilateral inferior turbinectomies
External rhinoplasty

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
