B343 
B343 is 17 years old. She was referred by ___.
B343 does have a history of asthma and she has to use an inhaler before she works out. She was hit in the nose with a Frisbee as a child. 5 years ago she fractured her left elbow and had pins placed and then removed a couple of months later. 3 years ago she had just one wisdom tooth removed.

MEDICATIONS: Singulair 10 mg daily p.r.n.
Albuterol inhaler p.r.n. before exercise.
Zyrtec 10 mg 1 per day.
Advil, Tylenol, or Aleve for headaches.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Noises in the right jaw joint.
Teeth do not fit together very well at all.
Difficulty eating and chewing.
Thumb sucking when she is sleeping.

B343 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She also had some hayfever problems, pollen problems and perhaps maybe some allergies to animal dander. She has no problems wearing jewelry. She gets headaches that she rates at about a level of 2 that occur daily and they include her entire head. At times, the headaches can escalate to 10. Usually when they begin, she will take either Advil, Tylenol or Aleve and this keeps them from getting worse. She rates her TMJ pain at 5 with the right side significantly worse than the left side. She rates overall facial pain and headaches at a level of 5, jaw function 5, diet 7, disability at 4.

In frontal view, B343 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm off to the right side. Chin is probably about 3 or 4 mm off to the right side. Mandibular dental midline and chin are pretty much on the facial midline. Profile view shows a slight C-shaped curve to the upper lip. It may be about 2 to 3 mm AP deficient in the maxilla. Chin may be 8 to 10 mm AP retruded. Chin-neckline may be just slightly short but not too significant. Chin-neck angle is fairly well defined. Intraorally, B343 has all of her teeth back to the second molars present. She has a little bit of space between the lower central incisors. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has a right-sided posterior crossbite. She has a Class II cuspid relationship. She appears to have small upper lateral incisors. On the left side, she is just a slight Class II by may be 1 to 2 mm. She has an overjet of about 3 mm. She has just a slight open-bite tendency with about may be 1/2 mm vertical overlap. She still has her tonsils. B343 

They are actually quite large. She does not report problems with recurrent sore throats, however. The uvula, soft palpate and faucial pillars look good. The only constriction in the oropharynx is the relatively large tonsils. Intranasally, the septum is deviated just a little bit off towards the right side but not too significant. Right turbinates appear fairly small. Left turbinates appear moderate in size. Does not appear to be any significant airway obstruction. Columella is moderately wide but nostrils appear adequate. There does not appear to be any significant nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, she has very severe pain over the TMJs and right styloid area as well as the right masseter. She has moderate pain to palpation over the right temporalis, left masseter, left styloid area and mild tenderness over the posterior neck and left temporalis area. On opening, she has an audible pop on the left side about 20 mm and a loud audible pop at about 40 mm on the right side. On closing, she has an audible pop on the right side at about 10 mm and a palpable closing pop on the left side at about 5 mm. Incisal opening is 57 mm. Excursion movements are about 12 mm in each direction. As B343 shifts her mandible a little bit towards the left side about 2 to 3 mm it improves her facial balance.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence all four third molars. Lower teeth appear fairly well aligned and level. A little space between the central incisors. Root position is fairly good. In the upper arch, the first bicuspid and second bicuspid root tips are all rotated towards each other particularly on the left side. First molar and second molar roots are tipped towards each other creating large spaces between the roots of the second bicuspid, first molar bilaterally and between the cuspids and lateral incisors. Also, between the central incisors is a fairly large space. Sinuses appear relatively clear. The sinuses dip down quite significantly between the roots of the molars and bicuspids. The condyles appear to have a reasonable shape to them.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good morphology but with some flattening on the anterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking noted. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The anterior joint space is increased.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good morphology with maybe just some slight flattening on the anterior head. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both condyles. In the open views, the styloid processes appear somewhat elongated but difficult to tell. The right one seems longer than the left one.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are quite large but appear reasonably healthy. There could be a mucocele in the right maxillary sinus. Left turbinate appears significantly larger than the right side. It may cause some nasal airway blockage.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B343 has a significantly large adenoid mass at the posterior aspect of the nasopharynx. She has a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship. However, oropharyngeal airway appears fairly good but the distance from soft palate to posterior pharyngeal wall is approximately 10 mm and from the base of the tongue the posterior pharyngeal wall about 8 mm. B343 

MODEL ANALYSIS: Tooth size analysis reveals a Bolton's difference of 1 mm. In a Class I cuspid relationship with proper anterior overbite relationship, there is a slight Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and also a crossbite on that side. Therefore, the transverse dimension of the maxilla is somewhat constricted by probably about at least 4 mm in transverse deficiency.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
AP maxillary deficiency. Transverse maxillary deficiency. AP mandibular deficiency. Class II end-on occlusion being worse on the right side as compared to the left side.
Right-sided cross bite.
Mandibular dental midline shifted 10 mm to the right and chin shifted 3 to 4 mm to the right. Slight transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 1 to 2 mm higher than the left side. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Thumb sucking habit.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch to try to improve the alignment of the marginal ridges between the second bicuspids and the first molars. Place brackets on the second molars to try to get them into a little bit better alignment compared to the first molars. The first molars also could be tipped buccally by about 1 mm or so on each side to improve alignment with the rest of the teeth.
Align and level mandibular arch. Close spacing between the lower central incisors.

Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to expand the maxilla and advance it.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
B343  MRI Evaluation 
Age: 17-year-old female
Date of Birth: 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 

The opening device apparently was placed in the mouth prior to beginning the MRI. Therefore, B343's mandible was postured forward when the MRI was actually performed. Therefore, the MRI is not completely compatible with the findings of the clinical examination.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle which appears to be a good size mediolaterally and vertically. There appears to be decreased joint space superiorly. It is difficult to identify discal tissue. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. Articular disc is very difficult to identify.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to be fairly wide mediolateral. There appears to be some degenerative changes on the head of the condyle with perhaps some sclerosis in the cortical bone. Decreased joint space vertically. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears that there may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Some slight anterior beaking is present. There appears to be good vertical joint. Moderate steepness to articular eminence. Disc appears to be in position. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space at the posterior aspect of the joint. There may be a little bit of fluid in the anterior joint space as well. On opening, there is fairly good translation and the articular disc is reduced is in position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have some flattening on the anterior head. The medial side of the condyle appears small in size. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced. There is a significant amount of fluid in the superior anterior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space posterior to the head of the condyle. On opening, there appears to be a late reduction of the disc. There is a fairly good translation of the condyle and of the disc. Disc may be somewhat thickened and a little bit of foreshortened but appears to be salvageable.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ with very mild arthritic changes but articular disc in position with good translation. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with late reduction.
