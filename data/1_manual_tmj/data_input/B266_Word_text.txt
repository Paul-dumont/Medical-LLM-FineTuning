B266  MRI Evaluation
Left TMJ, coronal view, the quality of the MRI is not very good. Condyle appears narrow mediolaterally but it is very difficult to identify the anatomy of the joint. Appears there must have been a lot of movement present. Appears to be roughness both on the condyle and in the fossa, but again this may be distorted because of movement. On one view, the condyle appears to have fairly good width. Difficult to define any disc tissue.

Right TMJ, coronal view, is similar in poor image quality probably due to movement and difficult to identify presence of the condyle and identify where the disc might be.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with decreased posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep and fairly long. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and positioned beneath the articular eminence. Disc appears to have reasonably good morphology, however, yet. Some anterior beaking is present. Cortical bone on top of the condyle appears somewhat thin.

On opening, she has fairly good translation. Difficult to tell if the disc reduces or not because the image of the disc is hard to identify. Condyle appears somewhat narrow anteroposteriorly. The disc may be nonreducing. Articular eminence itself lights up quite significantly possibly indicative of a large marrow space present. The shape of the condylar head is somewhat unusual.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with significant distortion. Significant anterior beaking and sclerosis are present. Decreased joint space is present. Significantly decreased superior and posterior joint space. Disc is anteriorly positioned sitting beneath the articular eminence. Articular eminence is moderately steep but vertically not as long as the opposite side. No particular inflammatory process.

On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Impression:
Left TMJ articular disc dislocation and morphology deformation of the condylar head itself suggestive of either condylar hyperplasia or osteochondroma.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with significant deformation and possible salvage ability.

B266 
B266 is 17 years old and referred by Dr. __.
Patient History

She has had ear tubes x 3. B266 currently has a sinus infection that has just developed. She has a history of asthma and does use an inhaler for that. She has hypogamma globulinemia.

About two years ago, B266 and her family became aware that her jaw was becoming asymmetrical and growing off to the right side. The problem has been present for about two years.

B266 has some problems with her shoulders, but primarily she has problems with her ankles that are very weak, and her feet also bother her some. She has a history of torticollis, and she did wear a neck brace for a while and had massages for management of that.

She gets headaches about two to three times per week that occur primarily in the temporal and frontal area that register at about a level of 6. She rates her TMJ pain at about 8, although it is not there all the time but quite frequently, overall pain at 9, jaw function at 8, diet at 6, and disability at 6.

She had orthodontic treatment where she was in appliances for approximately six years and had been followed by an orthodontist from about 9 years ago until last year. She was in braces when the mother noticed the facial asymmetry and brought that to the attention of the orthodontist. She was then referred to Dr. __, an oral surgeon, who suggested the braces be removed and B266 just be monitored to evaluate facial growth. He was going to wait until growth was completed and then do some corrective surgery. Current Medications
She takes Omnicef, which she just started for the sinus infection. SULFA medications give her a rash.
Primary Concerns
Primary concerns that B266 has at this time include the following:

Facial asymmetry.
Clicking and popping in the jaw joints.
Inability to open wide.
Earaches.
Some lightheadedness and dizziness.
Headaches.
Pain in the jaw joints.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Difficulties breathing through the nose.
Predominantly mouth breathing particularly when sleeping.
Snoring.
A lot of tiredness and low energy during the day.

Clinical Evaluation
In frontal view, B266 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 3.5 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline may be just slightly to the left maybe 0.5 mm to a millimeter. Left side of the mandible is probably about 8 mm lower than the right side. Some slight increased fullness in the mandibular area on the left side and a little flattening on the right side, probably about a 3 or 4 mm transverse difference.

In profile, B266 is probably about 4 to 6 mm AP deficient in maxillary projection. She is probably about 10 to 12 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline is short, although the chin-neck angle is fairly well defined. B266 does carry her head in a neck postured forward head position. She does have some nasal dorsal prominence. Cheeks have good projection. Lower third face appears a little bit elongated.

Intraorally, actually she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some moderate crowding, lower anterior arch. Lower teeth gingiva is very thin. In the upper arch, she is missing a right permanent maxillary second bicuspid but has a retained primary first molar in place. She also is missing the maxillary right cuspid tooth. These must be congenitally missing as well as her third molars as eh reports not having any teeth previously extracted. She has a slight Class II cuspid relationship on the left side and slight Class III on the right side. She has an anterior overbite of about 1.5 to 2 mm. She has a transverse occlusal cant with the right side being about 3 to 4 mm higher than the left side. Transversely, the mandibular right cuspid is about 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. Likewise, the maxillary right cuspid is 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. The yaw of the maxilla and mandible posteriorly is about 3 mm off towards the left side creating the arch asymmetry and probably accounting for the individual arch asymmetry with the right cuspids being more posterior compared to the left cuspids. Posterior faucial pillars are quite posteriorly positioned, and even when she is relaxed, the soft palate falls fairly close to the posterior pharyngeal wall area. Transverse width of the posterior faucial pillars is somewhat narrow.

Intranasally, the septum is deviated off towards the left side. The left turbinate is of moderate size, but it appears to be kissing against the septum, thus, probably causing significant airway blockage. On the right side, the turbinate is much larger than the left side, but there appears to be adequate airway because of the significant deviation of the septum off towards the left side. Columella is wide anteriorly, and the nostrils are somewhat constricted. Superior end of the lower lateral cartilages curves inwardly and causes some constricture of the nose in about the luminal valve area.

To palpation, she has moderate to very high moderate pain around the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, styloid areas, and milder tenderness to palpation around the medial pterygoids and shoulders. Maximal incisal opening is about 30 mm but without significant pain 24 mm. Excursive movements are less than 0.5 mm in each direction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and maxillary right second bicuspid with a retained primary cuspid. Left sinus appears a little bit cloudy compared to the right side. Difficult to evaluate the turbinates in this view. Right condyle appears a little bit small in size particularly in the condylar head and neck length. Difficult to see the top of the condyle. Left condyle appears enlarged and bigger than normal.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Virtually no superoposterior joint space. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Head may be tipped up quite a ways on this x-ray. This would be compatible with a displaced articular disc. May be a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of unusual shape to it. Appears to have some unevenness across the surface in one of the views. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Joint space appears decreased and posteriorly the posterior joint space in one of the views. This also could be compatible with articular disc dislocation. She demonstrates translation that is greater on the left side than the right side in her opening.

On the open view, there is anterior beaking present on the right condyle indicative of some degenerative changes occurring. Joint space is very narrow on the left side between the condyle and the articular eminence.

On the Waters view, she is in asymmetric posture. Fluid in the left sinus is present compatible with her sinus infection. Nasal septum is significantly deviated off towards the left side. Difficult to evaluate her turbinates because the x-ray is not straight on.

Cephalometrically, transverse occlusal plane looks fairly good. She may have had her head tilted a little bit when this x-ray was taken. Appears to have a retruded position of the maxilla and mandible. Head is tipped upwards. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue level is probably only about 3 or 4 mm and the same dimension at the soft palatal level.

Basic Diagnoses
Left TMJ osteochondroma versus condylar hyperplasia and articular disc dislocation.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Significant transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 3 to 4 mm higher than the left side.

B266 
The patient and her parents came in for further consultation. I last saw B266 on this year. She has been diagnosed with Kallmann's syndrome that also has a Gn-RH deficiency. She has never had any menstrual periods. The mother said the facial asymmetry goes along with this syndrome, and they also have long, thin fingers, long arm span, and weak ligaments. They also have learning disabilities. I do have some information on that and will review that syndrome. She worked at Starbucks for a while but is so tired from her four to five hours of work that it is overwhelming for her. She had to quit her work because she was too tired to keep up the pace. The sleepiness could be coming from the sleep apnea problems. She rates her headaches at a level of 6 in the frontal and temporal areas, TMJ pain at 7, overall daily pain on the average at 5, jaw function at 8, diet and disability at 7. Her headaches can escalate to 10. Sometimes she wakes up with them, and other times they begin during the day or can even begin at night or get worse at that time. She has fairly constant headaches. Maximal incisal opening is 30 mm, and she could open about 30 mm without too significant pain. She could not voluntarily go into any excursions. Occlusion seems to be remaining about the same with basically a Class I occlusion. To palpation, she has high moderate to low severe pain around the temporalis, masseters, medial pterygoids, TMJs, and styloid areas. She has mild to moderate pain to palpation around the SCMs and posterior neck and shoulder areas. She takes Motrin and occasionally will take Prevacid for acid reflux. Other joints that bother her include her knees and her ankles. The knees just started to be a problem of significance since December. She does get earaches, and she gets occasionally vertigo but no tinnitus. She has an IgA and an IgG deficiency, and her endocrinologist wants to treat her with gamma globulin injections prior to the surgery. She remains with a slight Class III cuspid relationship on the right side and slight Class II on the left side. She has significant upper arch and lower arch asymmetries with the right cuspids being about 3 mm posterior to the left cuspids. Mandible and maxilla have about a 3-mm yaw off toward the left side. She continues to have her nasal airway obstruction problems. Her pain has gotten worse for her, and she now would like to proceed on and get her treatment completed. We need to check with Dr. __ to make sure that he is satisfied that we could proceed on with treatment. She could be done earlier than the tentatively scheduled time from my standpoint but will need to make sure that Dr. __ agrees.

Other Systems
Other joints that bother her include her knees and ankles. She has had a few urinary tract/bladder infections. She recently had some surgery to remove a membrane in her vagina. She had some bleeding problems after that surgery, but everything is fine now. That was done I believe in December. Reproductive system: She has never had a period, and this is secondary to her Kallmann's syndrome. She has been diagnosed with gingivitis in the past. She has a lot of problems with pink eye and gets an infection annually and periodically has had sties. She gets frequent sinusitis. She gets earaches and occasional vertigo. She gets frequent ear infections. Sometimes she will have problems with recurrent sore throats but feels this may be allergy related. She has had bronchitis x 4, and she had pneumonia once at the age of 13. She does have some problems with constipation and does have acid reflux. Did not question her about STDs. She does have a lot of problems with fatigue. No significant exposure to birds, except she had one dog I think when she was quite little that in the past had caught some birds. She has had minimal exposure to cats and dogs all of her life. She has had some minimal exposure to hoofed animals including cows and pigs. The family owns a ranch, but she really isn't out much with the animals. She does do some 4-wheeling through the pastures where the cattle are.

B266  CAT Scan Sinus Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of Reading:
Sinus series shows that the frontal, ethmoid, and maxillary sinuses appear quite clear She has a significantly deviated nasal septum off toward the left side. Turbinates are moderately large, but it appears that she has a passable airway.

Left TMJ, coronal view, appears to have significantly decreased vertical joint space. The condyle has fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly 3 to 4 mm. Appears to be a significantly decreased vertical joint space.

Right TMJ, coronal view shows a condyle with an unusual shape to it. There seems to be lateral extension of the lateral pole of the condyle. It extends out underneath the lateral rim of the fossa. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa appears to curve inferiorly about 4 mm. Appears to be some degenerative changes associated with this joint.

Impression:
Normal sinuses
Bilateral TMJ arthritis
Deviated nasal septum
Nasal airway looks clear


RE: B266 
Dear :
I recently have evaluated B266. B266 is 17 years old and has been under orthodontic treatment since 9 years ago. She has been treated by a number of different orthodontists, and she has lived in different parts of the country. Two to three years ago, B266 and her family noticed that she was developing facial asymmetry. She also has had a lot of other TMJ-related symptoms as listed below in her concerns.

B266's primary concerns at this time include the following:
Facial asymmetry.
Clicking and popping in the jaw joints.
Inability to open wide.
Earaches.
Some lightheadedness and dizziness.
Headaches.
Pain in the jaw joints.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Difficulties breathing through the nose.
Predominantly mouth breathing particularly when sleeping.
Snoring.
A lot of tiredness and low energy during the day.

Based on clinical, radiographic, dental model, and MRI analyses, B266's diagnoses are as follows:
Left TMJ osteochondroma versus condylar hyperplasia and articular disc dislocation.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Significant transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 3 to 4 mm higher than the left side.
Class II end-on occlusion on the left side, Class III end-on occlusion on the right side.
Missing maxillary right cuspid and second bicuspid as well as all four third molars.
Retained primary E in the maxillary right second bicuspid area but without any substantial root structure remaining.
High occlusal plane angulation.
Severe decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Nasal septum deviated off to the left side.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Wide columella base with narrow nostrils.
Constricture of luminal valves primarily as a result of inward rotation of the superior aspect of the lower lateral cartilages.
Severe nasal airway obstruction.
Headaches. TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain.
Earaches.
Tinnitus.
Vertigo.
Daytime somnolence.
Sleep apnea symptoms.
Snoring.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics
Align and level maxillary arch. Open about 1 mm of space around each upper lateral incisor to help correct for the tooth-size discrepancy. In the upper arch, the right first bicuspid will be used as the cuspid.
Align and level mandibular arch.

Evaluate for continued growth of the left condyle
Surgery
Left TMJ high condylectomy and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Right TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor and possible removal of anterior osteophytic development on the condyle.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, level it transversely, and decrease the AP occlusal plane level.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction as well as level the transverse occlusal plane.
Bilateral inferior turbinectomies.
Nasal septoplasty.
Reconstruct luminal valves.
Reconstruction of columella base.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
Extract retained maxillary right primary E
Osseointegrated implant to maxillary right second bicuspid area

Dental reconstruction
I do not believe that there are any major movements required orthodontically at this time, except for opening 1 mm of space around each of the maxillary lateral incisors and basically aligning and leveling the other teeth. Tip the upper lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies if they become necessary. I feel that this treatment plan would get B266 the best possible functional and aesthetic result and best chance to eliminate her ear symptoms and eliminate her headache, TMJ, and myofascial pain problems.

If you have any other thoughts or suggestions in reference to her treatment, please give me a call. I very much look forward to the opportunity of working with you in correcting B266's problems and concerns.

With best regards,

cc: B266
