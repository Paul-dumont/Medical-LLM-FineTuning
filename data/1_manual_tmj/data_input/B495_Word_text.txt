B495
B495 is 43 years old and is referred by Dr. XXXX
PRIMARY PROBLEMS:
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Sleep apnea problems. Ear pain.
Feeling of choking.
Difficulty swallowing. Even when drinking water she will choke.
B495 has been diagnosed with acid reflux and recently had a procedure to expand her esophagus to breakup some adhesions. This helped her swelling for a short time but her difficulties are back again.

B495 is not really sure when her jaw joint problems began. She says her lower jaw has always been somewhat retruded. However, she feels it has become much more receded in the past 5 years. She developed sleep apnea problems during the past 5 years. She was placed on a CPAP machine but she is unable to tolerate it. The CPAP machine significantly aggravates her allergies and her aspergillosis, a fungal infection of the lungs. Seven years ago, at about the age of 39, she noted the joint problems progressing. However, it was not until last August that she developed severe pain problems. She was put in physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks and this seemed to help her muscle spasms but has not reduced her pain levels. B495 has had splint therapy for approximately 10 years. This obviously has not corrected her situation.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Ibuprofen 800 mg tablets. She limits herself to 1 a day because it causes GI problems. Q-Var inhaler. Albuterol.
Prednisone periodically as needed for her symptoms.
Nexium.

B495 rates her TMJ pain at a level of 9, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 5, diet at 7, disability at 6. She gets headaches predominately in the right temporal and posterior head area at a level of 7. She gets a headache at least every other day. She does find that she clenches at night and also during the day. She gets earaches worse on the left side than the right side and they are fairly continuous. She also gets tinnitus and she gets occasional vertigo. No other joints bother her. She does have a history of breast cancer that was diagnosed in the fall, 11 years a go. She had a left mastectomy and subsequently had a breast implant placed. She has done well since that treatment.

In frontal view, B495 has some transverse facial asymmetry. She has more fullness on the right side of her face than the left side. Upper lip length is about 3.5 to 4 mm. B495 states that the right side increased fullness may be due to swelling and it tends to become more prominent and less prominent but it stays more full on the right side. B495 says she used to be more symmetric than she is now. It is possible there could be some slight masseteric hyperplasia there. Maxillary and mandibular midlines are fairly well centered. She has lip incompetence of about 6 mm. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 2 to 3 mm. She probably has a maxillary deficiency of probably 4 to 6 mm. Chin appears to be retruded by at least 15 to 18 mm. Chin-neckline and angle are well formed. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. The uvula appears normal size and shape but the soft palate appears elongated with a very narrow oropharyngeal space remaining. Faucial pillars appear normal. She had her tonsils previously removed when she was 7 years old. Transversely the occlusal plane is fairly level. She has some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch. Mandibular left lateral incisor is completely lingually blocked. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Slight division II angulation of the incisors. She has a Class II end-on occlusion being worse on the left side as compared to the right side. She has an overjet of about 4 mm. Anterior vertical overlap of about 2 mm. Oropharyngeal area tissues look healthy. She has severe snoring. She has severe daytime somnolence and could fall asleep while driving and also at work. She has severe sleep apnea symptoms and apparently has significant occurrences of cessation of breathing at night while she is sleeping. Intranasally, the septum appears fairly straight. Turbinates appear fairly large. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the TMJs and mild tenderness over the styloid areas, but no other significant discomfort around the head and neck area. With jaw function, she feels squishy noises in her joints. On reassessment of B495 in centric relation, she is actually very significantly Class II bilaterally. In the first assessment she was postured a little bit off towards the left side. The midlines and chin are all fairly well aligned in centric relation. The overjet is actually about 5 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars, but all the rest of the teeth are present. The sinuses appear reasonably clear. Condyles appear small in size and a little bit arthritic.

Waters view shows that the bony septum has a little bit of deviation in it. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged although there does appear that there may be airspace but all sinuses appear clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows that there appears to be decreased joint space. Condyles appear arthritic. Very difficult to view probably due to small size of the condyles.

Right TMJ tomograms show that the condyle is likely arthritic but there appears to be an increased joint space on this side vertically and the condyle is postured slightly forward. On opening, there is moderately good translation of both condyles with perhaps a little bit more on the right side than the left side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that both the maxilla and mandible are retruded. She has a severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of less than 2 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue is only about 2 mm (normal is 11 mm.)

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis with significant condylar resorption.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. Severe AP mandibular deficiency.
Class II end-on occlusion. Significant crowding of lower anterior arch.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 1 to 2 mm (normal dimension 11 mm.)
Severe sleep apnea (life threatening.) TMJ pain. Headaches. Ear pain and tinnitus. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm. Hypertrophied turbinates. Partial nasal airway obstruction.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth size discrepancy and to help keep the lower incisors from being flared too far forward.
CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, expand it and downgraft it posteriorly.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts.
Bilateral mandibular coronoidectomies.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B495 MRI EVALUATION 
Age: 43/F
DOB:

Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption. Significant loss of condylar volume. The condyle appears narrow with medial beaking. There is increased soft tissue space. The fossa appears in some areas to have a little bit of degeneration but difficult to tell. There is moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of probably about 3 to 4 mm. There may be discal tissue anterior and medial.

Right TMJ shows a condyle that is also quite small in mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There is significantly less joint space on this side compared to the opposite side. There may be some discal tissue anterior in this joint. A little bit more sclerosis on the top of condyle as compared to the opposite side. It appears there may be some degenerative changes in the fossa as well.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant condylar resorption. There are osteophytes remaining on the superior head and anterior on the head of the condyle. There are some degenerative changes in the fossa in some areas. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and severely deformed. It is very short anteroposteriorly and it actually appears like a round ball. Articular eminence is fairly long and steep. There is significant fluid in the superior joint space and the soft tissues are exceptionally thick in the joint area. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle but the disc remains anteriorly displaced and severely deformed. There still remains almost excessive joint space in the open view.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows significant condylar resorption and loss of volume. It appears that the cuts through the joint are done at an odd angle compared to how they are usually done. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Decreased superior joint space. Condyle appears to be posteriorly positioned. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and severely deformed and degenerated. In some areas, the articular eminence appears fairly flat with changes in the fossa with significant degenerative changes of the condyle. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space although not as much as the opposite side. On opening, there is moderate translation and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
1.	Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and severe degeneration of the articular discs.
2.	Probable candidate for total joint prostheses.
