B392 EVALUATION : 40/F
DOB: 
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal views shows a condyle that is fairly enlarged for the size of the fossa. It extends slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Decreased lateral joint space is present. Discs may be medially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite large for the size of the fossa. It may just extend slightly beyond the lateral rim, but not too much and not quite as much as the opposite side. There is decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears to be medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening of the head of the condyle particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. I do not see any discal tissue at the most lateral aspect, but there is discal tissue medially and appears to be in reasonably good position. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc. The condyle has a slight hockey stick shape to it.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that likely has a little bit of flattening at the lateral aspect of the joint. Decreased joint space laterally. Disc tissue not really seen. More medially, the disc appears to be good position. Translations of the condyle and disc are very good.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint and medial displacement of the articular disc.

B392 
B392 is 41 years old and referred by , . The primary concerns that B392 has include the following: Uncomfortable around the jaws and jaw joint area.
Headache.
Eye pain. TMJ pain. Ear pain. Difficult to eat.
Changes in her facial appearance since undergoing previous orthodontic treatment.

HISTORY. B392's TMJ problems began about one year ago when she developed some pain and noises in the TMJ joints of unknown etiology. She had previously had orthodontic treatment from 3 years ago and had her braces removed in 2 years ago. She is unhappy with the result.

B392 gets headaches at a level of 5 in the frontal and temporal area and behind her eyes. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 5, diet at 1, disability at 1. She gets earaches, occasional tinnitus, and she has significant problems with vertigo. She feels that she may have some hearing problems, but her tests come out relatively normal. Other joints that bother her include her shoulders, wrists, hands, fingers, spine, knees, and hips. She has been previously diagnosed with the following conditions:

Ankylosing spondylitis.
Fibromyalgia.
Hashimoto thyroiditis.
Inflammatory arthritis.
She gets significant pain behind her eyes and, even though her vision is good, she gets this significant pain. She is aware of clenching at night time and also during the day time. She takes the following medications:

Topamax 50 mg q.h.s.
Relpax.
Oracea.
Fish oil.
Vitamin D with calcium.
B392 has had both of her children via C section. She had a hysterectomy on , and tonsillectomy 4 years ago. She did have breast implants 9 years ago.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, she has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is just slightly to the left at about 1 mm. Mandibular dental midline and chin are actually pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, there is about a 2 to 3 mm AP maxillary deficiency. The mandible appears to be AP retruded. She has a prominent labial mental fold. The chin appears to be retruded by probably about 4 to 6 mm. Chin neckline is somewhat shortened and chin neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B392 is missing the crown on her mandibular right second bicuspid and may be missing the first molar and the second and third molar have perhaps drifted forward. On the left side, she is missing the lower first molar and the second and third molars have drifted somewhat forward in medial inclination. In the upper arch, B392 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a Division 2 occlusal relationship. She has a full Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and Class II end-on on the left side by about 5 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of probably a good 8 to 9 mm. The entire mandibular crown is covered by the maxillary incisors when she bites together. She has a significant reverse curve of occlusion in the upper arch and an accentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch. She has a buccal crossbite on the right side affecting the maxillary molars and bicuspids as well as the cuspid. Oropharyngeal tissues all look normal. Intranasal structures all appears quite healthy. In the frontal view, the left side of the jaw appears slightly longer vertically than the right side, so the left side is longer than the right side. There is some transverse asymmetry in the upper arch with the right cuspid being about 1 mm lower than the left cuspid, but in the lower arch the lower right cuspids are about 1 to 2 mm higher than the left cuspids. Nasal airway looks normal. She does have a history of some snoring, and she has moderate to severe daytime somnolence. She may have some mild sleep apnea symptoms. She is uncomfortable in the neck and chest area when walking and she is not sure why that is. To palpation, she has moderate to high moderate pain through the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, styloid areas, shoulders, and left . In joint function, the joints function reasonably smoothly, although she could hearing a rubbing like bone-on-bone kind of noise in the right joint and she said she has had this in the left side as well. Maximal incisal opening is 50 mm. Excursion movements in each direction were 8 mm, but this was painful for her. In excursion movements, she could feel a painful grinding nose in the left TMJ. She could open about 30 mm without significant discomfort.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the mandibular left first molar, mandibular right first molar, and on both sides the second and third molars have drifted forward. She has a retained mandibular right second bicuspid, but without a crown. Sinuses look relatively clear. Condyles appear to have reasonably good shape. She has a crown on the maxillary left first molar and mandibular left second bicuspid root. Waters view shows that the bony septum is reasonably straight. Turbinates are moderate in size, and they may be larger posteriorly than they are anteriorly. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. There may be a slight decreased joint space superiorly and posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Joint space may be a little bit narrow superiorly. There is a little bit of flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II jaw position with a probably relatively low occlusal plane angle. She has a Class II Division 2 malocclusion. Oropharyngeal airway actually looks fairly good with an AP dimension of about 10 to 11 mm at the base of the tongue and also at the soft palate level. She has a brachiocephalic facial morphology. Pogonion is strong compared to the AP position of the lower incisors. Tooth size analysis shows she has a 's difference of 1.5 mm, but it is probably greater than that because of the AP dimension of the maxillary incisors which are thick, probably increasing it to about 2 to 2.5 mm. Basic diagnoses for B392 include the following:
Bilateral TMJ ankylosing spondylitis.
Mandibular hypoplasia.
Transverse maxillary hyperplasia.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Class II Division 2 malocclusion.
Anterior deep bite of 9 mm. Left posterior buccal crossbite.
Missing mandibular left and right first molars and a crown of the mandibular right secondary bicuspid.
Reverse curve of occlusion upper arch.
Accentuated curve of occlusion lower arch.
Tooth size discrepancy with a 's difference of about 2 to 2.5 mm. Ankylosing spondylitis.
Fibromyalgia.
Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
Inflammatory arthritis.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Open about 1 mm of space around each maxillary lateral incisors and cuspid. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally in case interdental osteotomies are necessary.
Align and level mandibular arch. Maintain lower spacing in the left first molar area to equal the size of a bicuspid and maintain spacing on the right side to equal the size of a bicuspid in the area of the retained second bicuspid root.
Consider turbos on the maxillary incisors and even possibly on the second molars to open the bite and aid in leveling of the maxillary and mandibular arches. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Bilateral coronoidectomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Possible maxillary osteotomies if necessary to achieve a good functional occlusion.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Dental reconstruction to replace the mandibular left first molar and right second bicuspid.

B392  
Review with Dr. . In review, Dr.  agrees that the discs appear to be medially displaced and there is definite decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. There is also sclerosis at the lateral aspect of the condyle on both sides.

IMPRESSION:
