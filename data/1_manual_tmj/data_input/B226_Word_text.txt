B226
B226 is 13 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B226 is in good health with no major medical problems. B226 does have some asthma problems that sometimes are exercise-induced. He takes Ventolin when needed. He is on no other medications. He does have problems breathing through his nose and one side is pretty much blocked off.

PRIMARY CONCERNS
1. Facial imbalance.
2. Nasal airway obstruction.
3. Predominately mouth breather.
B226 has had orthodontics for about 2 to 3 years but the braces were not placed on all of the teeth, just some of the teeth. B226 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, headaches, TMJ pain or myofascial pain. In frontal view B226 has good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship about 8 mm. Maxillary midline, mandibular dental midline in line with each other. In profile, he has some prominence in the nasal dorsum. The nasal labial angle has pretty good form to it. He has lip incompetence of probably about 10 mm. Cheeks are somewhat sallow by maybe 3 to 4 mm. The lower third face is elongated. Lower lip is everted. The chin appears to be AP deficient by probably about 15 to 18 mm. As he postures his mandible forward, he does have better chin projection. There is a little deficiency in maxillary projection as well. There may be about 3 to 4 mm AP deficient. He does have hyperfunction of mentalis muscle. He has all of his teeth back through the second molars with good attached gingiva. In the upper arch he has all of his teeth back through the second molars present. He has a Class II occlusion with an overjet of about 4 mm. He has a vertical overbite of about 2 mm. The uvula is moderately enlarged. The soft palate may be mildly elongated. The faucial pillars appear fairly significantly constricted. Tonsils are present. The septum is deviated a little bit off to the right side. Turbinates are hyperplastic particularly the left one which is quite large. The nasal airway appears quite constricted. The nasal luminal valves appear fairly constricted. Holding the luminal valves open did not seem to improve his ability to breathe through his nose. He has no tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 50 mm. Excursive movements are 8 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of all 4 developing third molars. The rest of the teeth are all erupted in place. Turbinates appear fairly large. Difficult to evaluate the sinuses. The condyles look relatively normal.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear although the right maxillary sinus appears quite small in size compared to the left one. Turbinates appear to pretty much obliterate the nasal airway. The right side looks larger than the left side at least posteriorly.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be normal in architecture. There may be some anterior beaking. There could be a little bit of decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly reasonable morphology with perhaps a little flattening on top in one area. The joint space looks pretty good. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening, there is good translation of both joints.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B226 has anterior vertical maxillary excess and AP mandibular deficiency. Occlusion is Class II and he is skeletal Class II. Oropharyngeal airway for the most part looks good except he has an adenoid tissue mass in the nasopharynx that almost touches the turbinates. The turbinate extends posterior to the hard palate. There may be 2 mm of airway space between the posterior aspect of the turbinate and the adenoid tissue. He has significant lip incompetence. He has a vertical bite of at least a couple of millimeters. He does have a left posterior crossbite. With a Class I occlusal relationship, the crossbite worsens. There is tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.

BASIS DIAGNOSES
1. Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
2. Transverse maxillary deficiency.
3. AP mandibular deficiency.
4. Class II occlusion.
5. Posterior crossbite on the left side.
6. Hypertrophied turbinates.
7. Nasoseptal deviation.
8. Nasopharyngeal adenoid tissue.
9. Nasal airway obstruction.
10. Impacted third molars x4.
11. High occlusal plane angle.
12. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisal roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b. Align and level mandibular arch. Strip the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract to correct the tooth size discrepancy.
2. Surgery. a. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly and level the occlusal plane angle. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c. Partial nasal turbinectomies. d. Nasoseptoplasty. e. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B226 MRI EVALUATION
AGE:
Left TMJ coronal view shows good mediolateral width of the condyle. There is some decreased lateral joint space. Disc space appears to be medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just 1 to 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The disc appears to be medially displaced with a slightly decreased joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just 1 to 2 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the posterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Disc is not as easily identified at the lateral aspect of the joint as it is over medially. Medially, the disc appears to be in fairly good position. No inflammatory process seen around the joint. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better morphology than the opposite side. There is some slight anterior beaking present. However, the disc appears to be in position. Lateral the disc is a little bit more difficult to see. No inflammatory process is seen in the joint. The articular eminence is fairly steep particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint, a little less inclined more medial. On opening, there is good translation and the articular disc is in a good reduced position.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritic changes and articular disc possibly medially displaced.
