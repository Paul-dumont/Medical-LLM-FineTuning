B461 
B461 is 58 years old and is referred by Dr. XX. B461 is aware of developing his jaw problems about 3 years ago when he developed some pain in the right jaw area. Etiology is unknown. He met with his dentist and with Dr. XX and it was decided that they would try to align the teeth to take some of the stress off the jaw muscles and joint structures. 3 years ago, the orthodontics began. He continues to under orthodontic treatment. He has had nightguards from this year to 3 years ago. Earlier this year, he had a removable splint that he is to wear all the time except at mealtimes and to brush his teeth. B461 gets headaches predominately on the right side that are fairly constant in the frontal, temple and posterior head area at about a level of 5. He rates his TMJ pain at 9, average daily pain at 4, jaw function and diet at 6 and disability at 7.

MEDICATIONS:
Tricor.
Alphagan.
He gets earaches on the right side, tinnitus bilaterally and occasional vertigo. No other joints bother him. He is allergic to sulfa drugs and in the past has had food and environmental, i.e., plants allergies but he feels he has outgrown many of those. He does clench his teeth at night and also during the day. B461 has been diagnosed with glaucoma. B461 does have snoring problems. He does have some daytime tiredness but he is not aware of having any sleep apnea problems.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Severe pain in the jaws.
Intense headaches.
Constant popping in the jaws.
His objective is to relieve his pain and aching teeth problems as well as eliminate his headaches.

PREVIOUS SURGERIES:
Detached retina 12 years ago.
Cataracts in both eyes in 14 and 13 years ago .
Osteomyelitis in the left frontal lobe area for which he had many surgeries from 39 and 29 years ago.

In frontal view, B461 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 28 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about -1. Mandibular dental midline and chin are shifted a little bit off to the left side by about 2 mm. The nose is tipped off the right side about 2 mm. In profile view, B461 has some AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 4 to 5 mm. He appears to be AP deficient by about 24 mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B461  has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars present. Teeth are fairly well aligned and leveled. He has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, B461 has all of his teeth back through the second molars present. B461  has a Class II cuspid molar relationship being about 5 to 6 mm Class II. He has an anterior deep bite of about 3 to 4 mm. As B461 postures his mandible forward into a good incisor relationship, he still is slightly a Class II by probably 2 mm. Probably indicative of a tooth size discrepancy. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. The uvula might be just mildly elongated but soft palate length and faucial pillars all look normal. Intranasally, the septum may be deviated a little bit off towards the left side but not too significant. The turbinates appear moderate in size with the left one being smaller and the right one being somewhat larger. There appears to be good nasal airway at least as best as can tell from the anterior aspect. He has a transverse cant in the occlusion with the left cuspid being about 2 mm higher than the right cuspid. B461 has previously had his wisdom teeth removed. B461 has clicking and popping action in both TMJ joints. Opening click occurs about 30 mm of opening and closing click is probably around 20. He has no tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. Incisal opening is 55 mm. Excursive movement is about 11 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. It also shows the presence of orthodontic appliances on the teeth with the anterior 10 teeth in each arch with clear brackets. There appears to be some arthritic changes within the joints. Sinuses appear relatively clear as best as can be told from these radiographs.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear clear. He has huge frontal sinuses particularly on the right side. Nasal septum is deviated off towards the right side in the bony area but turbinates appear relatively small in size.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle has a hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be good joint space surrounding the condyle. A little bit of anterior beaking present.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a fossa that appears a little bit constricted anteroposteriorly in dimension. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Difficult to tell where the disc would be. Condyle is a little bit broad anteroposteriorly. On opening, there is good translation of both joints.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B461 has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship and a Class II occlusion. He has a high occlusal plane angle morphology. Oropharyngeal airway is quite constricted with the AP dimension at the soft palate level being about 3 to 4 mm and the base of the tongue measures about 7 mm.

Tooth size analysis shows a Bolton's difference of about 2.5 mm.
On reevaluation of the TMJs by putting some light pressure over the right joint and having him open and close, he had significant clicking and popping in the jaw joint compatible with the displacement of the disc. I believe both discs are displaced probably in the lateral direction with the right side being more symptomatic than the left side.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation laterally.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Class II occlusion.
High occlusal plane angle.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Right-sided earaches. Snoring. Tooth discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm. Over angulation of lower incisors.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing approximately 2.5 mm of tooth structure and retract.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors and bilateral arthroplasties. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla some but downgraft it posteriorly and upright the incisors.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

I injected B461's right TMJ with Marcaine 0.5% with 1:200,000 epinephrine. The injection went into the superior joint space. After about 10 to 15 minutes he was pain free in reference to the right-sided headaches, TMJ pain and any other pain on the right side of the face. He has almost a numbing sensation relative to the pain relief but he could feel all the soft tissue structures. Injection was confined just to the superior joint space in the right TMJ. His profound relief of pain symptoms confirms that the pain is related to the TMJs. I elected not to inject the left side at this time.

Date of Interpretation 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. Some osteoarthritic changes present in the joint. Medial in the joint there appears to be some bone with significant marrow in it and a decreased space in this area. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just about 2 to 3 mm. There is some bony osteophytic kind of formation in appearance in the fossa area. The fossa seems narrow somewhat mediolaterally because of this bony development in the medial side of the fossa. There may be discal tissue in place but at the medial pole of the condyle the joint space is significantly decreased and there may be not be any discal tissue there.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Again, there is some bone formation on the medial side with significant medullary bone present. There is decreased joint space at the medial pole area. There does appear to be some discal tissue present but it may be laterally displaced similar to the opposite side. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of only about 2 to 3 mm at the most. It appears there may be discal tissue anterior at the condyle but difficult to tell.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes. Laterally, more medially there is an area at the condyle that appears somewhat arthritic. There is a hockey stick shape to the condyle. Articular eminence is fairly steep. However, it does appear that the disc is in position in most of the views except towards the lateral aspect it appears that the disc may be anteriorly displaced. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the disc and the disc is in a reduced position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is flattened on top and a little bit of anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is not as steep as the opposite side. The disc actually appears to be in fairly good position. Over medially the disc is not as readily seen. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint the disc has a tendency towards being anteriorly displaced. No significant fluid present in the joint. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc is in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis but the articular disc may be in position with good reduction and good translation of both condyle and disc. Right TMJ arthritis but the articular disc appears to be in reasonably good position but could possibly be somewhat laterally displaced.
