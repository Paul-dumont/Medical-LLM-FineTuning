B249
B249 is 19 years old. Birth date is . Referred by Dr. ___. B249 has been diagnosed with having juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. B249  was diagnosed with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 17 months. However, it was only about 3 years ago that the family began noting changes in the jaw position. B249 has no problems with TMJ pain, headaches or myofascial pain. She had previous orthodontics from the age of 8 to about 12 1/2, at which time the lower second bicuspids and upper first bicuspids were extracted. She has had severe resorption of the roots on the maxillary lateral incisors. Few months ago, she began orthodontic treatment again. She currently takes:

Methotrexate 0.6 mg q. weekly.
FiberCon.
She has no trouble with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo. She has problems with her right knee, fingers, ankles, at least one toe. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: In frontal view, B249 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 28 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about zero. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip may be deviated just slightly to the left about 1 mm or so. The mandibular dental midline and chin midline are shifted about 5 mm off to the left side of the facial midline. Upper lip is retruded by about 2 to 3 mm. The chin is retruded by about approximately 12 mm. Chin neckline is moderately well defined. Intraorally, B249 is missing the mandibular second bicuspids and upper first bicuspids. She has an end-on incisor relationship and a 5 mm shift to the left of the lower dental midline. She has a tendency a little bit towards a buccal crossbite on the right side and she has got a Class III end-on cuspid relationship. On the left side, she has a crossbite and closer to a Class I cuspid relatively. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal. Tonsils are mildly to moderately enlarged, particularly on the right side. The nasal septum is deviated significantly off towards the right side creating some airway obstruction there. Turbinate is moderate in size on the right side. The left side anterior of the turbinate appears more normal, but posteriorly it may be somewhat enlarged. The right nostril is quite narrow compared to the left, but this is mainly a result of the septum being deviated anteriorly off to the right side. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. She has some crunching noises in both joints, being a little bit louder in the right side than the left side. Maximum incisal opening is about 49 mm. Excursion movement to the right was about 6 mm and to the left about 2 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the mandibular third molars and impacted maxillary third molars. The maxillary first bicuspids and mandibular second bicuspids are absent. There are virtually no roots left on the maxillary lateral incisors and many of the other roots, particularly in the maxillary central incisors and lower incisors, bicuspids, and first molars, the roots are fairly short
Waters view shows that the bony septum at least is straight, although the cartilaginous septum is deviated off to the right side. The turbinates appear fairly enlarged particularly on the right side. The sinuses are quite small in size with increased thickness of the maxillary walls. Right TMJ tomogram shows degenerative changes within the joint and some flattening of the articular eminence. Left TMJ tomogram shows a significant degenerative changes and some decreased inclination of the articular eminence. On opening, there is moderately good translation. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B249 has an end-on incisor relationship but over angulation of the maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth. She has a moderately high occlusal plane angle and significant vertical maxillary deficiency in the alveolar bone particularly. Oropharyngeal airway looks good. The mandible and chin appear weak.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, left side worse than the right side. Vertical maxillary hypoplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia.
High occlusal plane angle. Mandibular dental midline and chin shifted 5 mm to the left of the facial midline. Left-sided posterior crossbite. Slight buccal crossbite tendency on the right side. End-on incisor relationship with the maxillary left incisor and mandibular left and right incisor. Missing maxillary first bicuspids and mandibular second bicuspids as well as the mandibular third molars.
Impacted maxillary third molars.
Severe root resorption on many of the teeth, particularly the maxillary lateral incisors where the roots are absent.
Class III cuspid relationship on the right side and close to Class I cuspid relationship on the left side.
Deviated nasal septum off to the right side.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Nasal airway obstruction.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Maintain current alignment of the maxillary arch. Maintain current alignment of the mandibular arch. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Bilateral coronoidotomies.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to down graft in a counterclockwise direction.
Bilateral partial anterior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.
Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to advance the chin.
Surgical removal of impacted maxillary third molars. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Placement of implants in the maxillary lateral incisor area.
Restorative dentistry to build up the crowns on the dental implants.

B249 MRI

Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has an unusual shape to it. It is almost bifid in appearance. The disc appears to be in position, but medially displaced. Lateral pole of the condyle is significantly lower than the medial pole. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa is present.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better morphology. There appears there may be some discal tissue present in the joint, but, if so, it is extremely thin and surrounded by a panus. This is similarly seen on the opposite joint as well.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone some significant degenerative changes. There is anterior beaking and some sclerosis towards the medial side and flattening of the anterior head in the medial and lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately inclined. The disc appears to be in reasonable position, but there does appear to be a reactive panus surrounding the disc. The disc actually appears to be in reasonably good position, although the posterior band is anterior and sitting perhaps in the middle of the condyle. There appears to be an extension posterior from the condyle toward the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle and to a lesser degree translation of the disc. On open views, the articular eminence appears much flatter in orientation than in some of the other views.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle has degenerative changes, but does not appear to be quite as progressive as the other side. Articular eminence is moderately shallow in some areas. The disc appears to be more degenerated on this side. The disc appears to be in position, but there may be a reactive pannus surrounding it. The disc appears more degenerated on this side than the opposite side, although the panus does not appear quite as thick. There is moderately good translation of the condyle and there is some translation of the disc.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis. Probable connective tissue/autoimmune disease.
