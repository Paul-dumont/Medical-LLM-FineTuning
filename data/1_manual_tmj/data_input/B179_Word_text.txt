B179
B179 is 18 years old. B179 was referred by Dr. XXXX and also by Dr. XXXX, her orthodontist. Primary concerns B179 has are:
Her jaws hurt.
Difficulties breathing through the nose.
Severe snoring.
Headaches.

B179 believes that her joint problems began she was about 15 to 16 years of age. She had previous orthodontics beginning at the age of 8. She wore head gear from the age of 8 to 12 and had full orthodontic appliances from 10 to 15 and had a tongue rake from the age of 9 to 11.

Current symptoms include the following: She gets headaches in the frontal and temporal area at about of level of 2 that seem to occur behind her eyes. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 1, jaw function, diet and disability at 0. She states that she is an obligate mouth breather and has extreme difficulties breathing through her nose. She gets frequent earaches, moderate tinnitus and occasional vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her elbows and her knees. She is aware of clenching sometimes during the day when she gets frustrated. She recently had her wisdom teeth removed 4 days ago. Although she has severe snoring, she is not aware of having any sleep apnea issues and has no daytime tiredness. She had her adenoids removed 11 years ago and her tonsils removed 8 years ago.

In frontal view, B179 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 5.5 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much aligned on the facial midline. She has about 12 mm of lip incompetency. She shows about 6 mm of her lower incisors with the lips relaxed. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is probably about 3 mm posterior to subnasale. She does have some nasal dorsal prominence. She has about a 90 degree nasolabial angle. She has a definite head postured forward neck position. The maxilla is a good 6, perhaps 8 mm AP deficient. The chin is about 18 to 20 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is short. Intraorally, it appears that she has had first bicuspids extracted in all 4 quadrants. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has about a 1 mm vertical over bite relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Intranasally, she has enlarged turbinates. She also has some constricture of the luminal valves bilaterally. Holding luminal valves open improved her abilities to breath through her nose. To palpation, she has no particular pain on the head and neck area, but I could not evaluate the masseter muscles adequately because she has discomfort in the nose from the recently removed third molars. Also, the incisal opening is only 29 mm, again likely related to removal of the third molars. excursion movements are only about 3 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the recent extraction of maxillary and mandibular third molars. The sinuses appear relatively clear. The turbinates appear quite large. It is difficult to evaluate the TMJs.

Coronal radiograph shows that the sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear fairly large and obstructive.
Axial view shows that the turbinates are quite large and long in length and appear to cause significant obstruction of the nasal airway. Sinuses appear clear.

Left TMJ coronal view shows that there is moderate condylar width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. There is decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint indicative of perhaps medial displacement of the disc.

Right condyle is slightly larger than the left condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space indicative of perhaps a medial displacement of the articular discs.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some slight anterior beaking present. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There is decreased vertical joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that some slight anterior beaking. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. This condyle appears to be postured forward slightly.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B179 has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology with significant retrusion of the maxilla and mandible. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 5 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B179 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia but anterior vertical hyperplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
AP microgenia.
High occlusal plane angle. Decreased oropharyngeal airway of 5 mm (normal AP dimension is 11 mm).
Hypertrophied nasal turbinates with nasal airway obstruction.
Significant lip incompetence of 12 mm.
Constricted luminal valves.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning with ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superiorly, posterior aspect inferiorly, and advance. c.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward in a counterclockwise direction. d.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to augment the chin. e.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. f.	Reconstruct bilateral nasal luminal valves.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion and retain.

B179 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. There is significantly decreased vertical joint space. It appears there may be discal tissue anterior and medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There is decreased vertical joint space. The disc appears to be anteriorly and medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some slight anterior beaking. There is decreased vertical joint space. It appears there may be discal tissue anteriorly displaced particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medial, there is some disc that appears to show up and may be in a little bit better position. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with a slight anterior beaking present. It appears there is discal tissue that is in position, although the intermediate zone is not easily identifiable. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc maybe anteriorly and medially displaced. Right TMJ in relatively normal position.
