B310 
B310 is 14 years old, referred by Dr. __. B310 has previously been treated for insufficient growth with growth hormone for four years and this began 5 years ago. She has had a good result from that. She is 4 feet 11 inches tall and weighs 111 pounds. She had a seizure apparently related to being febrile but this was before the age of four and she has had no seizure since then. She takes no medications. We think that B310's problem was probably present at birth of unknown etiology. She has two other siblings who also have genetic deformities with one having Down syndrome and the other with a condition similar to B310's. Apparently only one of the four children is normal. Her jaw relationship has gotten significantly worse in the past few years. B310 has no problem with earaches or vertigo but gets occasional tinnitus. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing. She gets headaches at about a level of 3 in the temple and posterior head area. She has no TMJ pain except for headaches and no other pain around the head and neck area. She rates her jaw function at 2, diet at 0, disability at 0. B310 had a rapid palatal expansion last year and orthodontic appliances applied in earlier this year. The palatal expander appliance was removed this year.

CLINICAL EVALUATION
Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 6 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty close to being on the facial midline although the roots of the teeth are shifted off towards the left side probably a couple of mm. Lower dental midline may be about 1 mm to the left. Chin is about 2 to 3 mm towards the right. Chin is retruded about 25 mm. Chin-neckline is very short although chin-neck angle is reasonably well defined. Upper lip appears to have fairly good AP balance. She has a little bit of a problem with a hump on the nasal dorsum. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has severe crowding with the cuspids blocked completely out of the arch. Transversely the mandible is extremely narrow. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a total buccal crossbite on the right side and almost a total buccal crossbite on the left side. She has an overjet of probably a good 8 to 10 mm. She is slightly a Class II on the right side in the cuspid area and probably 5 to 6 mm Class II on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 4 to 5 mm. She has a transverse cant in the occlusion with the right cuspid being at least 3 mm higher than the left cuspid. Maximal incisal opening is about 42 mm. Excursive movements are about 3 mm to the right and perhaps 5 mm to the left. Maximal protrusion is about 3 to 4 mm probably. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size. The septum appears relatively straight. There does not appear to be any significant nasal airway obstruction. Uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars appear normal. Cannot visualize the tonsils. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size and the septum appears reasonably straight. She is not aware of snoring but does have some mild daytime somnolence. She is not aware of any sleep apnea symptoms. She sleeps well at night.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
We are unable to get our full set of radiographs we normally get. Family requested that we minimize her x-rays so we only took a cephalogram today. We did have an i-CAT taken that did give me a good view of the joints.

B310 
PA-ceph shows that she has moderately enlarged turbinates being greater on the left side than the right side. The lateral aspect of the right ramus has more of a concave shape to it as compared to the opposite side.

Panorex, the most recent one and readable one was taken last year. It showed that the lower cuspids were blocked out but all the rest of her teeth were present including all 4 third molars. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Joints appeared severely deformed.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B310 has anterior vertical maxillary excess, AP mandibular deficiency and posterior maxillary deficiency. She has a high occlusal plane angle. However, the oropharyngeal airway actually looks quite good with an AP dimension from soft palate to the posteropharyngeal wall area of about 8 mm and from the base of the tongue to the posteropharyngeal wall of about 9 mm. Joints severely AP deficient moreso than the mandible is AP deficient. She does have an AP overjet of about 8 mm. B310 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.

BASIC DIAGNOSES
Bilateral TMJ severe deformation.
Severe AP mandibular deficiency. AP anterior vertical excess.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Slight maxillary protrusion. AP microgenia.
Anterior mandibular vertical excess.
Class II occlusion.
Severe crowding of lower anterior arch. Significantly deficient transverse mandibular arch. High occlusal plane angle. Impacted wisdom teeth. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 3 mm higher than the left side. Bilateral buccal crossbites.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
Hold lower orthodontic movements and do not initiate any lower arch mechanics.
MRI of left and right TMJ. Surgery stage 1.
Placement of distraction osteogenesis device.
Vertical midline interdental osteotomy.
Removal of 4 impacted third molars.
Extract maxillary second bicuspids.

B310 
Distraction osteogenesis of the mandible.
Wait 7 to 10 days after surgery.
Distract ½ mm per day until expansion reaches at least 8 to 10 mm. Hold distraction and expansion with a lingual splint for 4 to 6 months.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch closing the second bicuspid extraction space. Decide whether to extract lower first bicuspids or second bicuspids depending on dental alignment following distraction.
Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery stage 2 treatment options.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Bilateral coronoidectomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Multiple maxillary osteotomies.
Augmentation genioplasty with medpor.
Surgical option 2.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies (sagittal split versus inverted L osteotomies) to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move anterior aspect superiorly, posterior aspect inferiorly and correct transverse width.
Augmentation genioplasty with medpor.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation: 
Coronal view: The patient has a deviated nasal septum with the superior aspect of the septum being tipped off towards the right side. Turbinates are moderately enlarged with the right one being larger than the left and may cause some airway obstruction. Maxillary sinuses look relatively healthy. Left coronal view shows she has a decreased joint space but a fairly normal mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flatly. Right TMJ likewise, the condyle appears relatively normal in shape but there does appear to be decreased space but maybe not as quite significant at the opposite side. A little bit more lateral downward curvature of the rim of the fossa by maybe 2 mm. In some other areas there appears that there is significant decreased vertical joint space. Ramus on the right side tends to be more concave than the left side.

Axial view shows that the septum has some bends in it. Turbinates are moderately enlarged, particularly the right side is enlarged significantly.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has reasonable size but significantly decreased joint space. Condylar head and neck although stout but appears short vertically. Minimal articular eminence is present.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is very short in vertical stature and head and neck are extremely shorter, much shorter than the opposite side. Decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence is relatively flat.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears fairly broad anteroposteriorly. Significantly decreased joint space. Discal tissue is present. Articular eminence is extremely flat.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is smaller than the left side considerably. It sits a little bit more forward in the fossa. There is a decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence is fairly flat. Further assessment of the sagittal view shows that the oropharyngeal airway is quite large. The soft palate may actually be a little bit short anteroposteriorly. There is a possibility that she could have hypernasal speech. Chin is severely retruded.

Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Side 1 sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone condylar resorption. There does not appear to be any discal tissue present. What disc is remaining, it appears to be anterior to the condyle. There is some anterior beaking present. There is decreased vertical joint space. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. More medially, some discal tissue is seen, but is deformed and sitting beneath the articular eminence. It is quite short anteroposteriorly. On opening, there appears to be fairly good translation of the condyle. It appears that there could be some reduction of the articular disc on the side. Coronal view shows that she has moderately wide condyles bilaterally. The lateral rim of the fossa curve inferiorly about 2 mm. There appears to be discal tissue anterior and medial to the condyles. There is some fluid in the superior joint space bilaterally.

Side 2 shows a condyle that appears a little bit more degenerated than the opposite side. There is anterior beaking present. It appears that there has been loss of condylar volume. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence with significant degenerative changes associated with it. It is quite short anteroposteriorly and thickened. There is some fluid in the anterior joint space anterior to the disc.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis with articular disc displacements, but it appears that there is reduction on opening.
