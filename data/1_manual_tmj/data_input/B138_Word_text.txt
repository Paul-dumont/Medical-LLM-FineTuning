B138
B138 is 17 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. She is in with Dr. XXXX. B138 is in good health. He currently takes no medications. B138 states that he believes his problems began about the age of 16 of unknown etiology. He developed pain and clicking in his jaw joints. Also his bite began to shift some. Prior to that time, he had orthodontics from the age of 13 to 15 with a good bite relationship. Since the onset of his problems, he has had some treatment including steroid Dosepak that helped while he was taking it. He has had physical therapy without benefit and had an over-the-counter splint that provided no help either. He has taken Feldene and ibuprofen with no improvement. B138 rates his headaches at 0, TMJ pain at 8 during function, and his average daily pain is also at 8. He rates his jaw function at 3, diet at 1, disability at 3. He has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother him. He is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime. B138 does have some snoring, but apparently no daytime somnolence, sleep apnea, or sleep disorder. He is not sure if he is a mouth breather or not.

In frontal view, B138 has fairly good left-to-right symmetry. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 1.5 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, B138 has some slight AP maxillary deficiency of probably 3 to 4 mm. The chin is retruded about 15 to 18 mm. The chin neckline is short, although the chin neck angle is fairly well defined. Intraorally, B138 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. The teeth are nicely aligned and leveled. He has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, B138 has all of his teeth back through the second molars present. He has some small upper lateral incisors. He has an open bite of about 2 mm. He seems to hit prematurely on the right side and has an open bite all the way back to the second molar on the left side. He has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship and probably about 3 to 4 mm Class II. He has about a 3 to 4 mm overjet. He has a transverse cant in the lower arch with the lower teeth on the left side being about 2 mm lower than the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively healthy and normal except the fascial pillars are mild to moderately constricted. The septum may be deviated just a little bit off to the right side. The turbinates are probably moderate in size. To palpation, B138 has some moderate pain over the TMJs and milder pain over the masseters and minimal pain over the retromandibular area. Maximal opening is 42 mm and opening without pain or discomfort 28 mm. The excursion movements are 10 mm in each direction. Joints function relatively smoothly.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of 4 impacted third molars. Sinuses look relatively healthy. Condyles appear arthritic. Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear. Nasal septum appears reasonably straight, at least in the bony septal area. Right turbinate is moderately enlarged and the left one looks more normal.

Axial view shows that the septum is reasonably straight. The sinuses are clear. The right turbinate is significantly enlarged, although the left one is more normal.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows the presence of significant condylar resorption with loss of probably most of the head of the condyle. There is small anterior beaking present. There appears there may be some calcifications within the joint. The articular eminence is relatively shallow. There appears to be some erosions in the roof as well as in the articular eminence. The joint space actually looks reasonably good. There is a pseudocyst in the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show that there has been significant loss of condylar volume. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. There is a pseudocyst in the head of the condyle. There is almost decreased joint space in this joint compared to the opposite side. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination and is a little bit steeper than the opposite side.

Left TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle that has undergone severe condylar resorption with probably loss of at least two-thirds of the vertical height of the condyle. There is osteophytic kind involvement extending medial and lateral off the remaining the head. There is decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. In one area, it does look like there could be some bone deposition along the medial wall. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with just a slight downward curvature.

Right TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle that has lost probably two-thirds of its volume. In the midline, there is an increased joint space but at the lateral rim of the fossa there is significantly decreased joint space and almost bone-on-bone contact. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat on this side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that unfortunately B138 was postured forward a little bit and was not back in centric relation. He has AP deficiency of the mandible. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures about 8 mm and at the base of the tongue measures about 5.5 mm. The lower incisors appear over angulated.

He has a slight reverse curve of Spee in the lower arch and a slight accentuated curve of speech in the upper arch. Tooth size discrepancy shows a Bolton's difference of less than 1 mm. Basic diagnoses for B138 would be as follows:

Bilateral TMJ juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with significant condylar resorption and reactive pannus surrounding the discs and condyle. Maxillary AP and posterovertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia. AP microgenia. Class II end-on occlusion.
Anterior open bite of about 2 to 3 mm. Occluding only on the posterior right first and second molars with all other teeth out of occlusion in centric relation. Impacted third molars.
Hypertrophied right turbinate.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain. Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Removal of all four wisdom teeth at least 6 months prior to the surgery.
2. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisors roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Place a small step in the arch wire to align the four incisors at an elevated plane compared to the cuspids back to the first molars. Place a band on the second molar, but do not tie the second molar into the arch wire. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 1 mm of tooth structure and retract.
3. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints.
4. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to augment the chin. d.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). e.	Right partial inferior turbinectomy. f.	Surgical removal of third molars x4.
5. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B138 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is narrow mediolaterally and has lost a lot of vertical volume. The disc is in place, but there is a reactive pannus surrounding the disc. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost a lot of volume vertically and mediolaterally. The disc is in position, but surrounded by a reactive pannus. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost significant volume . There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is flat and appears to have erosion factors associated with it. The disc is actually in reasonable condition, but surrounded by a reactive pannus. The condyle is postured a little bit forward in the fossa. The T2's highlight some of the reactive pannus surrounding the disc. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyles.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost a lot of vertical volume and perhaps a little bit anteroposteriorly. The articular eminence has very good formation on this side. The articular disc is in fairly good position, but there is a reactive pannus surrounding the disc. There is significant fluid in the lower joint space. The condyle is sort of mushroomed out on the right side, being longer anteroposteriorly than normal. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyles.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ severe condylar resorption with the discs in position, but with a reactive pannus surrounding the discs. TMJ pathology compatible with connective tissue autoimmune process.
