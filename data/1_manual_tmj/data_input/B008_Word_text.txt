B008
B008 is 23 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX.
B008 woke up with headaches 1 year and 11 months ago. One year and 2 months ago, he developed some TMJ and jaw issues. The etiology of his problems is unknown. For treatment, he has had 3 splints beginning 1 year and 2 months ago with the third one being constructed 7 months ago. These helped his jaw pain a little bit, but did not have any positive effect on the headaches. He began orthodontics 6 months ago with Dr. XXXX. He has been to Mayo Clinic and also to X Headache Clinic. Neither of those centers have been able to help his situation. He currently takes amitriptyline 70 mg q.h.s. B008 has a continuous headache that he rates at an average of 5 that occurs in the bilateral temporal areas. He rates his TMJ pain at 1, average daily pain at 4, jaw function at 3, diet at 1, and disability at 5. He has no trouble with earaches, has continuous tinnitus, but no vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother him. He is aware of clenching at daytime, but not at night because he sleeps with his mouth open. He has severe snoring, mild daytime somnolence. Six months ago, he was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. He has a mild sleep disorder and breathes through his mouth most all of the time. He was tried on CPAP machine, but was unable to tolerate it.

In frontal view, B008 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 4 mm on the left, 3 mm on the right. The nasal tip and the maxillary dental midline and mandibular dental midline are pretty much on the facial midline. The chin may be deviated just a little bit off to the right side a couple of millimeters. He has a lip incompetence of almost 8 mm. In profile view, B008 has a retrusion of the maxilla of a good 6 mm and the chin is at least 15 mm AP deficient. Intraorally, B008has all of his teeth back through the second molars. The teeth appear to be fairly well aligned and leveled. He has good attached gingiva in the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has springs between the upper laterals and cuspids to open up space there. When occluding, B008occludes only on his left second molars and all other teeth are out of occlusion. He has an anterior open bite of 2 mm in centric relation. He is vertical close to being a Class I cuspid relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left cuspid being about 3 mm lower than the right cuspid, but in the lower arch, the left cuspid is only about 1 mm lower than the right cuspid. Intranasally, the turbinates are probably moderate in size, but the septum is deviated off towards the right side. The right turbinate is larger than normal and it appears it blocks off a good portion of the airway on that side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. There is space between the upper laterals and cuspids. The sinuses look relatively clear.

Left TMJ coronal view shows that he has enlarged turbinates. The bony septum actually looks fairly straight. Sinuses are clear.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The septum deviates a little bit off towards the left side back in towards the anterior aspect of the maxillary sinuses. The turbinates appear enlarged and it appear that they were probably offering some constricture of the airway. It appears in the tomograms that he may have been posturing his jaw forward some. There appears to be increased posterior joint space in both joints. The joints have some mild arthritic changes, but nothing to significant. Articular eminences are fairly steep in both joints.

Coronal views show that there is decreased lateral joint space in both joints, but the vertical joint space appears fairly reasonably. It is possible there could be some medial displacement of the articular discs.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has an end-on incisor relationship. Oropharyngeal airway dimension at the soft palate measures about 7 mm and at the base of the tongue about 6.5 mm. In the x-ray, Robert's lower jaw was postured forward slightly.

Basic diagnoses for B008 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocations. Maxillary AP and transverse hypoplasia but anterior vertical maxillary excess.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
AP microgenia.
Anterior open bite.
Occluding only on the mandibular left second molars and all other teeth are out of occlusion. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Hypertrophied nasal turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. Sleep apnea. Continuous headaches.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Bilateral TMJ MRIs.
2.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Continue to align and level maxillary arch. b.	Continue to align and level mandibular arch.
3.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it, expand it, and level the arch transversely as well as anteroposteriorly. d.	Augmentation genioplasty. e.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
