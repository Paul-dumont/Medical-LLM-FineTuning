B299 
B299 is 26 years old, referred by Dr. __. B299 has problems with TMJ disorder and also she has been told she has postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. She has had two TMJ surgeries one 5 years ago and 4 years ago.

B299 's TMJ problems began when she was about 15 to 16 years of age when she had some popping in the right joint. Etiology was unknown but possibly could be unilateral right ICR. She had orthodontic treatment prior to that at the age of 10 with a bionator and then from the age of 10 to 14 she had 4 orthodontics performed with extraction of 4 first bicuspids. Somewhere around the age of 20 to 21 the pain got much worse and she had loud popping in the joints. She was placed on splint therapy but this did not fix the problem. 5 years ago she underwent surgery for a right TMJ articular disc repositioning procedure. Her pain actually got worse after the surgery. 4 years ago she had a meniscectomy performed and an ear cartilage graft placed. She had no pain for about two to three years but in the past year she has began developing increased pain and headache problems.

She currently takes Zyrtec 100 mg p.r.n. and Tylenol for pain.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Jaw and muscle pain.
Significant bone loss in the right jaw joint.
Difficulty eating and chewing.
Bite has changed and is continuing to undergo changes.
Right side occludes first and it is difficult for her to get the left side together.

She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, gets occasional vertigo but no hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her wrists and hips with the right side being worse than the left side. She does have some allergies to animals, trees, grasses, weeds and dust. B299 prefers not to wear earrings but when she was younger she wore cheap earrings and had some problems with them. B299 has a history of clenching but she does not feel she does much of that now and only occasionally though it used to be a much bigger concern. She gets headaches in the frontal and temple area at about a level of 5. She gets TMJ pain on the right side at about a level of 7 and on the left side a level of 4. Average daily pain is about a 3. She rates her jaw function at 7, diet at 5, disability at 3.

In frontal view, B299 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. In the lower third face there is some asymmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the side. Chin is about 5 mm off to the right side. The right side of the cheek area is more fuller than the left side. The inferior border of the mandible on the right side is probably 8 to 10 mm back at the angle area higher than the left side. In profile view, B299 has some AP deficiency in the maxilla probably about 3 to 4 mm. Chin is retruded by probably about 10 mm. B299 

Chin-neckline is somewhat shorter and reasonably well defined. Intraorally, B299 is missing probably the lower second bicuspids and upper first bicuspids. She has basically a slight Class II cuspid relationship on the right side by probably a couple of mm and on the left side she is probably just slightly a Class II as well by 1 to 2 mm. In centric relation, she hits first on the right side with most of the teeth up through the cuspid area. On the left side, she has an open bite of probably about 1 to 2 mm. When she does occlude she hits prematurely on the right bicuspids first before the other teeth on the right side settle in. If she maximizes her bite, the left side comes closer together but I am not sure that the teeth actually touch. She has about a 1 to 2 mm vertical overbite relationship even in centric relation. In centric relation of the first tooth touching, she has a tendency towards a buccal crossbite on the left side. The right side of the maxilla is superiorly positioned about 2 mm compared to the left side. In the mandible, there is about a 5 mm vertical difference between the position of the right cuspid compared to the vertical position of the left cuspid. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the right TMJ and right temporalis area but no other significant tenderness. To palpation, she has an opening click in the left joint about 10 mm and closing click probably about 5 mm. The right joint seems to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is about 45 mm, opening without significant discomfort 30 mm. Excursive movement to the right 12 mm, left 8 mm. In excursive movement, she did have pain in the right TMJ area. Intranasally, B299 has fairly large turbinates. It does appear to block off the majority of the nasal cavity. She has a spur at the base of the septum on the right side. She probably has moderate nasal airway obstruction. Columella, nostrils and luminal valves all look relatively normal.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Also, she is missing what appears to be the mandibular second bicuspids and maxillary first bicuspids. The sinuses look clear. The left condyle appears relatively normal. The right condyle and a good portion of the neck on the right side are gone.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. She has a significantly deviated nasal septum with a large spur coming off the left side. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The vertical asymmetry and the maxilla and mandible are noted. The angle on the right side is probably 8 to 10 mm higher than it is on the left side. The lower teeth are noted to be eschewed with the crowns tipped towards the left and the apices towards the right.

Right TMJ lateral tomograms show that her condyle is functioning forward in the fossa. There is a mass of tissue in the fossa which by history may mean auricular cartilage. The condyle is postured forward almost beneath the articular eminence. Significantly increased joint space almost 10 mm and the condyle is also forward in the fossa by probably 3 to 4 mm. The condyle is almost eroded down to the neck of the condyle.

B299 
Left TMJ tomograms show that the condyle appears arthritic but obviously not as severe as the opposite side. There is some flattening in the posterior head and also the anterior head with some superior beaking of the condyle. There is also a little bit of anterior beaking but not too significant. Articular eminence is extremely steep almost at a 90-degree to the horizontal plane. Increased anterior joint space and decreased superior joint space indicative of an anteriorly displaced disc but with likely early reduction. There is decreased posterior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of particularly the left joint and the right joint shows some lack of translation.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B299 has a Class II skeletal relationship. She has about a 2 mm overbite relationship and a Class II end-on occlusion. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the soft palate is only about 3 mm and the base of the tongue is no more than 5 mm. She has a relatively high occlusal plane angle. Vertical differential in the level of the occlusal plane by probably about 5 mm in the molar area and 6 mm at the inferior border area. The maxilla appears slightly retruded. B299 has had ANA rheumatoid factor and sed rate and these were all within normal limits.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Right TMJ severe resorptive arthritis.
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction.
AP mandibular deficiency and severe asymmetry. AP maxillary deficiency and asymmetry.
Posterior vertical maxillary asymmetry. Class II end-on occlusion.
High occlusal plane angle.
Occludes only on the right teeth in centric relation.
Left lateral and posterior open bite of about 3 to 4 mm. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.
CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Left TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.

B299 
Left mandibular sagittal split osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla and down graft it posteriorly as well as level transversely. Fat graft to left TMJ (harvest from the abdomen.)
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B299  MRI Evaluation 
Age: 26-year-old female Date of Birth: 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has very good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There appears to be some decreased joint space at the lateral rim of the fossa that almost impinges on the condylar head itself. The discal tissue appears to be anteromedially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption. There appears to be a lot of inflammatory tissue in the joint. The condyle is essentially absent. There appears to be areas of cystic formation up in the joint. There is essentially no condyle. I cannot identify any discal tissue.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little sclerosis on the superior aspect. It looks like hockey stick particularly towards the medial side of the joint. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced moreso at the lateral aspect of the joint and in a little bit better position but still anteriorly postured. Articular eminence is fairly steep particularly towards the medial side of the joint. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc does reduce and has had good translation of both the condyle and the disc. The disc is thickened over normal.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorptive changes. A tremendous loss of condylar volume has occurred. There appears to be a lot of fluid and/or cystic formation within the joint space. Articular eminence is almost nonexistent but there is a very unusual architecture in the front of the joint. There is a little bit of posterior protuberance of bone that may be a remnant of the articular eminence. There appears to be some anterior beaking on the head of the condyle. Discal tissue essentially is unidentifiable. On opening, there is actually moderately good translation of the condyle. The condyle comes forward beneath the articular eminence. There is significant increased vertical joint space with the cystic appearing tissues in place. The condyle is approximately 1 cm below the fossa area although there is probably some magnification in these images.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated but with reduction. Right TMJ severe condylar resorption with multiple cystic formations within the fossa area and no identifiable disc tissue.

RECOMMENDATION: Right TMJ exploration, removal of cystic tissues and condyle with reconstruction with total joint prostheses. Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
