B475 
B475 is 36 years old and referred by Dr. XX. B475 is not sure when her jaw problems began, but believes that she began having at least noises in her joints in her 20s of unknown etiology. She did have orthodontics in high school for about 2 years. She was not put in retainers. She has noticed that her lower jaw has become more retruded since finishing college again in the early 20s. She rates her headaches at 0, TMJ pain at 0, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 2, diet at 0, and disability at 1. She takes no medications. She has no problems with earaches, get occasional tinnitus but no vertigo. She has hearing loss in the right ear. She has a long history of having ear problems into adulthood being a little bit greater in the right side than the left side. Her only joints that bother her are her finger joints which are getting a little bit larger. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She is aware of having mild snoring and daytime tiredness, but she is not aware of overt sleep apnea problems. She is not sure if she is a mouth breather or not.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B475 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is almost 3 mm off towards the right side. The chin is off to the right side about 2 or 3 mm as well. In profile view, the maxilla is AP deficient by probably about 8 mm. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by about 3-4 mm. Chin is AP deficient by probably 15-18 mm. Chin neckline is short and the chin neckline is not too well defined. Intraorally, B475 is missing the mandibular left first molar, but has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars present. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some crowding in the lower anterior arch and crowding in the upper anterior arch. She has almost a full Class II cuspid relationship on the right side but Class I on the left side. She has small upper lateral incisors. She has a division 2 malocclusion. She has an anterior deep bite of 4 mm. The mandibular right cuspid is about 2-3 mm posterior to the left cuspid. In the upper arch, the cuspids are fairly symmetric. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Her tongue is quite large compared to the size of the oral cavity and it makes it a little bit difficult to evaluate the oropharyngeal tissues. Intranasally, the septum is deviated a little bit off to the right side. Right turbinate appears to almost touch against the septum. The left turbinate is enlarged, but there appears to be some space on the left side because of the deviated septum. To palpation, she has some mild to moderate tenderness over the TMJs and some mild tenderness over the retromandibular area and right shoulder. On opening, there is an audible click in the right joint at about 30 mm and a closing click at 5 mm. The left joint functions relatively smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is 49 mm, opening without discomfort 28 mm. The excursion movements are 10 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of impacted maxillary third molars. The mandibular third molars are absent. She is missing also the mandibular right first molar. The mandibular dental midline is shifted to the right of the maxillary midline. The turbinates appear moderate in size. The bony septum appears reasonably straight. The sinuses appear reasonably clear.

Coronal view shows that the turbinates are moderately enlarged, but the septum appears reasonably straight. The sinuses appear clear.
Axial view shows that the sinuses appear clear. The septum appears relatively straight and the turbinates are moderate in size, although there is some airway passage present.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show that the condyle has a little flattening on the anterior head and flattening on the posterior head. The condyle is sitting posterior in the fossa. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There is an increased anterior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that appears perhaps a little bit more arthritic. There is a little additional curvature forward in the condylar head. A little bit of anterior beaking may be present. The condyle appears some narrow anteroposteriorly. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The joint space appears fairly symmetric, although a little bit thin vertically.

Left TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle that has reasonably good mediolateral width. The joint space appears a little bit decreased at the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal tomograms shows a condyle with reasonably good mediolateral width, although just slightly more narrow than the opposite side. Joint space is slightly decreased vertically. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B475  has a retruded maxilla and mandible. She has an increased occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway is significantly decreased with an AP dimension of about 2-2.5 mm at the soft palate level and 5 mm at the base of the tongue, a deficiency of almost 3 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B475 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction on the right side and questionable reduction on the left side. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Class I occlusion on the left side, Class II cuspid relationship on the right side, division 2 incisor relationship.
High occlusal plane angle.
Missing mandibular right first molar.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.75 mm.
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 2.5 mm (normal 11 mm).
TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain. Transposition of maxillary left cuspid, first cuspid and 180 degree rotation of the maxillary left second bicuspid.
Lower arch asymmetry with the mandibular right cuspid being about 3 mm posterior to left cuspid, while in the upper arch the right cuspid is 1 mm or 2 in front of the left cuspid (first bicuspid).
Anterior deep bite relationship.
Snoring.
Daytime somnolence.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	MRI of left and right TMJs.
2.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Extract mandibular left second bicuspid. b.	Align and level mandibular arch with retraction of the mandibular left cuspid 1 mm or 2 more than the right side. Try to open up some spacing in the mandibular right posterior quadrant to make the first molar space size equal to the size of a bicuspid with subsequent implant placement. An alternative would be to bring the second molar forward to close the space and consider an implant in the second molar space post orthognathic surgery and orthodontics. Slenderize the lower anteriors 2 mm to correct for the tooth size discrepancy versus opening additional space in the upper arch around the lateral incisors. c.	Align and level the maxillary arch. Open up 1 mm of space around the left lateral incisor to help correct for the significant tooth size discrepancy.
3.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction approximately 18 mm. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it in a counterclockwise rotation approximately 8 mm at the incisal edge.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5.	Restorative dentistry to build up the maxillary lateral incisors and eliminate the spacing in the mandibular right first molar area.

I feel this treatment plan will get B475 the best treatment outcome. Our biggest concern is managing the orthodontic setup. The lower anteriors are crowded, slightly over protrusive, and the right cuspid is about 3 mm posterior to the left cuspid. Consideration would be to extract the mandibular left second bicuspid and close that space. On the right side, it would almost be advantageous to open that space enough to place an implant and crown the size of a bicuspid. If you feel it would work out better to advance the molar forward, then an implant could be placed posterior to the molar to provide a dental unit to support the maxillary second molar. In the upper arch, she has small laterals particularly on the left side, so opening space around that tooth of at least 1 mm would be helpful to help correct for the tooth size problem and also aesthetically make the tooth a more normal size. There is almost a 3 mm tooth size discrepancy, so slenderizing the lower anterior teeth would help adjust for that problem. Another option would be to basically treat her non-extraction and place TADS in the posterior mandible to retract the entire dental arch particularly on that left side. This way it would maintain a full dentition.

DATE OF INTERPRETATION: 
Right TMJ sagittal view condyle appears arthritic with sclerosis on the head of the condyle and anterior beaking. The condyle is somewhat posteriorly positioned in the fossa. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is some compressed tissue adjacent to the condyle and the disc. The disc appears to be significantly laterally displaced. There is a lot of fluid in the superior joint space. More medially, not much discal tissue is seen. On opening, there is reduction of the disc and fairly good translation of both the condyle and the disc. The disc appears to have a better shape in the open view with the posterior band being fairly thick.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis on the top of the condyle and perhaps a small osteophytic kind of formation off the top of the condyle. The anterior slope of condyle is flattened. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The disc is anteriorly displaced more so at the lateral aspect of the joint. There appears to be fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. There is fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation with reduction of the articular disc.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has moderately good transverse width with a little bit of sclerosis on the top of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears to be anteromedially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width with some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The disc appears to be anteriorly and laterally displaced.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteromedially displaced but with reduction on opening.
Right TMJ arthritis (greater than the left side) and articular disc anterolaterally displaced but with reduction on opening.
Articular discs appear to be salvageable.
