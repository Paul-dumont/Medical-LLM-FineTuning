B278
B278 is 19 years old and referred by Dr. ___.
Patient History
She has had previous biopsy of a lymph node behind her ear. She does have mold allergy. B278 is in good health with no major medical problems. She takes Yasmin and Glucophage for polycystic ovaries. B278 has had orthodontics twice before and now has her orthodontic appliances on for the third time and just got these on this year. B278 has had orthodontics x 3. The first time was from 8 to 10 years ago. The second time was 6 to 7 ago. She then went about five years without too much of a change and then her bite started to change again, and her bite started to open more. That is when she went to her dad and said she was ready to proceed on, and then she got braces few months ago. She has seen Dr. __  for surgery.

Patient Concerns
Jaws and teeth don't fit together properly
Difficult to get her teeth together
Predominantly a mouth breather
Possible difficulties breathing through the nose particularly at night when she sleeps
Some pain and discomfort through the jaws

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B278 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is almost 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3.5 to 4 mm. Nasal tip is just slightly off to the right side probably 1 to 2 mm. Maxillary dental midline appears to be pretty much on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline and chin.

In profile, B278 has a slight obtuse nasolabial angle. Upper lip supralabrale is probably about 3 to 4 mm anterior to subnasale. She has lip incompetence of about 9 mm. Lower lip is somewhat everted compared to the AP position. The chin-neckline is short, although the chin-neck angle is well-defined. Chin appears to be AP deficiency by probably 10 to 12 mm. Labiomental fold is fairly prominent in part due to the eversion of the lower lip.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Teeth are well aligned and levels. She has really good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. There is an accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch. She has a Class II end-on cuspid-molar relationship of probably about 3 to 4 mm. She has an anterior open bite of at least 3 mm. Left cuspid is probably a millimeter lower than the right cuspid. She has had her wisdom teeth removed. When occluding, she hits only on her second molars on the right side. She cannot feel the second molars or any of the other teeth touch from the right first molar all the way around to the left second molar. Oropharynx appears clear, and she has a little red spot on her soft palate just to the right of the midline. It measures about 2 mm across. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum may be deviated a little bit off toward the left side. Seems to have moderate airway constricture. Nostrils are a little bit narrow. Holding her nostrils open, she could breathe easier through her nose. Luminal valves could be a little bit constricted as well. She gets tired during the day but could be related just to college life.

Maximal incisal opening is 55 mm. Excursive movements to the right are 9 mm and to the left 100. Joints seem to function fairly smoothly although there were some rough areas in the joints. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseter muscles, TMJs, and high moderate pain over the styloid areas. She had a T&A done when she was in the fourth grade.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows that the sinuses look reasonably clear. Difficult to evaluate the nasal airway as it appears that there is some deviation in the septum, and the left airway looks fairly well blocked. Missing all four third molars. Appears to be adequate space between the lateral incisors and the cuspids, although there is a laceration of the maxillary left lateral incisor where it curves back toward the cuspid. It appears that there is enough room to get through there. Condyles appear a little bit abnormal but difficult to tell on those views.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Nasal airway appears to be fairly well blocked. A little outward curvature of the angle of the mandible on the right side compared to the left side. This may be due to the fact that she has better tooth contact on the right side than the left side.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be postured forward in the fossa somewhat, and she is in more of a Class I molar relationship than her centric relation would indicate. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Posterior joint space is increased, but I am sure in centric relationship it is going to be decreased. The space between the condyle and the articular eminence appears decreased and less than normal. This could be indicative of possible medial displacement of the articular disc.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has just a touch of anterior beaking present perhaps. Joint space is a little bit decreased posteriorly and superiorly.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyles bilaterally.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship with a significant anterior open bite. Appears to have vertical maxillary excess but AP mandibular deficiency. There is a vertical difference between the inferior border of the mandible with one side being about 5 mm vertically higher than the opposite side. Oropharyngeal airway looks very good.

B278 has a tooth-size discrepancy. The spacing created in the upper arch between the lateral incisors and cuspids seems to compensate for the tooth-size discrepancy. However, the lower incisors are overangulated, and it would be of advantage to slenderize the lower anterior teeth and retract them some.

Basic Diagnoses
Vertical maxillary excess
AP mandibular deficiency
AP microgenia
Class II end-on occlusion
Anterior open bite
High occlusal plane angle
Accentuated curve of occlusion, upper arch
Overangulation of lower incisors
Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm
Rule out bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocations
Hypertrophied turbinates
Nasal airway obstruction
Myofascial pain
TMJ pain

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Continue to align and level maxillary arch. If possible, tip maxillary lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally particularly on the left side to help create more space
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth-size discrepancy and to decrease angulation of the lower incisors

Surgery
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly, correct the accentuated curve of Spee, and level the anteroposterior occlusal plane
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Augmentation genioplasty
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion

Date of Reading: 

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width and possibly some slight loss of vertical dimension but difficult to tell. Downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of only 1 to 2 mm. Mandibular condyle lateral pole extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Difficult to tell where the discal tissue is, but it may be anteriorly positioned. Vertical joint space appears reasonably good.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral pole of the condyle extends slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa but not quite as far as the opposite side. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of probably 2 mm. Joint space appears to be relatively normal. However, it is difficult to identify the articular disc.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is flattened on the posterior head particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint but has a better morphology toward the medial side. Slight anterior beaking present more toward the medial side. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced particularly out toward the lateral aspect of the joint, but toward the medial aspect it appears to be in better position. Joint space looks good throughout, although at the lateral aspect there appears to be decreased posterior joint space. The disc is sitting in a vertical position along the posterior border of the articular eminence. A little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space but not too significant.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the articular disc with reduction on opening.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the posterior head but not quite as much as the opposite side. More medially it has a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. A little sclerosis on the anterior head. A little bit of anterior beaking more pronounced toward the medial aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is fairly steep similar to the opposite side. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced but the lateral aspect of the joint assumes a vertical position directly behind the articular eminence. Toward the medial side, the disc may be in better AP position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space but not much.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the articular disc. The disc appears to be well-reduced in the opening views.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint but with reduction
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated at the lateral aspect of the joint but reduces
