B017
B017 is 28 years old. He had orthodontics done when he was a teenager. He went back into orthodontics six years ago. Five years and five months ago, he had double jaw surgery by XXXX . There were some problems that occurred right after surgery with the proximal segment on the right side rotating upwards and forwards in the mandible. Nothing was done about this at the time. The treatment was completed. B017 was not happy with the result. He went back into orthodontic treatment with XXXX. Five months ago, upper jaw surgery was repeated, this time by XXXX. B017 is unhappy with the result.

After the first surgery, he also began having TMJ symptoms including some clicking and popping. The treatment was eventually completed and three years ago B017 began orthodontic treatment again. Five months ago, is when he had the upper jaw surgery performed by XXXX.

B017 gets headaches at about a level of 8 in the right frontal area and the posterior head area. He rates his TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at 8, jaw function and diet at 3, disability at 7. He gets occasional earaches on the right side. He gets tinnitus and occasionally gets some vertigo. He is aware of clenching during the day, but does not believe he does it at time.

Primary concerns that B017 has at this time include the following:
Vertical asymmetry between the left and right sides back at the angle areas. Notch on the right side of the inferior border of the mandible. Joint issues including clicking and popping. TMJ pain and headaches. Difficulties eating and chewing. Asymmetry of the lips with a corner on the right side being displaced more laterally than the corner of the mouth on the left side.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B017 has fairly reasonable left-to-right facial symmetry relative to transverse dimension. There is a very prominent notch in the left side of the mandibular body area in the area of the original mandibular osteotomy. The left side has a notch too, but not nearly as significant as the right side. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 1 mm. The maxillary and mandibular dental midline are pretty much aligned with each other. Chin appears to be off towards the right side just about 2 or 3 mm. B017 states that he has lost about 25 to 27 pounds since the first surgery because he does not feel like eating. In profile view, B017 has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. He has some AP deficiency in chin projection 6 to 8 mm. The chin neckline is short, although the chin neck angle is well defined. He has some asymmetry in his upper lip where the right commissure extends farther laterally than the left side does. The right commissure is probably 3 mm wider from the midline of the upper lip compared to the left side. Intraorally, B017 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars present. He has significant space between the mandibular first molar and second bicuspid. They appear to be a little bit lingually inclined. He appears to have adequate attached gingiva in the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars present. He has a slight increased curve of Wilson. He is basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship with posterior crossbite tendency. He has about a 1 to 1.5 mm overbite. B017 has had the maxillary third molars and mandibular right molar removed. In the mandibular left arch, the first molar at some time in the past was extracted and the second and third molar brought forward, although there is still residual space between his bicuspid and the second molar. The occlusal surfaces of the posterior teeth are quite flat. Oropharyngeal tissues look reasonably healthy and normal. Intranasally, the septum is deviated just ever so slightly to the left side. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size, and there appears to be good nasal airway. B017 gives no history of snoring, daytime somnolence, nor sleep apnea. He is predominantly a mouth breather when he sleeps. B017 usually feels better in the mornings when he wakes and then discomfort and aches and pains tend to develop in the afternoon. As B017 postures his mandible towards the left side about 2 mm, it improves his overall facial symmetry, particularly in reference to the mandible. The chin midline and lower dental midline are fairly well aligned with each other if the slight cant in the occlusal plane is taken in to consideration. To palpation, he has some moderate discomfort over the SCM on the right side, posterior neck on the right side as well as the right retromandibular area. He had no pain to palpation over the TMJ joint. Maximum opening is about 44 mm, opening without discomfort 35 mm. Excursion movement to the right 5 mm, to the left 6 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of four bone plates in the maxilla. He is missing the maxillary third molars, mandibular right third molar, mandibular left first molar with the second and third molar drifted partially forward into the joint space. A significant notch is present on the right side of the mandibular body creating about 6-7 mm vertical deficit. The left side appears in better condition. Coronal view shows just the sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged particularly towards the posterior aspect of the sinus. The septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. Axial view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good size to it. Fossa appears a little bit tight. There is some decrease posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint, the joint seems to fill almost all of the bony fossa indicative of probably medially displaced disc.
Right TMJ shows a condyle that has slightly posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is good vertical joint space. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint, the space is absent. At the lateral aspect of the extremely narrow joint space, it is possible that the disc could be medially displaced. Left TMJ coronal view shows a very oddly shaped condyle. At the medial aspect, the condyle has a decreased vertical joint space. It is almost heart shaped and rotated towards one side. There is decreased superior joint space. There appears to be some heterotopic bone laid out in the fossa area. There is truly a notch shaped condyle on this side. There could be some areas where there is decreased joint space.
Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is a little space in the upper joint space. There is decreased space at the lateral rim of the fossa. The condyle looks healthier on this side than the opposite side. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has got basically a skeletal Class I occlusion and Class I jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks good.

Basic diagnoses for B017 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and medial displacement of the articular discs with significant deformation of one condyle. Maxillary asymmetry with it being shorter vertically on the right side by 1.5 to 2 mm with a yaw to the right of approximately 1 to 2 mm as well as transverse hypoplasia.
Mandibular asymmetry with it vertically higher on the right side by 1.5 to 2 mm with the right side being 1.5 to 2 mm higher than the left side and with a yaw off towards the right side of 1 to 2 mm. Bilateral posterior crossbite tendency. Large bony defect in the inferior border on the right side of the mandible.
Anterior mandibular vertical hyperplasia.
Anterior mandibular AP microgenia.
TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Missing mandibular left first molar with the second and third molar drifted forward into the first and second molar position, but with some residual spacing between the molar and second bicuspid.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors and probable arthroplasties.
Maxillary osteotomies to transversely level the maxilla, expanding it, and correcting the posterior yaw by rotating it towards the left 1 to 2 mm. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to shift the mandible to the left posteriorly 1 to 2 mm and leveling it transversely. Synthetic bone graft to the inferior border of the mandible on the right side to fill the bony defect. Anterior mandibular horizontal ostectomy to vertically reduce and anteriorly augment the chin. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

I feel this treatment plan would get B017 the best possible treatment outcome.
B017 MRI Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic. It appears that the disc is in pretty good position, at least over medially. Towards the lateral aspect, the disc becomes a little bit more difficult to see. There appears to be decreased posterior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little flattening on the condylar head. The disc appears to be in reasonable position, but could be just slightly forward. There appears to be decreased posterior joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears to be medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 mm or so.

Right TMJ coronal view likewise shows a condyle with good mediolateral width and in fact the condyle appears almost excessively large. There is significantly decreased lateral joint space, but the disc appears to be on top of the condyle, but medially displaced.

T2 film left TMJ shows that the disc does appear to be in position anteroposteriorly in the middle and medial aspect of the joint. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, the disc appears to be in a reduced position. However, there appears to be some restriction in translation.

Right TMJ T2 shows that the disc appears to be in position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, the disc appears to be in good position. There seems to be some restriction in translation.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc medially displaced.
