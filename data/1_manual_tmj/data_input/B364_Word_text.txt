B364 
B364 is 30 years old. He was referred by Dr. __. B364's primary concerns are as follows:

Sleep apnea.
Popping in the right TMJ. Discomfort in the right jaw area.
B364 takes the following medications:
Propecia.
Asmanex inhaler which he began just a couple of months ago.

B364 was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma 5 years ago. He has had previous surgery for pectus excavatum 20 years ago. He had some foot surgery 13 years ago. He had a lump removed from his left neck in 5 years ago which is when the diagnosis for the Hodgkin's lymphoma was identified.

B364 has no problems with headaches, but gets TMJ pain at about a level of 2, but on the average day does not have any significant pain. He rates his jaw function, diet, and disability all at 0. He has a little bit of numbness in the left submandibular area where the neck mass was removed 5 years ago.

B364's TMJ problems began as best he can remember about age of 20 when he noted clicking and popping in his right joint. The etiology is unknown. He has had not treatment to date for it. B364 has severe snoring. He has probably some daytime somnolence. Sleep apnea is probably at a moderate level, although he does have 70 breathing interruptions per hour. He has probably a moderate sleep disorder, and he is a predominant mouth breather particularly at night. B364 does have a CPAP machine, but does not notice any significant improvement in his situation with using it or not using it.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B364 has fairly good symmetry in the lower and upper third face with maybe some slight asymmetry in the lower third face. There is a little bit of increased fullness in the left side of the face by probably 3 to 4 mm. Upper lip length is 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is zero. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is just slightly to the left side about 1 or 2 mm. The mandibular dental midline is shifted about almost 2 mm to the left, but the chin is fairly well aligned with the facial midline. In profile view, B364 may have about 3 mm of AP deficiency in the maxilla. The chin may be 10 to 12 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline and angle are not well defined. Intraorally, B364 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars present. The lower incisors are tipped towards the left side at the incisal tip. The left cuspid is 1 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. B364 has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship on the right side and Class II end-on relationship on the left side by probably about 3 mm. B364 has an anterior deep bite of about 4 mm. B364 does have some transverse constricture of both maxillary and mandibular arches. This may contribute to displacement of his tongue posteriorly. He seems to have adequate attached gingiva, although there is a little retraction of the gingiva around the incisors, particularly the 2 centrals and the left and lateral as well as the left cuspid. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Uvula is slightly elongated. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size. The septum however is deviated significantly off towards the left side anteriorly. Posteriorly, it may be a little bit off towards the right side, but difficult to tell. To palpation, B364 has no tenderness around the head and neck area. He appears to have clicking and popping in both joints with the right one significantly louder and more predominant compared to the left side. On the right side, the clicks occur at about 20 mm of opening and about 10 mm of closing, whereas on the left side, a softer click occurred at about 15 mm of opening and about 5 mm of closing. Maximal incisal opening is 57 mm. Excursion movements to each side is 11 mm. B364 appears to have some mild masseteric hyperplasia bilaterally, but it seems fairly even on both sides.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the four third molars, but all the rest of the teeth are present. There is a root canal in the maxillary right second molar. B364 has relatively prominent gonial notches, being more prominent on the left side than the right side which would go along with the maybe slight increase buildup of the masseter muscle on the left side compared to the right side. Sinuses look relatively clear. Waters view shows that the right side of the nose looks fairly open, but the left side appears pretty much obliterated in part due to deviation of the septum as well as the turbinate appears quite large posteriorly. Sinuses look relatively clear.
Right TMJ tomogram shows that there appears to be decrease posterior and superior joint space, although the condyle appears to have reasonably good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that likewise appears to be a little bit superior and posterior positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B364 has a moderately high occlusal plane angle and retrusion of the maxilla and mandible. The oropharyngeal airway measures about 5 mm at the soft palate level and about 5 mm at the base of the tongue. Soft palate appears a little bit elongated.

Basic diagnoses for B364 would be as follows:
Sleep apnea syndrome. Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reduction.
AP maxillary hypoplasia. Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia. Class II end-on occlusion on the left side, Class I occlusion on the right side.
Transverse narrowness of both the maxillary and mandibular dental arches. Moderate crowding of lower anterior arch. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1.5 mm. Deviated nasal septum. Hypertrophied left turbinate.
Nasal airway obstruction. Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 5 mm (normal AP dimension 11 mm).

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
MRI of left and right TMJ. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 1.5 mm of tooth structure.
Try to expand the mandibular arch orthodontically by up righting the teeth over distal bone. Hopefully, we can gain about 4 mm of transverse width in the arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction by down grafting it posteriorly as well as expand the arch transversely. Nasal septoplasty.
Left turbinectomy.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

AGE: 30/M

Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of an odd shape to it and appears to be lacking the lateral pole of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There is almost an exophytic bump on the lateral aspect of the condyle, but down where the lateral pole should be. The condyle is confined to the inner portion of the fossa. It appears that there is discal tissue anterior to the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle appears larger and appears to have more of a lateral pole. Lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There appears to be discal tissue anterior the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. A little flattening on the anterior head and some slight anterior beaking present, but not too significant. The disc is anteriorly displaced, but towards the medial side the disc is in better position. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc reduces and there is good translation of the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. A little medial, it is in a better position. Posterior joint space is somewhat decreased. There is fluid in the superior joint space anteriorly beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there reduction of the disc and good translation of the condyle and the disc.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction. Right TMJ anteriorly displaced articular disc with early reduction. Both joints demonstrate a rotational displacement with the discs displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint, but over medially are in better position. Indicated treatment would be bilateral TMJ disc repositioning with Mitek anchors.
