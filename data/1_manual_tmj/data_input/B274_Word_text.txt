B274 
B274 is 69 years old. Referred by __. She was also referred by Dr. ___. She has also been to see Dr. __ who did some splint therapy. She has dentures and also wears splints. Primary concerns that B274 has include the following:
Jaw aches and pains.
Headaches. Earaches.

She would like to have relief of pain and be able to return to a normal life and have dentures that work properly for her. Additional problems that she has includes arthritis and depression. Previous surgeries include a partial hysterectomy 44 years ago, bladder surgery 18 years ago, and then some type of surgery to release adhesions 30 years ago. B274 Jean does have a problem of her blood pressure dropping out and apparently can pass out. B274 takes the following medications:

Cymbalta 60 mg q.d.
Actonel 30 mg weekly.
Nexium 40 mg per day.
Senna Soft Gels 2 or more daily as needed.
Refresh Celluvisc.
Calcium.
Alprazolam 0.5 mg per day. She only took 3 of those and has not taken any in the last couple of weeks.
Myochrysine 50 units every 4 weeks.
Fish oil 1000 mg 2 to 3 per day.

She has a number of medications that she is allergic to and we have that listed in her chart.
To B274's best knowledge, her TMJ problems began when she was about 64 years old when she had her teeth extracted 5 years ago. B274 gets headaches predominantly on the left side and, for the last 2 to 3 weeks, they have reached to a level of 10. Today her headache is at a level of 1. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, her facial pain and headaches together at about a level of 10 within the last 2 to 3 weeks. Today her pain levels are about 2. Jaw function is at 3, diet at 4. She has been at a level of 8 recently, but today her disability is probably closer to 1 or 2. She gets earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her hips and her back. She was at one time diagnosed as having rheumatoid arthritis, but her rheumatologist, Dr. __ , apparently is backing off that diagnosis currently. Today, however, B274 had a Cymbalta and also two Valiums which may improve her overall levels today. She took the Valium to aid her in going through the MRI.

CLINICAL EVALUATION. She has good facial balance to the left and right direction and good vertical balance. She has dentures in right now and she has a 3-mm thick splint it. In profile, she has fairly vertical and AP facial balance. Intraorally, she has upper and lower full dentures and she has a lower splint. Oropharyngeal airway tissues look relatively normal. She has some mild snoring, but no daytime somnolence and no sleep apnea symptoms. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseter muscle and high moderate pain over the TMJs. The styloid area has milder tenderness. She is unaware of clenching her teeth.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows that B274 is totally edentulous. There are some arthritic changes probably in her joints. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There appears to be some decreased vertical and articular anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There seems to be increased anterior joint space. On opening, there is some restricted translation bilaterally. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has basically a skeletal Class I jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway appears reasonable with about 8-9 mm airway space at the soft palate level and about 7-8 mm airway space at the base of tongue. However, she is holding her tongue down in her mouth when this x-ray was taken. Basic diagnoses for B274 are as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain.
Earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo.
Totally edentulous.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Reconstruction of dentures.

With this approach of placing the discs back in position, it would shift the mandible out of position. B274 will need reconstruction of her dentures post-surgery. They understand this. I believe that this procedure will give her the best chance of getting rid of her headaches, TMJ pain, myofascial pain, and ear symptoms, although they understand there is no guarantee that this will eliminate these problems. She has been under treatment with Dr. __ for some time now without significant improvement. She has tried conservative treatment unsuccessfully.

B274  MRI EVALUATION 
AGE: DOB:
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal views shows a condyle that a little sclerosis on the top. Joint space could be a little bit compressed. The disc may be anteromedially displaced. The lateral rim curves inferiorly 1 mm or so.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width and some sclerosis on top. The disc appears to be medially displaced. There is decreased lateral joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. Some flattening on the superior head and perhaps a small erosion in this area. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and in a vertical orientation. There is decreased posterior joint space. The disc may be acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posteriorly. There is a little bit of fluid in the inferior joint space. Unfortunately, there are no open views so difficult to tell if there is reduction of the disc on opening.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit sclerotic on top. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc appears anteriorly displaced, but appears to be an early reduction on opening. There is decreased posterior joint space and superior joint space. Disc appears somewhat thickened.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated, but appears that there would be early reduction in both joints.
B274 

The patient presents for final presurgical workup. Final records were taken at her last appointment here. History and physical performed today. Consent form reviewed and signed. I did my final examination. I answered all the questions she and her husband had. B274 states that she has drainage from her ears and odor from her ears. Examination shows that her ears are very clear with no evidence of infection or other problems. No drainage is seen. Tympanic membranes appear clear, although a little bit sclerotic on the right side. I did not notice any odor emitting from her ears. She is ready for surgery tomorrow.

B274 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. She looks good. She has a smile on her face. Her severe headaches are not present any more. She is feeling much more comfortable. A little bit of tenderness and soreness in the temple areas. Today I removed her sutures. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She says she has felt the best that she has in the past 5 years. She is doing very well and return to see me in 3 months.

B274 
Telephone conversation with her. She is doing fairly well. She has some tenderness in her joints as expected and makes noises particularly when she yawns. I told her that that is fairly normal and that she should not be overly concerned about that at this time. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

B274 
The patient presents for a followup evaluation. She is now a little bit over 3 months postsurgery. She had done fairly good. Her headaches have dropped down to a level of 5 on that left side. She only gets occasional pain in the jaw joints. She has some minor complaints, but nothing real significant. To palpation, she has some moderate tenderness in one spot over the left temporalis muscle, but relatively minimal tenderness over the left masseter and bilateral TMJs. She gets occasional left-sided earaches and still gets some tinnitus, but no vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her hips, back, elbows, and wrists. She takes the following medications:

Cymbalta 60 mg q.d.
Actonel 30 mg weekly.
Nexium 40 mg q.d.
Gold shots periodically.
Fish oil.
Her occlusion looks good. We took some x-rays today and joint spaces look well balanced bilaterally. She appears to be progressing well, is in good spirits, and is very thankful for the improvement she has had so far. She is to return to see me in 3 months.

B274 
Telephone conversation with Dr. __ . She has cataracts and he wants to do surgery on her and she is allergic to lidocaine. He wanted to know if she could be intubated. Her surgery was about 5 to 6 months ago. I told him as long as the anesthesiologists were gentle with her jaws and jaw joints that I do not see a problem with that. She is edentulous and it appears that she should be a relatively easy intubation. They will try to do with her a laryngeal mask kind of technique so that they do not actually have to intubate her, but if they do need to intubate I told him I felt it be fine as long as they were reasonably gentle with her.

B274 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient is significantly improved, but still having some problems, predominantly on the left side. She gets some pain in the left temporal area just above the arch and just above the joint area. This is about a level of 6. She apparently does not have any pain directly in the joint itself. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the masseter muscle, but not directly over the joints. She has some tenderness over the left shoulder. She takes the following medications:

Cymbalta 60 mg q.d.
Actonel 30 mg each week.
Nexium 40 mg q.d.
Gold shots.
Her arthritis in her joints is apparently doing better, and she is not having much joint problems except I believe for her right little finger that she fell and broke. It is a little bit tender for her. Her incisal opening is 30 mm. She feels as though her ear canal closes on the left side, and it may be due to the fact that the disc is back in position and she still has some inflammation that causes some swelling in the area. She has tried some medications with Dr. __ that did not agree with her. Will try to get those records from Dr. __ . There are some medicines she cannot take. She can take Excedrin. I suggested she take Excedrin two times a day to see if this will help settle the inflammation and help her feel better. She also has some problems with her vertical dimension, and she over closes currently and this may contribute some to her muscle tenderness. Overall, she is improved. She is only 6 months postsurgery and still in the healing process. She is to call me in 2 weeks to let me know how she is doing.

B274
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. Her occlusion is good. Incisal opening is about 35 mm with a little bit of help. Her occlusion looks stable. She has some different symptoms and feels that her back teeth are not as far apart as they should be when she opens, but to me it looks like things function fairly well. She has about 3 mm of excursion movement in each direction. To palpation, she has no pain over the joints and just very minimal tenderness over the temporalis, particularly on the left side, and the left medial pterygoid area. For the most part, she seems to be progressing well, although psychologically she appears to be improving more slowly. She does get some headaches in the left temporal area. Otherwise, she seems to be progressing well. We will try to set her up with the CMP clinic to see if they can make dentures for her at the dental school. She is to return to see me in about 3 to 4 months for a year followup.

B274 
B274 presents for followup evaluation. She is now about 14 months post bilateral TMJ articular discs repositioning with Mitek anchors. She continues to have some problems. She gets some pain predominantly in the left TMJ area and ear area. Incisal opening is 33 mm. I forgot to measure her side-to-side movement. She gets headaches on the left side in the frontal and temporal area at about a level of 3. She gets some TMJ pain at about a level of 3 and average daily pain at 5. She rates her jaw function at 0, diet at 4, disability at 3. She actually has fairly good side-to-side movement, but I forgot to measure it. To palpation, she has rather severe pain over the temporalis muscles, but relatively minimal to mild tenderness over the rest of the head and neck areas. She has no earaches, but gets tinnitus, left side worse than the right side, and she gets some vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She does get some sharp pains into her ears particularly on the left side, but not earaches per se.

The last time she was here I had suggested that she go to the CFP Clinic to have her dentures constructed. This was done, but she found the dentures uncomfortable. She went back to her original dentist who made her a new set of dentures. These fit together pretty well and are more comfortable than the previous set, but she feels as though her tongue is squashed down and flattened and there is no room for her tongue. She also gets some tissue trapped between the dentures of the left side which is basically cheek tissue which she feels has fallen down and gets between her dentures. She feels that her back teeth may be down too far. I explained to her that the resorption of the alveolar ridges, particularly in the upper arch, is what has caused the palate to be so flat as the vertical height of the alveolar ridges decreases, the palate will relatively seem flatter. I am not sure how to remedy this situation for her except to have the upper denture remade bringing it down further vertically and trying to thin the palate on the denture as much as possible. A second alternative would be to do sinus lifts with bone grafting and placement of osteointegrated implants so that the upper denture could be made to palatal coverage.

Radiographically, with the tomograms, she has good joint spaces in the coronal and sagittal views indicative of the discs being in proper position.
When she bites her teeth together, she tends to get dystonic jaw movements. I suggested that she take magnesium 3 tablets in the morning and 3 tablets in the evening to see if this will help quiet this down. An additional alternative may be to try perhaps Klonopin 0.5 mg once or twice during the day to see if this would help quiet the muscles down. At this time, we will just start with the magnesium. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

B274 
She presents for further evaluation. I earlier talked to Dr. __  in reference to her. He likes the teeth she is currently wearing, although they do need some adjustment that he will be willing to do. The other set of teeth made by Dr. __  Dr. __ does not like as well. He feels she is over closed too much with those. She still has her muscular dystonia with constant movement of her jaw and facial muscles.

She had problems with the magnesium as it gave her diarrhea and an upset stomach, although initially when she first started taking it, she felt significantly improved. She now has stopped taking it, because even at one tablet she continued to have problems with diarrhea and feeling weak. She continues to complain of pain around her ears and that she feels as though her ear is closed off on the left side, though clinically the ear passage appears relatively normal. She pushes on the back side of the condyle from inside her ear and she says it makes it feel better and then she also can push back on the posterior aspect of the external meatus and it feels better for her at times. At times, her husband is saying that she is clenching and grinding her teeth.

At this time, I decided to start her on another medication, Klonopin 0.5-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x5. We will try the Klonopin and see how it works. We may have to increase the dose or even decrease it some depending on how she responds to it. She states that she has been to several neurologists and they have tried her on various medications, but nothing has really helped her, but most of that was before I did surgery on her. She believes she feels much better since surgery, but still has some difficulties. She does take Prozac, and this may be one of those medications that may cause muscular dystonia type functions. I suggested we try to taper off the Prozac, but try the Klonopin and see what difference this makes. She is to call me in 4 days to let me know how she does.

B274 
She presents for followup evaluation. She had 2 weeks that were very good, but then yesterday she was at some kind of blue grass concert and she was leaning her head forward for a while and this set off some muscle problems for her. She is having difficulty with her dentures. One set fits better than the other. I told her to wear the set that feels the best. She feels better than before the surgery, but still has some issues. Her muscular dystonia may be affecting her. I suggested she try the Klonopin again to see if this makes a difference. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

B274 
X-rays show that there appears to be good space that would be adequate for the discs. She is taking Prozac right now. Apparently, she has elected not to get off of that as I had suggested before. In fact, she had a couple of good weeks and we are going to try the following plan:

Magnesium. Take 1 tablet in the morning for 1 week.
Add a second tablet after 1 week at night.
If this does not work, then consider taking the Klonopin again. She essentially has not taken the Klonopin as prescribed, but takes it only once in a while. Therefore, we do not know if this is effective for her or not.

If we need to reinitiate the Klonopin and it is ineffective, then another medication we could consider would be thorazine. We will see how she progresses. She is to call me in 3-4 weeks.
