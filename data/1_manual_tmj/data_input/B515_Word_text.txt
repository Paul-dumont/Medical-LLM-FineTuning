B515 
B515 is 19 years old. Referred by Dr. XXXX. B515 is not real sure when his TMJ problems began, but thinks it may be around the age of 14 of unknown etiology. He did have orthodontics from the age of 7 to 14. Currently, he gets headaches about five times per week in the frontal, temporal, and top of the head bilaterally. He gets TMJ pain at about a level of 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 8, diet at 4, and disability at 6. He does get earaches, the left side greater than right side, but no tinnitus, frequent vertigo, but no hearing loss. Other joints that bother him include his shoulders, hips, knees, spine, wrists, and ankle. He has been diagnosed as having kyphosis, scoliosis, Sheuermann's disease that involves degenerative disks in the back, and it has even been suggested that her has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. That diagnosis has not been confirmed, but apparently the family is going to look into going to the University of Washington for that testing. In addition, he was born with pectum excavatum and had surgery to correct that at the age of 14, though had complications including pneumonia 2 weeks afterwards and a malrotation of the bar. B515 takes the following medications:

Norco 10/325 two tablets per day.
Diazepam 10 mg b.i.d. but he does not take it all the time.
Adderrall 20 mg time release q.d.
Ibuprofen four times per day.
Soma 350 mg two to three times per day.

His primary concerns are as follows:
Dislocation of his jaws and displaced discs in his joint.
Right side of lower jaw growing faster than the left side. Bite continues to shift and change.
TMJ pain, headaches, and myofascial pain.
Facial asymmetry.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B515 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third face, but some asymmetry in the lower third. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is 6 mm off to the left and chin is about 9 to 10 mm off to the left. There is some increased fullness in his right mandibular angle area extending about 2 to 3 mm wider than the left side. In profile view, B515 has got some AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 4 mm and some sallowness in the cheek area. Chin is retruded about 15 mm. Chin neckline is short, but the chin neckline has reasonable contour. Intraorally, B515 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. He has got a lot of pitting and enamel decalcification in his teeth, particularly on the cervical margins. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has an end-on incisor relatively but a zero over bite. He has a full Class III cuspid relationship on the right side and basically Class I on the left side, but has a cross bite extending from the left central incisor through the second molar. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 2 mm higher than the right side. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. B515 has got high moderate pain over the masseters and mild to moderate pain over most of the rest of the head and neck area except the temporalis muscles are at zero. The incisal opening was 63 mm and where he was comfortable 39 mm. The excursion movement to the right was 7 mm, to the left 4 mm. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly, although he did feel a slight glitch in excursion movements in the left joint.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. He has got a full Class III occlusion on the right side and Class I on the left side. He has got a 3 x 3 retainer in the mandible. Cannot really evaluate the TMJs.

Coronal view shows that the turbinates are relatively moderate in size and sinuses are clear and septum is reasonably straight.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear and the turbinates are of relatively normal size and the septum is reasonably straight.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has an adenoid mass in the nasopharyngeal area. He has got a high occlusal plane angle and probably a Class III skeletal relationship or close to it. He has an end-on incisor relationship.

Basic diagnoses for B515 includes the following:
Probable Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Right mandibular condylar hyperplasia and possible disc dislocation.
Left TMJ condylar resorption with articular disc anteriorly displaced and with multiple cystic synovial hyperplasia. Deviated mandibular prognathism off to the left side. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia. Mandibular dental midline shifted 6 mm to the left and chin shifted about 10 mm to the left of the facial midline. Full Class III cuspid relationship on the right side and Class I cuspid on the left side.
Anterior and left posterior cross bites.
Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 2 mm short vertically compared to the right side.
Generalized decalcifications and some caries.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Earaches.
Vertigo.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Restorative dentistry to repair areas of decalcification and caries.
2.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
3.	Surgery. a.	Right TMJ high condylectomy and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. b.	Left TMJ removal of pathological tissue in the joint with articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. c.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to shift the mandible back on the facial midline and level it transversely as well as rotate it in a counterclockwise direction. d.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward, down graft it posteriorly and upright the incisors.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5.	Restorative dentistry if necessary.

DATE OF ACQUISITION:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is smaller than the opposite side. There appears to be disc tissue in place, but there appears to be multiple small cystic cavities within the disc tissue. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There is increased vertical joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is fairly large in size and fills most all of the fossa. There is decreased vertical joint space. The disc is hard to identify.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is small in size with what appears to be loss of vertical and anteroposterior dimension. There is a mass inside the joint cavity that has displaced the condyle inferiorly. There appears to be small cyst lesions within the tissue between the condyle and the fossa. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There may be some involved discal tissue anterior sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. The condyle is significantly displaced inferiorly with the mass inside the fossa area. The disc is anteriorly displaced, but there is this large cystic lesion posterior to the disc. On opening, there is severe limitation of motion with the condyle coming forward about a third of the normal amount. The articular disc remains anteriorly displaced. The cystic type of lesion overlying the condyle appears to thin some as the condyle loads onto this tissue.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the superior head. The disc may be posteriorly displaced. There appears to be decreased superior joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination and is fairly long in length. There is virtually no translation and only a moderate amount of rotation. There appears to be fluid in the superior joint space. I still believe the disc could be posteriorly displaced. In some views, it appears that the disc could be posteriorly displaced or anteriorly displaced. Vertical joint space is narrow.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and condylar resorption, anteriorly displaced disc and with a cystic formation within the joint space. Right TMJ enlarged condyle with an articular disc may be anteriorly or posteriorly displaced.

DATE OF ACQUISITION:
Only the dynamic views are shown here. The left TMJ opening sequence shows that there is some arthritis in the joint and the articular disc is anteriorly displaced and nonreducing on opening, although there is restricted translation. The disc is deformed as it is short in anteroposterior length and thickened.

Right TMJ shows a disc that has a little bit better morphology, but it is anteriorly displaced. On opening, it does not reduce. In fact, there is virtually no translation of the right condyle.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction with moderate deformation but still may be salvageable. Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with reduction.
