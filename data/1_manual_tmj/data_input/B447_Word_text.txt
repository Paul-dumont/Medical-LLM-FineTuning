B447 
B447 is 14 years old. She is referred by Dr. XXXX.
Patient History

She has had some knee problems and some allergies. She has had some baby teeth extracted. B447 is a soccer player, and she does have some problems with her knees swelling because of kneecap positions and stability factors.

B447 originally saw Dr. XXXX about 2-1/2 years ago about getting braces. She didn't pursue the braces but went back to see Dr. XXXX about two months ago. Dr. XXXX noticed that there was a significant shift in B447's bite from the previous time that he had seen her. She apparently is hitting only on her back teeth, and the front teeth are apart some. It is unknown when any problems began but apparently sometime within the last 2 to 2-1/2 years. The etiology is unknown. She has had no treatment for her jaws yet. She has been to see Dr. XXXX for evaluation of tongue thrush. She also has seen Dr. XXXX. Dr. XXXX is an allergist. Dr. XXXX found that she has some allergies to some grasses and placed her on Nasalcort that she uses once a day.

She has no trouble with earaches, tinnitus, or hearing loss but does have occasional vertigo. She does have allergies to grasses and molds but no known food allergies. She has no known allergies to jewelry. She is not aware of any problems with clenching or bruxing. She has no problems with headaches, TMJ, or myofascial pain. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability all at 0.

Current Medications
Rhinocort nasal spray
Motrin occasionally
Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B447 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 1 mm. Maxillary midline is about a millimeter off to the left. Mandibular dental midline is about 3 mm off to the left. Chin is about 3 mm off to the left.

In profile view, she has fairly good facial balance. Could have just slight AP deficiency in the chin area but not too significantly.
Intraorally, B447 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Some minor spacing around the lower anterior teeth. Appears to have adequate attached gingiva although relatively thin in a vertical dimension. Appears to have a little bit of a lingual inclination tendency of the lower incisors.

In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a slight Class II occlusion on the right side by maybe 1 to 2 mm, and on the left side she is Class II by probably 3 to 4 mm. She has an anterior open bite of about 2 mm in the incisors and about 2 to 3 mm in the lateral incisor area. Appears to occlude only on her first and second molars on the left side and also on the right side. She has a crossbite on the left posterior side. Oropharyngeal area looks relatively normal, and the soft palate and uvula are normal size and shape. Maximal incisal opening is 49 mm. Excursive movements to the right are 6 mm and to the left 7 mm. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area.

On opening, she has clicking and popping in both joints but more audible and palpable on the left side as compared to the right side. Opening click occurs somewhere between 5 to 10 mm of opening and closing click closer to about 5 mm.

Intranasally, the turbinates are of moderate size. Luminal valves are creating some constricture inside the nose. Holding those valves open, B447 could breathe a lot better through her nose. Columella may be must slightly wide, but appears that there is more obstruction with the luminal valves than related to the columella. When B447 was 12 years, 2 months of age, she had a normal bite relationship with a Class I skeletal occlusal relationship and a relatively normal anterior vertical overbite.

As B447 rotates her mandible toward the right side about 3 mm, it does improve her facial balance.
Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows that the sinuses appear fairly clear. She has four impacted third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. Right turbinate appears enlarged. Condyles appear flattened anteriorly.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates are moderate in size, but the left side particularly seems to obliterate most of the nasal airway. Mandibular dental midline is shifted about 3 mm off to the left of the facial midline. Bony septum is relatively straight.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears very narrow anteroposteriorly. Could be some loss of condylar volume. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space actually appears reasonably well-balanced.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit larger in size, but it appears to have some pseudocysts in the condylar head, one posteriorly and one anteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space appears to be decreased posteriorly but appears better balanced vertically and anteriorly.

Open views show there is fairly good translation of both condyles. Both condyles look narrow anteroposteriorly in the open view with the right side looking more narrow as compared to the left one. Both condyles appear as though there has been volume loss.

Cephalometrically, B447 has perhaps a slight Class II skeletal relationship but not too significantly. She has a definite anterior open bite of probably 2 mm and overjet of probably 1 to 2 mm. Mandibular plane angle is increased in angulation as compared to the maxillary plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway looks good.

There is a mild tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1 mm probably related to small upper lateral incisors. Right lateral incisor is smaller than the left lateral incisor in the upper arch. However, hand articulation of the models may end up with the cuspids being probably a couple of millimeters Class II. Also, there is a tendency toward crossbite bilaterally posteriorly.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and articular disc dislocations with reduction
AP mandibular deficiency
Transverse maxillary deficiency
Class II end-on occlusion
Mandibular dental midline shifted 2 mm to the left of the maxillary dental midline
Class II end-on occlusion, worse on the left side as compared to the right side
Anterior open bite
Occluding only on the first and second molars bilaterally with all other teeth out of occlusion
Mild tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1 mm
Small diasthemas around the lower lateral incisors bilaterally
Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4
Hypertrophied turbinates
Partial nasal airway obstruction
Constricture of luminal valves
Predominantly mouth breather when sleeping

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch. Try to minimize retraction of lower incisors Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Multiple maxillary osteotomies to expand and vertically level the arch
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction
Partial inferior turbinectomies
Surgical removal of impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Appears to be decreased vertical joint space. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Fossa itself seems to be more medially positioned than normal. Appears to be discal tissues anterior and medial to the condylar head. Cortical bone appears for the most part to be intact.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Appears to be decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Appears the disc is medially and anteriorly displaced. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Cortical bone appears thin but appears for the most part to be intact.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is fairly steep and somewhat long particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. It is actually steeper toward the mesial aspect but shorter in vertical length. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced but seems to have fairly good form. No particular inflammatory process seen in the joint.

On opening, there appears to be early reduction and good translation of both the condyle and the articular disc.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears to have a little bit more osseous changes. A little bit of flattening on the anterior aspect. A little bit more of a hockey stick shape to the condyle. Condyle may be a little bit more narrow anteroposteriorly compared to the opposite side. Articular eminence is fairly steep and is longer in length at the lateral aspect of the joint as compared to the medial. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced. No significant inflammation is seen in the joint.

On opening, there is early reduction and good translation of both the condyle and the fossa.
Impression:
Left TMJ relatively minimal arthritic changes, but articular disc is anteriorly displaced with early reduction
Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction
