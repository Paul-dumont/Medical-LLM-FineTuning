B139
B139 is 14 years old. Referred by Dr. XXXX. B139 is currently under orthodontic treatment by Dr. XXXX. B139 began orthodontic treatment one year and seven months ago and has had her appliances off for about 18 months now. Primary concerns that B139 and her family have include the following:

Protruding jaw.
Teeth and jaws do not fit together. Headaches.
Clicking and popping in the jaw joints.
She is currently not taking any medications, and she has no other major medical conditions. B139 dances modern, jazz, and tap. Last year she had some bursitis in her hip. She does have some problems with her knees.

She gets headaches only about two times in a month in the frontal and temporal area at about a level of 3. She rates her TMJ discomfort about 3, but on an average day she does not really have any pain problems. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability at 0. She has no problems with earaches or vertigo, but gets occasional tinnitus. The only other joints that bother her at this time are her knees. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She takes no medications. She is predominantly a mouth breather, and, even observing her sitting here in the office, she predominantly breathes through her mouth. She does not apparently have difficulties with snoring, daytime somnolence, or sleep apnea symptoms. Her joint problems where she has developed clicking and popping in the TMJs began this year at the age of 14 of unknown etiology.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B139 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship appears to be about 3.5 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline and chin. The nasal tip may be just about 1 mm off to the right side. On profile view, she has fairly good balance between the upper lips, cheeks, and nose. She has a lip incompetence of probably about 8 mm. The lower lip appears protrusive. Chin may be just slightly protrusive. Chin neckline is elongated, and the chin neck angle is well defined. AP position of the chin may be just slightly strong. The lower lip is protrusive by probably 8 mm or so. Intraorally, B139 has all of her lower teeth back to the second molars present. She has orthodontic appliances on. She has some spacing between the lower incisors and between the cuspids and first bicuspids. Mandibular left second bicuspid is malrotated. In the upper arch, she has had first bicuspids extracted. She has small upper lateral incisors. She is probably 5 to 6 mm Class III in the cuspid area on the right side and probably 6 to 7 mm on the left side. She has an anterior crossbite, although the molars appear to be expanded and not in a crossbite. She has an open bite of about 1 mm. She has an overjet of probably close to 8 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively healthy. Tonsils are moderate in size. Intranasally, turbinates are moderately enlarged. Septum appears reasonably straight. On opening, B139 deviates the mandible towards the right side about 3 to 4 mm. At times, she appears to have a closed lock on the right side, but with some manipulation she can usually get open fairly wide. Occasionally, she would have a pop on opening and more consistently she would have a closing pop. Maximal incisal opening is about 50 mm. Excursion movement to the right about 9 mm and to the left about 8 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows elongation of the condylar heads and necks. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. She has four impacted third molars. Axial view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear significantly enlarged with the right side being larger than the left side. Coronal view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear quite enlarged particularly on the right side and actually the right middle turbinate appears significantly enlarged compared to the left side. Left TMJ tomogram shows the condylar head and neck appear quite long and the size of the condyle appears small. The articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. There is decreased posterior joint space. Anterior and vertical joint spaces appear relatively normal. Out laterally, there may be some decreased vertical joint space. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. The condylar head and neck appear elongated.
Left TMJ coronal view shows a fairly good vertical joint space and a slight decreased joint space at the lateral pole of the condyle. The condyle is slightly narrow in the mediolateral width. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that may be moderately deficient in transverse width, but there appears to be fairly good joint space. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a Class III skeletal and occlusal relationship. She has some adenoid tissues still in the nasopharynx area. Oropharyngeal airway appears slightly decreased in AP dimension. There is a moderately high occlusal plane angle. There is a major Class III occlusal adjustment, but the skeletal position does not appear to be that far off. She has a Bolton's difference of about 2.5 mm. Her teeth particularly in the models shows even a greater discrepancy because of the spacing in the lower arch.

B139's great-grandmother has a protruding lower jaw, but apparently no one else in the family has this. B139's grandfather apparently had a very strong lower jaw.

Basic diagnoses for B139 would be as follows:
Bilateral mandibular condylar hyperplasia. Right TMJ articular disc dislocation with inconsistent reduction. Mandibular prognathism. Anterior vertical maxillary hyperplasia and transverse hyperplasia.
Impacted third molars x4.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain. Occasional headaches. Class III occlusion.
Anterior crossbite. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm. Minor spacing between most of the lower anterior teeth.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Retract the cuspids against the second bicuspids and open up 1 mm of space between the laterals and cuspids on each side. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Place a power chain on the lower arch to close the residual spacing between the anterior teeth. Surgery. Bilateral TMJ high condylectomy with articular disc repositioning with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to set the mandible posteriorly with a slight counterclockwise rotation.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it slightly, move it superiorly, and decrease the occlusal plane and correct transverse discrepancies. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B139 MRI AGE: 14/F
Dynamic View: Left TMJ shows a long condylar head and neck. The articular disc appears to be in position. On opening, there appears to be good translation of the condylar head and the condyle. On the right side, the condylar head and neck appear elongated. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and does not appear to reduce on opening.

IMPRESSION (based on just the dynamic films):
Left TMJ relative normal position of the articular disc. Right TMJ articular disc anteriorly displaced.
