B412 
B412 is 11 years old and is referred by Dr. XX.
Patient History

B412 has had previous problems with ear infections and flu virus and does have some allergy problems and a little bit of hay fever problems. She currently takes Naproxen 250 mg b.i.d. B412's problems began maybe about a year to a year-and-a-half ago. This past May, she did develop some significant TMJ-associated pain that was identified. The etiology of her problems is unknown. She takes Naproxen b.i.d. She has been on this since August. She gets occasional earaches but no problems with tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints apparently bother her at this time. She probably does some mouth breathing, but she is not really aware of it. She rates her headaches that occur about once a month in the frontal and temporal areas at about a level of 5. She doesn't feel as though she has any significant TMJ pain. She rates her overall head and neck pain at an average of about 3, but it can escalate to 7 for her.

Clinical Evaluation
In frontal view, B412 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry with maybe a little bit more fullness on the right side as compared to the left side but not too significantly. Upper lip length is about 17 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 3 to 3.5 mm. Maxillary dental midline, mandibular dental midline, and chin are all pretty much on the facial midline.

In profile view, she seems to have fairly good balance between the upper lips, cheeks, and nose. Chin appears retruded, and she appears to have a high mandibular plane angle and occlusal plane angle facial morphology. Chin is retracted fairly close to 15 mm. Chin-neckline is not well defined.

Intraorally, she has a retained primary E on the left side but has the rest of her teeth back through the first molars. She recently had a lower primary right E removed, and the permanent tooth is not yet erupted in but appears to be adequate space for it. No particular crowding in the lower anterior arch. Minimal attached gingiva in the lower anterior arch. Appears to have an accentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch.

In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the first molars except she has retained E's. She has a small upper lateral incisor on the left side. A primary C is still present in the upper arch as well. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship bilaterally. She has an overjet of about 3 mm and vertical overbite of probably about 2 mm. Oropharynx appears clear. Tonsils are present but relatively normal size and appear non-inflamed.

Intranasally, right turbinate appears relatively moderate in size. Left turbinate appears enlarged. She has a wide columella base and somewhat narrow nostrils. Opening up the nostrils with the nasal speculum made it significantly easier for her to breathe.

To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the masseters and medial pterygoid areas and mild to moderate discomfort over the left TMJ. Maximum incisal opening is 42 mm. Excursive movements are about 10 mm in each direction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the presence of maxillary C's and E's. Permanent right second bicuspid is congenitally absent. The permanent cuspids are developing appropriately. In the lower arch, she has a retained E on the left side, and both second bicuspids are developing, although there are some slight mal-rotations with the crowns being rotated distally on both sides. Left turbinate appears large. Sinuses appear relatively clear. There appear to be some significant effects on the condyles and perhaps some evidence of condylar resorption with a greater amount of resorption being present on the right side as compared to the left side.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle positioned slightly anteriorly in the fossa. Articular eminence is quite flattened. Head of the condyle is quite flattened. May be increased posterior joint space. Mandible appears to be in a high mandibular plane angle. Could be a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has some changes in it and appears that there is a pseudocyst in the head of the condyle. The condylar head and neck are a little bit longer on this side as compared to the right side. Articular eminence is relatively shallow but not as shallow as the opposite site. On both sides, the cranial contents appear to dip down into the articular eminence area. Roof of the fossa is extremely thin. A high occlusal plane angle is observed on this side as well.

Opening shows good translation of both condyles, although there appears to be decreased vertical joint space particularly on the right side between the condyle and articular eminence.

Waters view shows some slight asymmetry in the mandible with the right side being a little bit higher than the left side. Septal spur present in the right side of the nose. On the left side, the turbinate appears quite large and seems to obliterate most of the nasal airway.

Cephalometrically, B412 has a skeletal Class II relationship and high occlusal plane and high mandibular plane angle facial morphology. Oropharyngeal airway actually looks reasonably good. Inferior turbinates look quite large vertically and extend a little bit beyond the hard palate area. Occlusion appears end-on Class II.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocations without reduction
TMJ pain
Headaches Myofascial pain
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular deficiency
High occlusal plane angle
Class II end-on occlusion Retained primary maxillary C's and E's and mandibular left E
Congenitally missing maxillary right second bicuspid
Unerupted maxillary cuspids, left second bicuspid, and bilateral mandibular second bicuspids as well as all four second molars
Hypertrophied turbinate in the left naris
Deviated nasal septum with nasal spur on the right side
Partial nasal airway obstruction
Wide columella base creating narrow nostrils (holding the nostrils open significantly improved her ability to breathe through her nose)

Recommended Treatment
Surgery, Stage 1
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors
Consider extraction of maxillary C's and E's as well as the maxillary left second bicuspid. Consider extracting mandibular left E in this area to help with development of eruption of the associated second bicuspid

Presurgical orthodontics
Align and level maxillary arch. Retract upper first bicuspids to help make room for the upper cuspids as well as to open up space around the upper left lateral incisor, which is severely deformed. Minimize loss of posterior anchorage by allowing the first molars to come forward no more than 2 to 3 mm. Open up about 2 to 3 mm of space around the upper left lateral incisor
Align and level mandibular arch.

Monitor facial growth and development. Recommend not proceeding on with surgery, stage 2, until B412 is 14 to 15 years of age
Surgery, Stage 2
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxilla superiorly slightly, downgraft the posterior aspect, and correct any transverse problems that may be present.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Consider possible turbinectomies if indicated for nasal airway factors.
Consider possible nasal septoplasty if contributing to nasal airway factors.
Consider reconstructing the columella to open up the nostrils and improve anterior airway.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B412  MRI Evaluation  
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width, although it may be somewhat reduced. Appears to be some increased joint space. Difficult to tell where the disc is but it may be anteriorly positioned. Downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa is fairly shallow. Roof of the fossa is extremely thin.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears to have undergone some resorption and appears to be quite short vertically more so than the opposite side. Slight downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Joint space may be slightly increased. Difficult to identify discal tissue.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has some significant anterior beaking and appears to have a loss of vertical height. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is quite shortened anteroposteriorly and has thickening of both the anterior and posterior bands. Increased vertical posterior joint space. Sort of an amorphous kind of material appearing in the upper joint space. Just a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but no other significant inflammatory process present.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle but appears that the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears to have undergone some resorptive changes. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and fairly significantly deformed with significant shortness anteroposteriorly. The disc is sitting beneath the articular eminence. Appears to be an osteophytic kind of projection off the posterior head of the condyle. Increased superior and posterior joint spaces. No particular inflammatory process seen within the joint except for some inflammation that may be present in the bilaminar tissues posteriorly.

On opening, there appears to be good translation of the condyle but without reduction of the articular disc.
Impression:
Left TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocation without reduction
Right TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocation without reduction and moderate degenerative changes of the articular disc
