B410 
B410 is 27 years old and referred by XX.
Patient History

B410 has had previous problems with kidney stones, migraines, and seizures. She has had numerous TMJ surgeries. The seizure problem that B410 has is felt to be related to her migraines and perhaps being further triggered by bright sunlight. She had one last 2 years ago and fell, hitting the sidewalk. She has had a few others at home, and she has even had one while she has been driving.

She apparently has had allergic reactions to PENICILLIN, ANCEF, TIGAN, AND ZOFRAN.
B410's problems began 14 years ago when she underwent orthognathic surgery. She had been in braces for quite some time and had an anterior open bite. She did have a history of finger sucking that may have contributed to the open bite. Also, there is a possibility that she may have had ICR that was unrecognized and relatively asymptomatic. Following the orthognathic surgical procedures, she had her jaws wired together for approximately six weeks. As soon as the wires were removed, and she started to function her jaws, she began having clicking and popping in her jaw joints, and then it began to lock on her by September of that year. She has had numerous TMJ procedures including open joints and a lot of arthrocenteses. Those dates and procedures are attached from B410's handwritten notes. One major procedure occurred 11 years ago when she had a rib graft placed in the right TMJ. It ankylosed, and 2 years ago the joint was debrided on the right side but apparently re-ankylosed again.

Other treatments that she has had include for the last several years Botox injections into her facial muscles, and she recently has been getting Botox injections around he head and neck area. Another procedure she had done bilaterally was cadaver cartilage placed bilaterally in both joints. This was approximately 5 years ago when that procedure was performed.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B410 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third face. She has asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3.5 mm. Nasal tip is off to the left side just about a millimeter. Maxillary midline is off to the right 1 mm. Mandibular dental midline is about 4 mm off the facial midline, and the chin is about 8 to 9 mm off to the right side.

In profile view, she has some slight AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 3 or 4 mm. Chin is approximately 20 to 25 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline is extremely short, and chin-neck angle is poorly defined. B410 has lip incompetence of about 10 mm. B410 has a cant in the maxillary occlusal plane with the right cuspid being about 2 mm higher than the left cuspid. Intraorally, B410 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. She has a 3 x 3 lower retainer in place. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has crowns on the left maxillary first and second molars. She has a reverse curve of occlusion in the anterior lower arch and accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch. She has an anterior open bite of 4 mm. She has a Class II occlusal relationship on the right side end-on probably 5 mm Class II. On the left side, she is probably just 2 mm Class II. She has an accentuated curve of Wilson particularly in the upper arch. She has good attached gingiva around the anterior teeth.

B410 rates her daily headaches that occur in a band form including the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area at about a level of 9. These occur almost daily. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, overall average daily pain levels around the head and neck area at 8, jaw function at 9, diet at 7, and disability at 8. Maximal incisal opening is 33 mm and 26 mm without significant pain. Excursive movements to the right are about 2 mm and to the left 0. To palpation, she has severe pain over the TMJs, high moderate pain over the masseters, medial pterygoids, styloid areas, and moderate discomfort over the SCMs and shoulder area. Temporalis muscles and posterior neck muscles elicited no pain to palpation today, but on 12/31 she had Botox injections to the temporalis muscles and to her posterior neck and cranial base areas.

Intranasally, turbinates appear relatively moderate in size. Septum is deviated significantly off toward the right side with a large spur probably causing some airway obstruction. Uvula is difficult to see but appears sort of mildly enlarged. Soft palate may be excessive long. Faucial pillars are mild to moderate in their constriction. Columella appears relatively normal, and luminal valves appears relatively normal.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Difficult to evaluate the sinuses and the nasal airway. There are bone screws x 3 in each of the rami. In the right joint, there is a lot of heterotopic reactive bone around a sort of a stubby looking condyle that is remaining on that side. This side was previously rib grafted. Left condyle also appears severe arthritic.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are relatively clear. Septum is a little bit deviated toward the left in the bony area but cannot see the cartilage area. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Mandibular asymmetry can be appreciated as well as the maxillary vertical asymmetry.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a large mass of heterotopic bone formation around the joint area. Three screws are seen in the ascending ramus toward the anterior aspect of it. Coronoid process is absent.

Left TMJ shows a lot of arthritic changes present. Cannot really delineate any joint space. Three bone screws are present in the ascending ramus area.

On opening, there may be a little bit of translation in the left joint, but right joint appears to have more of a hinge-type function. Opening is actually reasonably good considering the nature of the pathology present.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows there are two occlusal plane levels and two inferior border levels with the right side being shorter than the left side in both those areas. Mandible is significantly retruded. Reverse curve of occlusion, lower arch, slightly accentuating the upper arch. Anterior open bite present and a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship is present. Oropharyngeal airway is severely constricted with the oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue being approximately 3 mm and at the soft palate level being about 3.5 mm (normal 11 mm). High occlusal plane angle is present. Appears to be retrusion obviously of the mandible but also AP retrusion of the maxilla as well.

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Tip maxillary lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align the teeth at two different occlusal plane levels and in three segments:
Segment 1: Left cuspid through right first molar. Place a bracket on the second molar but without the arch wire
Segment 2: Left lateral incisor through right lateral incisor
Segment 3: Right cuspid through right first molar but place a bracket on the second molar but do not engage the arch wire. Place a step in the arch wire between the cuspids and lateral incisors to align the four incisors at an elevated plane compared to the posterior teeth
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing about 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure and retract and try to elevate the incisors a millimeter or so to help eliminate the reverse curve of occlusion. Place brackets on all the lower teeth, but do not engage the second molars in the arch wire

B410  MRI Scan Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Reading: 

Axial views show severe bilateral arthritic changes of the condyles.
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows evidence of previous surgery with the presence of bone screws in the mandible. Condyle is extremely arthritic. There appears to be reactive bone that has formed in the fossa on that side. There is some joint space present, although there could be a fibrous or a light bony ankylosis present.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows evidence of previous surgery as there are bone screws present in the ramus area. She has severe arthritic changes and has a bony ankylosis of the right TMJ with significant bone formation on the medial side and extending out laterally to the fossa. There is a major amount of reactive heterotopic bone formation around the TMJ area.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has undergone significant arthritic changes. Significant increased thickness of the roof of the joint indicative of heterotopic bone formation.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows extreme lateral positioning of the condyle with heterotopic reactive bone formation around it. There is severe arthritis affecting the condylar head and evidence of bony ankylosis. There is evidence of previous surgery on the coronoid process as well with bone formation still remaining above the remaining aspect of the coronoid area.
