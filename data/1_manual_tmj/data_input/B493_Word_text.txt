B493 said her jaw joint problems have been present for as long as she can remember. Time of onset is unknown and etiology is unknown. She has had no treatment for her jaw situation. Her TMJ pain is about a level of 4, headaches at a level of 7, predominately on the right side and temporal towards the front and also towards the back of the head. She said it feels like a nail being driven into her head. She was told by a neurologist that she had migraine headaches. They did decrease after she had her hysterectomy 6 years ago. She does get some tingling in her right cheek area. She rates her average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 4, diet probably around 2, disability at 5. She has occasional problems with her right shoulder. She is aware of clenching at night and also during the day. No earaches but she does get tinnitus and some vertigo. She states that she is sometimes sleepy during the day but attributes that to staying up late at night. She has no difficulties sleeping at night.

In frontal view, B493 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm on the right and may be 2 mm on the left. Maxillary dental midline is maybe 1 mm to the left of facial midline. The nasal tip is deviated off towards the right side. Maxillary midline is actually fairly close to being on the facial midline as is the mandibular midline and the chin. The nasal tip is actually slightly to the right side about 2 mm. In profile view, the maxilla is retruded about 3 to 4 mm. The chin is retruded about 15 to 18 mm. Chin-neckline is short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has a crown on the mandibular left first molar. She has some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has some transverse deficiency in the arch width particularly in the bicuspid area. She has lingual tori present. She has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back to the second molars present. Some mild crowding in the upper anterior arch. In the lower arch the right cuspid is about 1 mm posterior to the left cuspid. In the upper arch the cuspids are fairly symmetric to each other. She has also a full Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally. 

She had an anterior deep bite of about 5 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and relatively normal in size. The tonsils are gone. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size. Anteriorly the septum is deviated off towards the right side. In the mid part the septum is deviated off towards the left side. To palpation she has no pain around the head and neck area except directly over the joints where on the right side she has a level of about 4 and on the left side some discomfort may be a level of 2. Maximal incisal opening is about 41 mm. Excursive movement to the right 8 mm, left 10 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars but all the rest of the teeth are present. Sinuses appear reasonably clear. Some moderate changes in the condyle are evident. She appears to have a low angle mandibular morphology.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is postured down forward in the fossa and probably not taken into centric relation. There are increased superior and posterior joint spaces.

Right TMJ tomogram taken a little bit better centric but still probably not in a true centric relation. Slight increased joint space vertically and posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep as it is on the other side. On opening, there is reasonable translation of both condyles.

Waters view shows that at least the bony septum appears fairly straight although anteriorly the cartilaginous septum demonstrates deviation. Turbinates are moderate in size.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has some slight AP maxillary deficiency and AP mandibular deficiency and a skeletal and an occlusal Class II relationship. She has anterior deep bite. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 8 mm at the soft palate and about slightly less than 4 at the base of the tongue. The lower incisors appear over angulated.

B493 has a tooth discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of approximately 3 mm. She has a tooth size discrepancy in the bicuspid area also of about ½ mm with each tooth.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Transverse maxillary deficiency. AP mandibular deficiency.
Class II occlusion.
Anterior deep bite of 5 mm. Significant crowding in the lower anterior arch.
Mild crowding of upper anterior arch.
Bilateral mandibular tori.
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation at the lateral aspect of the joint but with reduction on opening.  

Headaches. TMJ pain. Decreased oropharyngeal airway of only 4 mm (normal dimension of 11 mm.) Difficulty swallowing. Snoring. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3 mm with the anterior 6 teeth and ½ mm with each of the end bicuspids.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 3 mm of tooth structure from the anterior 6 teeth and remove ½ mm of tooth structure from each lower bicuspid. This should help keep from flaring the lower teeth any further forward.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to downgraft the posterior aspect, advance it anteriorly and correct the transverse deficiency. Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to advance the chin about 4 mm.
Postsurgical orthodontics to finalize occlusion.

B493 
Telephone conversation with Dr. XX: Discussed her treatment. She has significant tooth size discrepancy so slenderizing the lower anterior teeth and also slenderizing the lower bicuspids may enable us to treat her without doing extractions. He will be seeing her with in the next week or so. He will contact me if there any questions or concerns.

B493 MRI EVALUATION  
AGE: 53/F
DOB: 
Date of MRI Acquisition: .
Date of Interpretation:  

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic. There are some areas of sclerosis on the top. A little bit of irregularity on the top of the condyle. The disc appears to be anteromedially displaced. There is decreased lateral joint space. It appears that half the condyle is uncovered by the disc in a mediolateral direction. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to be larger in size than the opposite side. The lateral pole of the condyle appears to extend beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 4 mm. There is significantly decreased joint space at the lateral rim. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced. A little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle but not quite as significant as the opposite side.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of superior peaking. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint but more medially it is in a better position. There is fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in a reduced position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some flattening on the anterior head and some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint but more medially it is in a better position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and articular disc with the disc in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocated particularly the lateral aspect of the joint as well as some medial displacement but with reduction on opening.
Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocated particularly the lateral aspect of the joint as well as some medial displacement but with reduction on opening.
