B010
B010 is 51 years old. She was referred by XXX. B010's onset of her TMJ problems began when she was about 49, 2 years ago, when she had a third molar removed from the left side. Since then, she has had severe headache and jaw pain on the left side of her face. Previous treatment has included laser treatment without any significant improvement. She received a splint last month and has just started wearing it, and she wore it one night and it made her right side hurt worse. She has almost constant headaches and that occur predominantly on the left side and almost daily reach a level of 10. She rates her TMJ pain at 10, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 2, diet at 4, disability at 0. She has left-sided earaches, but no tinnitus but does get occasional vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing. She takes Vicodin only occasionally for pain and she was taking Naproxen 375 mg twice a day, but she has discontinued that. She was recently given a prescription for prednisone by Dr. XXX. Her dentist is Dr. XXX.

In frontal view, B010 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length measures about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 1 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty close to being on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline and chin. In profile, she has some maxillary AP deficiency of about 2 to 3 mm. Chin appears to be AP deficient by probably 12 to 15 mm. Chin neckline is not defined. Intraorally, B010 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch, but has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has her teeth back through the first molar on the right side and on the left side the second and third molars appear to be absent. She is basically a Class I cuspid relationship bilaterally with about 2.5 mm vertical overbite. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Intranasally, the airway looks good with the turbinates being relatively normal in size and the septum has some deviation, but not real significant. On opening, the mandible shifts 5 mm to the right side. The maximal opening is 42 mm, opening without pain 15 mm. The excursion movement to the right is 10 mm, to the left 6 mm. To palpation, she has high moderate low severe pain over the left TMJ and moderate pain over the left masseter, left temporalis, left retromandibular area. On opening, she has a soft click in the left joint at about 10 mm of opening and then at 5 mm of closing. The right joint functions smoothly, although the mandible does deviate significantly off to that side by 5 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and the maxillary second molars bilaterally. The sinuses appear relatively clear and bony septum appears relatively straight. The joints appear a little bit arthritic.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology, but decreased superior joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that actually appears a little bit more arthritic than the left side and there is decreased superior joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 4 to 5 mm. This joint actually looks as though the arthritis is more progressive than the left side.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking and decreased vertical and posterior joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic with anterior beaking and decreased vertical joint space. There are some degenerative changes that appear to be present also in the fossa area. The articular eminence is relatively shallow. There is decreased vertical and posterior joint space.

Coronal view shows that the turbinates are normal in size and the sinuses are clear and the septum appears reasonably straight.
Axial views shows that the septum is straight. Turbinates are normal in size and the sinuses are clear.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II relationship, although fairly close to a Class I cuspid relationship. She has a high occlusal plane angle and she has a decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of about 7 mm at the base of the tongue and probably about 5 mm at the soft palate level.

Basic diagnoses for B010 would be as follows:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with probable significant degenerative changes. Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
AP microgenia.
High occlusal plane angle. Crowding in the lower anterior arch. Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of about 4 mm.
Severe left-sided TMJ pain. Severe left-sided headaches. Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatments would be as follows: Treatment option #1 probable most ideal result would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring the lower incisors too far forward.
2.	CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
3.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to augment the chin. d.	Fat grafts to bilateral joint prostheses (harvest from the abdomen). e.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy. f.	Bilateral coronoidotomies.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion and place retainers.

Treatment option #2 to minimize overall treatment would include the following recommendations:
1.	Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
2.	Left mandibular ramus osteotomy to maintain the occlusion, but make room for the disc in the joint.
3.	Application of maxillary and mandibular arch bars.

A model will be very helpful in finalizing the diagnoses.
