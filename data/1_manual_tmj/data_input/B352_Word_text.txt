B352 
B352 is 29 years old and referred by Dr. __.
Patient History
B352 problems began 4 years ago when she was involved in a motor vehicle accident. She later also was involved in an accident 2 years ago. In accident 4 years ago, she sustained injuries including TMJ, back, and neck. 3 years ago, she underwent bilateral TMJ tie-back procedures and arthroplasties. She did okay for a short time and then began developing problems again. She was in fairly severe pain and was ready to have surgery again when she had the accident 2 years ago but proceeded on with the surgery 2 years ago that included again bilateral TMJ tie-backs and arthroplasties. 2 years ago, she was taken back to surgery and thinks that she probably had at least one of the joints reopened again, and she had what sounds to be bilateral vertical ramus osteotomies. She has been in a splint ever since college to help her with her clenching and bruxism. She has continued to wear that splint. She has had physical therapy for almost five years since her accident. She has had acupuncture, hypnosis, electrical stimulation, radiofrequency treatment, ultrasonic treatment, and HVG (high voltage galvanometer, similar to a TENS device) without improvement.

She gets horrible earaches and has a lot of popping in her ears. She gets some tinnitus and some occasional vertigo. She recently had her hearing testing, and she had evidence of hearing loss. She has no known allergies and no problems with jewelry, although her mother has trouble with cheap earrings. She is very much aware of having nocturnal clenching and bruxism. She rates her headaches at a level of 8 basically through the head area, and these occur daily. TMJ pain is a level of 9, overall pain on an average day is about 7, jaw function at 6, diet at 3, and disability at 5. Other joints that bother B352 include her neck and her back.

Clinical Examination

In frontal view, B352 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary midline appear to be pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted about a millimeter off to the right.

In profile, B352 has a little bit of AP deficiency in the maxilla. Chin appears somewhat retruded by approximately 12 to 15 mm.
Intraorally, B352 is missing the lower first bicuspids but has the rest of her teeth. Some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. Has adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she is missing the first bicuspid on the left side and on the right side the first bicuspid, first molar, and all four third molars are absent. She is just slightly end-on Class II by maybe 2 mm. Has about a 4 to 5-mm anterior deep-bite relationship. Oropharynx appears clear. Posterior faucial pillars may be a little bit posteriorly postured. Uvula is relatively normal in size.

Nasal septum has several turns and bends in it. Turbinates are relatively normal in size. It appears she has a good nasal airway. To palpation, she has rather severe pain and gets shooting kinds of pains to the TMJs in the styloid areas at about a level of 5 and in the masseter areas some rather mild tenderness. Joints seem to function reasonably smoothly, and she says they have since her last surgery. Maximum incisal opening is 41 mm but only about 26 mm without significant pain and discomfort. Excursive movements are about 4 mm in each direction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the sinuses appear fairly clear. Turbinates appear a little bit large. She is missing maxillary right first bicuspid, first and third molars, maxillary left lateral incisor, first bicuspid, and third molar. The missing left maxillary lateral incisor has been replaced with a bridge. In the lower arch, she is missing bilateral first bicuspids and third molars. Condyles show severe osteoarthritic changes, and the right one has significant anterior beaking. Fossa also appears somewhat deformed.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle postured posteriorly in the fossa. Articular eminence looks fairly prominent, and it is significantly elongated and just appears as though there is a lot of reaction particularly bony reaction around it. Condyle appears posteriorly positioned in the fossa and appears to be an increased joint space.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with major anterior beaking present and a lot of sclerosis in the head of the condyle. Articular eminence appears flattened and as though it has been reshaped. May be some reactive bone in the fossa area. Some major arthritic changes are present in both joints. In the open views, both condyles are very limited in their transitory abilities, and there are significant osteoarthritic changes with the left condyle appearing much smaller in size than normal and the right appearing much larger particularly involving the anterior beaking that is present.

Waters view shows that the nasal airway appears reasonably good. Sinuses are all clear.
Cephalometrically, B352 has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship. She has severe constricture of the oropharyngeal airway with an airway measurement of only about 2.5 mm at the soft palate level and only about 3 at the base of the tongue. Lower incisors appear to be overangulated.

Of interest is that B352 is on thyroid medication but has never had any documented thyroid problems. She had reported to her pain doctor that she was tired, and so he said, “Well try this” and put her on thyroid medication. Tooth-size analysis reveals a Bolton's difference of 1 mm. However, the lower incisors are overangulated, and the upper incisors are more vertical in orientation. In addition, the anteroposterior width of the incisal edges is greater than usual, and, therefore, we probably have at least a 3-mm tooth-size discrepancy.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral severe TMJ arthritis and articular disc degeneration
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency
Slight AP maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular deficiency
High occlusal plane angulation
Class II end-on occlusal relationship

Mild crowding, lower anterior arch
Overangulation of lower incisors
Vertical inclination of maxillary incisors
Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 to 3 mm
Missing all four first bicuspids, all four third molars, maxillary right first molar, as well as the maxillary left lateral incisor (replaced with a pontic)
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of only 2 to 3 mm (normal 11 mm)

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics
Align and level maxillary arch. Maintain first molar extraction space on the right side
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 2.5 to 3 mm of tooth structure and retracting
CT scan of TMJs and jaws (TMJ Concepts protocol)

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ condylectomy, debridement, reconstruction, and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses
Multiple maxillary osteotomies with bone plate stabilization and hydroxyapatite grafting
Bilateral coronoidectomies
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvested from the abdomen

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
Restorative dentistry to replace the missing maxillary right first molar
B352  MRI Evaluation 

Date of Acquisition:	
Date of Reading:	
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. A little depression in the medial superior aspect of the condyle. Fossa appears to be intact. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat and only comes down less than 2 mm. Appears to be decreased joint space over medially between the condylar head and the medial wall of the fossa. Vertically, joint space looks pretty good. Appears to be some kind of fluid or tissue, perhaps maybe Proplast material, in the fossa area. Actually, roof of the fossa appears to be a little bit rough and not too smooth.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width but a lot of erosion in the condylar head. There is some type of material up in the fossa. Bone in the fossa looks a little bit irregular. There is some soft tissue between the mass in the fossa and the condylar head, and this could be a reactive kind of tissue perhaps. Discal tissue is not readily seen.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with significant flattening and some superior peaking. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Appears to be a lot of fluid in the articular eminence area, and this may have been the white foreign body type of tissue that was present in the coronal views. Articular disc appears to be out lateral and is positioned anteriorly in the fossa. Bone on the articular eminence appears rough. There is anterior beaking on the condyle.

On opening, there is restricted translation, and whatever discal tissue is there appears to be adhesed to the articular eminence. No particular inflammatory process is seen around the joint, however.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is severely deformed. Appears to be heterotopic development off the top of the condyle and large anterior beaking coming forward and flattening on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is relatively flat except at the most medial aspect where it is extremely steep. There are erosions in the articular eminence itself. May be some discal tissue present but severely deformed and degenerated. There are actually erosions on the articular eminence itself. There is very minimal translation of the condyle.

Impression:
Left TMJ severe arthritis and severe degeneration of the articular disc and adhesions of the disc to the articular eminence
Right TMJ severe arthritis with erosions in the condyle and fossa and eminence.

It appears the patient is a very strong candidate for bilateral total joint prostheses.
