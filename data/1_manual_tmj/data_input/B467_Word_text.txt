B467 
B467 is 62 years old and is a self-referral.
In frontal view, B467 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 26 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is -4 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on facial midline and so is the chin. Mandibular dental midline may be about 1 mm off to the left side. In profile view, B467 has a head postured forward neck position. He has pretty good projection of the upper lip but could be maybe 2 to 3 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline appears short. The maxilla may be retruded by 3 to 4 mm. Chin is retruded by about 10 to 12 mm. Intraorally, B467 is missing lower first bicuspids but has the rest of his teeth all the way back to the third molars with crowns on the third molars. Very minimal crowding. He has good attached gingiva with evidence of previous graft being done. Some gingival recession around most of the anterior teeth. In the upper arch, B467 has all of his teeth back through the second molars with crowns on the first and second molars. Basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. He has an anterior deep bite of probably about a 5 mm vertical overbite relationship. B467 has sort of a curtain-type effect from previous LASER to the soft palate. It seems to be bound down almost posteriorly with the soft palate being pulled back towards the posteropharyngeal wall at least on clinical evaluation. Intranasally, there is some evidence of some mucosal bleeding. The septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. Turbinates have been totally excised with virtually no evidence of any inferior turbinate. To palpation, B467 has some mild tenderness over the temporalis, masseter, TMJ and styloid areas. He has problems with his left knee and has arthritis in this neck. He has arthritis in his right TMJ. On opening, he deviates off towards the right side about 4 or 5 mm. The left joint seems to function reasonably smooth. On the right side there is a little bit of a crepitus kind of noise on opening and a soft pop on closing, probably around 20 mm of opening. Maximal incisal opening is 45 mm. Excursive movements are 8 mm in each direction. B467 is not are of clenching or bruxism.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction (right side worse than left side.)
AP maxillary deficiency. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Fibrosed and retracted soft palate.
Decreased transverse width of the posterior faucial pillars.
Severe sleep apnea.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.  
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Maxillary osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Palatoplasty to reconstruct the soft palate and faucial pillars.
Post surgery orthodontics to finish and retain.

B467  MRI Evaluation  
Age: 62/M
Date of Birth:  
Date of Acquisition:  
Date of Interpretation:  

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. The disc may be medially displaced. A little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There is increased superior joint space. There appears to be an osteophyte off the lateral pole of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. The discal tissue appears to be anteriorly and medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. A little flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint but more medially it is in fairly good position indicative of a rotational displacement of the disc. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc reduces and also translates well.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears more sclerotic with decreased vascularization to it. There is a pseudocyst in the posterior aspect of the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc itself is in reasonable condition and appears salvageable. There is a significant amount of fluid in the anterior joint space and actually located anterior to the articular eminence. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc does reduce although the disc itself does not appear to move significantly at all.

IMPRESSION:
1.	Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocated at the lateral aspect of the joint with reduction on opening.
2.	Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction but possible adhesions to the articular eminence.
