B454
B454 is 21 years old. She is referred by Dr. XXXX.
B454's TMJ problems began when she was probably about 12 to 13 years of age when she was aware of having clicking in her joints, but no pain issues. She had orthodontics from about the age of 8 through 17 with about 7 to 8 years total of orthodontic treatment. Her pain issues began about 2 years ago. She has been in a splint for the past two years which she wears at night. She is aware of clenching and bruxing her teeth at nighttime and also sometimes during the day.

B454 rates her headaches at a level of 6 in the frontal and temporal areas bilaterally. She rates her TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 5, diet at 2, and disability at 3. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is allergic to PENICILLIN and has some seasonal allergies. She has no problems wearing jewelry. She takes the following medications:

Doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. Zoloft 50 mg q.d.
Benadryl q.h.s.
Aviane.
In frontal view, B454 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 16 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is zero. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm off to the left side and chin is 3 mm off to the left side. In profile view, the maxilla is probably 4 to 5 mm AP deficient. The mandible is 15 mm AP deficient. The chin neckline is short and chin neckline is moderately defined. Intraorally, B454 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower anterior arch. She has some significant stripping of her gingiva around the central incisors. She probably has at least a third to half of the root exposed. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has a slight accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. She has a Class I end-on occlusion being about 4 mm Class II on the right side and close to 6 mm on the left side. She has an anterior open bite of about 4 mm. She has a cross bite tendency in the second molar areas. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Tonsils are moderately enlarged. Clinically intranasally, the turbinates appear perhaps just mildly enlarged, but at least anteriorly do not create any nasal airway obstruction. She does have a slight head postured forward neck position. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the temporalis, masseters, retromandibular area, and shoulders. On opening, she has a click with deviation of the mandible towards the left side and then back to the right at 20 mm on the left side and 25 mm on the right side and reciprocal closing clicks at about 15 mm on the left side and 20 mm on the right side. The maxillary incisal opening is 51 mm but opening without discomfort 22 mm. The excursion movements are about 8 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a 2 x 2 retainer in the maxillary arch and a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch. Sinuses appear relatively clear. The condyles appear small in size with the left one smaller than the right side. Nasal septum appears relatively straight and turbinates appear relatively normal in size. Sinuses appear relatively clear. There is some significant foreshortening of the roots on the maxillary incisors and mandibular incisors and to a lesser extent the cuspids and bicuspids.

Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The turbinates are moderate in size with the left one being slightly larger than the right one.
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost significant vertical volume. There is decreased lateral joint space. The condyle is fairly flat across the top with a little bit of beaking out laterally and medially. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has more deformation as compared to the opposite side. There is significant loss of vertical volume. There is significantly decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly probably about 4 to 5 mm. On the right side, there is some contouring to the superior surface of the condyle with a medial beaking of the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite small in size anteroposteriorly and with evidence of threatened loss of vertical condylar volume. There is a pseudocyst in the head of the condyle. The articular eminence is moderately shallow.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is small in size, although not quite as small as the opposite side. There is anterior beaking present. There is significant loss of vertical volume. The articular eminence has a mild to moderate inclination. There is an increased posterior joint space in both joints related likely to forward posturing of the mandible.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she does have a forward postured mandible and not in centric relation. She has an anterior open bite of about 4 mm. Her oropharyngeal airway is about 5 mm at the soft palate level and probably 8 mm at the base of the tongue.

B454 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1.5 mm.
Basic diagnoses for B454 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ adolescent internal condylar resorption (AICR) and in an advanced state. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical as well as transverse hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Class II occlusion.
Anterior open bite of 4 mm. High occlusal plane angle facial morphology.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Short roots on the maxillary and mandibular incisors.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics: Align and level maxillary arch, but place a step in the arch wire to align the four incisors in an elevated plane compared to the cuspids and posterior teeth. Very carefully tip lateral incisors roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make a little bit more room for interdental osteotomies which will be necessary.
2.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction.
3.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

DOB: 
DATE OF ACQUISITION:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite small in size with evidence of condylar resorption. There appears to be a cyst in the medial aspect of the condyle. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 or 3 mm. Difficult to identify discal tissue, but may be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost vertical volume. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Discal tissue appears to be anterior and laterally displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost vertical volume. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is foreshortened and somewhat degenerated. There is some significant fluid anterior to the condyle and directly beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there is a moderately good translation but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic and has loss of vertical volume. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is foreshortened and degenerated. There is significant fluid beneath the articular eminence and out lateral to the condylar neck. On opening, there is moderate good translation of the condyle, but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs anteriorly displaced without reduction with significant degenerative changes.
