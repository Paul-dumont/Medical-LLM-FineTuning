B476 
B476  is 45 years old. Referred by XX.

B476 's TMJ problems began in approximately 18 years ago. Prior to that, she was in an MVA 20 years ago. In younger times in her life when she was a teenager, she was struck in the face with a baseball that broke her nose and maybe caused a crack in her sphenoid bone. She was a big-time roller skater including falls where she would hit the floor and strike the back of her head. Last year, she developed a right-sided Bell's palsy. When she was 6 months old, she fell off a counter striking the right side of her head and sustained a fractured skull. Her headaches have been fairly severe since at least 16 years ago. She has some significant hormonal problems involving endometriosis and had a hysterectomy 16 years ago and an oophorectomy in 15 years ago. To manage her jaw and headache problems, she has gone through the following treatments:
1. Chiropractic treatment since 16 years ago and currently still receiving that treatment. 2. Massage therapy since 16 years ago to current. 3. Splint therapy since 15 years ago by four different doctors. 4. Neurocranial reconstruction including nine series.
5. Evaluation at the New England Center for Headaches in approximately 10 years ago where she was given a number of medications and injections that did not help.
6. Evaluation by a neurologist who was giving her Botox injections about every 4-6 months in the head and shoulder areas for approximately 6 years.
7. Physical therapy including such treatments as ultrasound, TENS, etc.
8. Acupuncture.
9. Equilibration x3.

None of these treatments have been able to curb or eliminate her severe headache problem.
B476 gets headaches that occur daily at an average level of 9 in the frontotemporal and posterior head and frequently escalate to 10. Her headaches are worse in the mornings and may get a little bit better in the afternoon, but then get worse again at night. She rates her average daily TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 7, diet at 2, disability at 6. She takes the following medications currently:
1. Esterase 2 mg daily. 2. Estratest HS. 3. Lunesta occasionally. 4. Vicodin one-half tablet occasionally as she is afraid to take narcotics.

She has had trouble with earaches, has mild tinnitus, but no vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her knees and her hips. She likely does clench at night, although she is not aware of it. She does not feel that she clenches during the day. She has a significant problem sleeping at night. She has moderate daytime somnolence likely due to lack of sleep.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
: B476 has fairly good left-to-right facial asymmetry, although she has increased fullness on the right side of the face. This could be a residual from the Bell's palsy. She might have just some slight increased fullness of the masseter muscle on the right side compared to the left side, although both muscles are fairly strong when she does clench. The right side may be just a little bit more prominent. In profile, B476 has good facial balance. Intraorally, B476 is missing lower first bicuspids due to previous orthodontics as well as in the upper arch she is missing first bicuspids. She has a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side, but a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the left side by probably about 4 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. Lower dental midline is about almost 3 mm off towards to the left side, but is also off to the left side of the chin which is fairly well aligned. The soft palate and faucial pillars look relatively normal and tissues look healthy. Tonsils have previously been removed. Intranasally, turbinates are moderately enlarged, but she does have a passable airway. She also gives a history of being able to breathe through her nose without much difficulty even at night unless she gets a cold or gets stopped up. On palpation around the head and neck, she has moderate pain over the SCMs, posterior neck, TMJ areas, and left medial pterygoid. She has moderate tenderness over the masseters and styloid areas. On putting pressure on the TMJs she would feel pain behind her eyes. On opening, B476 has almost immediate click in the left joint at about 10 mm and closing click probably about 5. On the right side, felt the click maybe just slightly later about 15 mm of opening and probably about 5 or 10 mm at closing. Maximum size opening is about 55 mm. Excursion rims are about 8 mm in each direction. On excursion movements, there is definite popping noises in the left TMJ.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all fourth and third molars and all four first bicuspids. Sinuses look relatively clear. Left condyle looks a little flattened on the anterior aspect, a little bit pointed superiorly, but right side looks a little bit more normal with just some mild flattening. Waters view shows that the bony septums are reasonably straight, but the turbinate septal on the right side is enlarged. Sinuses look relatively clear. She has some slight increased bony prominence of the mandible on the right side compared to the left side, but not real significant. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is relatively short in vertical length, although moderately steep. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and superiorly. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is a little bit longer in length and moderately steep. On opening, there is relatively good translation of both condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B476 has good facial balance vertically and anteroposteriorly. Oropharyngeal airway looks very good.

The diagnoses for B476 would be as follows:
1. Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reductions. 2. Relative mandibular hyperplasia. 3. Severe headaches. 4. Severe TMJ pain. 5. Myofascial pain. 6. Missing all four first bicuspids and all four third molars. 7. Class I occlusion on the right side, Class II end-on on the left side.
8. Mandibular midline shifted about 3 mm to the left of the facial midline, maxillary down the midline, and chin midline.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Application of brackets to maxillary and mandibular arches. 2. Surgery. a. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies with bone plate stabilization. c. Placement of arch bars if patient elects not to have orthodontic appliances placed. 3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine and retain occlusion.

B476 MRI EVALUATION  
AGE: 45/F
DOB: 
Date of Acquisition:  
Date of Interpretation:  
Left TMJ coronal view, Condyle appears fairly normal. It appears there may be discal tissue displaced laterally.

Left TMJ sagittal shows slight anterior beaking. It appears to be sitting along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence. The articular eminence is fairly steep. This is more prominent towards the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc and the disc is in a reduced position.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width and fairly good opening on the lateral aspect. Disc appears to be medially displaced and covers about a little more than half of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa occurs inferiorly about at least 3 mm.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit flattened on the anterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Disc may be anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint, but more medially it appears to be in a better position. However, the disc is not very well seen on the medial side of the joint. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc with the disc in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and laterally dislocated, but with reduction. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint.
