B396 MRI Evaluation 
Age: 23-year-old female
Date of Birth: 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 

Axial views show that the left condyle has good morphology with what appears to be good anteroposterior and mediolateral dimension.
Right TMJ axial view has good morphology with what appears to be good anteroposterior and mediolateral dimension.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. The cortex is intact around the top of the condyle. The condyle has a nice rounded top on it. The fossa has good morphology. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. Difficult to identify discal tissue although there is some evidence of perhaps a laterally displaced disc. The joint space seems fairly well balanced although could be less than normal adequate space for the disc.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of a different shape with a somewhat inferior position of the lateral aspect of the condylar head compared to the medial side. There is perhaps some decreased vertical joint space and a little bit more decreased towards the medial side compared to the lateral side. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. Cortex is intact at both the fossa and on the condyle. There may be some evidence of discal tissue laterally displaced in this joint.

Left TMJ sagittal view demonstrates that out laterally the articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. There is some decreased posterior joint space. There is some osteophytic buildup within the fossa along the superior and posterior aspect. When medial, the disc is very difficult to identify. Towards the lateral aspect there appears to be discal tissue balled up at the lateral aspect indicative of possible lateral and anterior dislocation this articular disc. In the mid portion of the joint, the disc of what can be seen appears to be in a more normal position. The articular eminence is moderately steep but not very long in length. There may be some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the articular disc is reduced and translate well with the condyle. There is a little bit of flattening on the anterior head.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is flattened on the anterior head and towards the lateral aspect there is an area where the cortical bone appears less identifiable. Articular eminence is moderately steep but not very long in length. Towards the medial side the disc is not as readily seen. In the mid part of the joint the disc appears to be in better position. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc may be anteriorly and laterally displaced. At the lateral aspect of the condyle there appears to be a mass of discal tissue anterior to it. There could be a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc with evidence of significant flattening of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anterior and laterally displaced. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and laterally displaced.

B396 
B396 is 23 years old, referred by Dr.  . She has had previous surgery for a dislocated elbow.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Severe TMJ pain. Headaches. Pain through the jaws. Difficulty eating and chewing. Teeth do not line up properly. CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Birth control pills. Aleve for pain. Nasonex. Claritin. B396 gets frequent earaches and occasional tinnitus and vertigo but has no hearing loss. The only other joints that really bother her are her knees. She is aware of clenching at nighttime.

B396 began having headaches at about the age of 10. She became aware of clicking and popping in her jaw joints about 4 years ago of unknown etiology. She has had equilibrations done on her teeth several times and she has had approximately 8 splints constructed. She apparently has been wearing splints since 8 years ago and one of her doctors told her they had been working since 8 years ago on her TMJ problems.

She gets headaches about 5 days per week at a level of 5 and they occur predominately in the right temple area and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 9, average daily pain at 7, jaw function at 5, diet at 9, disability at 8. The actual treatment that began 8 years ago was for a soft dental appliance to keep her from clenching when she played sports. She began complaining of headaches 4 years ago. 3 years ago, her jaws began locking. 2 years ago, her pain problems were increasing. Last year, she was in extreme pain. Along the way she must have had some equilibrations done.

In frontal view, B396 has very good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 2 to 3 mm. Maxillary midline, mandibular dental midline and chin midlines are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, B396 has good facial balance. She has a C-shaped curve to the upper lip. The lower lip is a little bit everted and chin is slightly retruded. Chin neckline and chin-neck angle are fairly well defined. Intraorally B396 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. The lower arch is somewhat constricted. She has a little bit of spacing around her lower anterior teeth. In the upper jaw she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. B396 is fairly close to having a Class I cuspid relationship but she has an end-on incisor relationship in part due to the spacing that is opened between her lower anterior teeth. The upper lateral incisors may be a little bit small in size. She appears to have adequate attached gingiva. 

She probably has at least 2 mm of spacing in the lower arch. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. The uvula and soft palate are relatively normal and faucial pillars are mildly constricted. Intranasally the septum appears relatively straight and turbinates appear moderate in size. She reports no problems with snoring or sleep apnea but does have some mild daytime somnolence that she relates to being a college student. B396 will be graduating in about 2 weeks. To palpation she has some rather severe pain over the TMJs and styloid areas. High moderate pain over the shoulders, moderate pain over the masseters, SCMs and milder pain over the medial pterygoids. On opening, she seems to function smoothly but on closing has crepitus in the left joint. She says that this alternates from side-to-side and at other times it will be on the right side but it seems to be more prevalent on the left. B396's maximum incisal opening is 50 mm but only about 17 mm without pain. She can go into excursive movements to about 10 mm in each direction. She had her wisdom teeth removed in about 6 years ago.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars but the rest of the teeth are all present and appear to be in very good condition. It is difficult to evaluate the sinuses. The condyles may appear a little bit flattened anteriorly but difficult to assess.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear healthy and clear. The septum is fairly straight. The turbinates are of moderate size. Some decreased airway perhaps on the left side compared to the right side.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There appears to be an increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.

Right TMJ tomogram also shows a condyle posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. The top of the condyle appears somewhat sclerotic. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is basically a skeletal Class I relationship and basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship although she has an end-on incisor relationship. Oropharyngeal airway appears adequate. Bolton's analysis reveals no tooth size discrepancy.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction and possible perforation.
Mandibular hyperplasia.
Slight Class III end-on occlusion.
Spacing in lower anterior arch.
End-on incisor relationship.
Severe TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Masticatory dysfunction.
 

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to correct the occlusion.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
