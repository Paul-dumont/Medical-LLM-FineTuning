B317 
B317 is 52 years old, referred by Dr. __. B317 has had problems with kidney stones in the past. Otherwise, B317 is in good health with no major medical problems. B317 's problems started she believes probably around 5 to 6 years ago of unknown etiology. She does report being in a very severe motor vehicle accident around 23 years ago or 22 years ago where she received facial trauma and her front teeth were knocked out and she was also unconscious and was almost left for dead until someone who knew her drove by, identified the car, saw her laying in a puddle of water, turned her over and found out she was still alive. She has had no treatment for her current condition except for extensive dental work. She takes no medications except vitamins and calcium.

PRIMARY CONCERNS
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Joint noises.
Pain in the jaw, face and neck area. Headaches.
Pain in the mornings when she wakes up.
Bite is off.
Mouth breather day and night. Jaws getting very tired.
Severe drooling problems.

She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus or hearing loss but does get occasional vertigo. No other joints bother her. She does have allergies to wool and cats. She is not aware of any problems wearing jewelry. She is aware that she probably does clench at night. She rates her headaches at a level of 4 in the temporal and posterior head area that occur about once a week. She gets what she classifies as mild headaches about 3 times a week that she wakes up in the morning which is indicative of nocturnal clenching. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 4, jaw function at 5, diet at 4 and disability at 2. B317 does feel that her bite has gotten worse during the past 5 to 6 years.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B317 has fairly good left to right symmetry in reference to upper and lower jaw. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 6 mm. Maxillary dental midline is 1 mm off to the left. Mandibular dental midline is 1 mm off to the right. The chin is off to the right probably about 2 to 3 mm. The nasal tip is off to the right side by about 3 mm. In the profile view, the maxilla is probably 6 to 8 mm AP retruded. She is about 20 to 25 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline is almost nonexistent. The genial tubercles are probably only about 1 cm to 1.5 cm in front of the trachea. B317 does have a head postured forward neck position. The lower third face is elongated. She has lip incompetence of approximately 10 mm. Intraorally, B317 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. She has a crown on the left first and second molars. She has significant crowding in the lower anterior arch. Left cuspid is about 3 mm anterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, she has extensive bridge work which will be identified in the Panorex representing all of the other teeth back through the second molars. B317 

She has a full Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and a Class I cuspid on the left side. She has an anterior overbite of 2 mm. She has an overjet of about 2 mm. Upper bridgework in the front shows no crowns transversely but also they are thick. Maxillary mandibular arches are narrow transversely. The uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all look relatively healthy and the tissues look healthy. The faucial pillars are moderately constricted but not too significant. B317 has narrow nostrils. The right nostril is a little bit more narrow than the left side. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum deviates at the superior aspect a little bit off to the right side but significantly off to the left side. There appears to be some decreased airway there. The luminal valves are quite constricted. Holding the luminal valves open with a nasal scope significantly improved her abilities to breathe through her nose. To palpation, B317 has some mild tenderness over the masseter muscles, styloid areas and mild tenderness over the TMJs. On opening, she does have fairly good mobility but does have some crepitus sounds in the joints. Maximal incisal opening is 47 mm. Excursive movements are about 10 mm in each direction. There is some significant crepitus on her jaw movements.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. She is also missing maxillary left central and lateral incisors. She has lost alveolar bone in that maxillary area. She has root canals on maxillary left central incisor, first bicuspid, first and second molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. She also appears to have a crown on the mandibular left second bicuspid. The condyles appear severely arthritic. The sinuses dip way down around the roots particularly on the left side slightly more than on the right side.

Waters view shows severe deviation and enlarged nasal spur extending off the left side of the septum. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The nasal airway appears to have fairly significant occlusion present. The sinuses otherwise appear fairly clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows severe arthritis present with sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Decreased superior joint space. Posterior joint space looks relatively normal. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be increased joint space anteriorly. The condyle appears small compared to the size of the fossa.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears significantly arthritic and appears to actually be shorter in vertical height as compared to the left side. The condyle is small in size particularly compared to the size of the fossa. There could be some calcification sitting posterior to the condylar head as there appears to be some osteophyte structure there extending into the fossa area and in close approximation to the posterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle appears small compared to the size of the fossa. She has a high mandibular plane angle, occlusal plane angle shape. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyles where the condyles come down towards the articular eminence but not quite completely underneath.

B317 
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B317 has a retruded maxilla and severely retruded mandible. Skeletal Class II relationship is present with a significantly high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway is constricted with an airway dimension at the soft palate level about 3 mm and at the base of the tongue it is difficult to say because there may have been some movement there but may be around 5 mm. She demonstrates significant lip incompetence. She has a slightly reverse curve in the cervical vertebrae. Some of the cervical joint space in C6 appears to be decreased in vertical dimensions compared to the vertebrae further superior.

BASIC DIAGNOSES
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular dislocation with severe deformation. Severe AP mandibular deficiency.
AP maxillary deficiency. Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Class II cuspid relationship on the right side but Class I on the left.
Steep occlusal plane angle. Decreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 to 4 mm (normal 11 mm.)
Small constricted nostrils. Hypertrophied turbinates.
Deviated nasal septum with a large septal spur extending into the left side.
Nasal airway obstruction.
Missing maxillary right central and lateral incisors replaced with a bridge.
Excessively long vertical crown length on the incisors.
Significant tooth size discrepancy but if occlusion remains in a Class II position on the right side, Class I on the left it would not be a significant treatment factor.
Moderate crowding of lower anterior arch.
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain.
Nocturnal clenching.
Predominant mouth breather.
Masticatory dysfunction.
Nasal asymmetry with the tip deviated about 3 to 4 mm off to the right side (the patient is not interested in having this corrected at this time.)
Sleep apnea symptoms. Lower arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being approximately 4 mm anterior to the right cuspid. B317 

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip the lower anterior teeth removing 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them forward. Dental preparation of decreasing the vertical height of the clinical crowns on the 4 incisors to meet the post-treatment specifications for vertical crown length.
CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla approximately 8 to 10 mm and down graft the posterior aspect down approximately 4 mm to level the occlusal plane angle.
Bilateral TMJ coronoidectomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Partial turbinectomies.
Nasoseptoplasty.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Periodontal treatment to reconstruct the alveolar ridge, graft the maxillary right cuspid, and place osseointegrated implants. Dental reconstruction to rebuild the arches and finalize the occlusion.

B317  MRI Evaluation
Age: 52
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows significant loss of condylar volume. The condyle is quite narrow mediolaterally and a tremendous vertical decrease in dimension. There is some discal tissue medially and anterior to the remaining condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa is extremely flat.

Right TMJ likewise shows a condyle that is extremely narrow mediolaterally and has lost significant vertical dimension. The lateral rim of the fossa has minimal downward curvature but just slightly more than the opposite side. There appears to be discal tissue medial and anterior to the condyle. There is decreased signal to both condyles.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost volume but it actually looks better in the sagittal view as compared to the coronal view. There is significantly decreased joint space superiorly although the posterior joint space is okay. Articular eminence is quite steep. The condyle appears small compared to the size of the fossa. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced sitting beneath the articular eminence and extremely short anteroposteriorly. The disc has a little bit better confirmation towards the medial side of the joint. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint it is more difficult to see the disc. This may be indicative of anteromedial displacement. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view likewise shows a condyle that appears a little bit small compared to the size of the fossa. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is decreased signal in the condylar head. Disc is significantly deformed. The condyle appears significantly degenerated. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocations without reductions, significant deformation of the articular discs.
Questionable salvageability of the articular discs.
