B369 
B369 is 26 years old and is referred by Dr. _. She was born with choanal atresia that was repaired 23 years ago. She has suffered depression since last year in relation to her constant pain problems. She had myringotomy tubes placed and a tonsillectomy. She had her wisdom teeth removed 7 years ago. B369 is in very good health except for the jaw problem.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lexapro 2.5 mg every other day.
Percocet 10 mg p.r.n. for severe pain.
Diazepam, used when necessary to help her sleep.
Naproxen b.i.d.
Ibuprofen 1 to 2 tablets p.r.n. Prednisone 10 mg daily, a 10-tablet protocol which she starts at a 100 dose and then tapers downward.

B369's problems relative to her TMJs began when she was about 15 or 16 years old of unknown etiology. She noticed clicking and popping in her joints at that time. She had orthodontics from the age of 11 to 13. She has had multiple splints made over the years but many of these tended to make her clench more increasing her problems. She has had chiropractic treatment and this has helped her at least temporarily. She again had a splint made , by Dr. _ and this has provided some relief for her. That splint now is being managed and adjusted by Dr. _. In addition, she has had physical therapy which among other things included ultrasound and moist heat. She is getting some physical therapy or chiropractic treatment on her vertebrae particularly in her neck and shoulder areas. She has had counseling for anxiety and depression.

B369 gets headaches at about a level of 7 throughout most of the head area. These occur several times per week. Her pain involving her ears is worse than her headaches. She rates her TMJ pain at 10, average daily pain at 7, jaw function, diet and disability at 9. She gets frequent earaches, tinnitus and occasional vertigo. She thinks she may have a little bit of hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her left knee which developed about 2 years ago and also she feels she has some neck problems also. She has had an adverse reaction to Wellbutrin. She also has trouble wearing jewelry particularly cheap earrings. She is aware of clenching at night when she sleeps.

The patient states that her pain is worse in the morning when she wakes up. This is likely due to clenching and bruxism.
B369 had clicking and popping continuously in her joints up until . That is when she developed the closed lock situation. She has not had clicking or popping in her joints since that time and has not been able to open her mouth since that time. Dr. _ apparently attempted to open her jaw and some very loud pops were heard. Dr. _ saw B369  and had her open her jaws as much as she possibly could after he did some novocaine injections into the joint. She was able to open wider after that but in the process she heard a very loud pop occur.

B369 
In frontal view, B369 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 17 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 3 mm. Maxillary, mandibular and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. Nasal tip may be just slightly off to the left side 1 to 2 mm. In profile, she has fairly good balance vertically and AP-wise. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. In the upper arch, B369 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. On the right side, her teeth appear to be open from back through the second molar. Oropharynx looks good and uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all look relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum is deviated off to the right side. Left turbinate is quite large and right turbinate is more moderate but there appears to be a decreased nasal airway on the right side. The left side is somewhat decreased because of the large turbinate on that side but there does appear to be a passable airway more so on the left. To palpation she has moderate pain over the left TMJ and milder pain over the temporalis, masseters and shoulder areas. On function, she has limited opening and the joints seem reasonably smooth though she could hear a little crepitation in the left joint. She says that when she wears her bite splint at night she wakes up and her lower is postured forward and she actually feels better for awhile until the jaw settles back into position. Maximal incisal opening is 30 mm but she can only open about 10 mm without significant discomfort. Excursive movements are about 6 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars but the rest of the teeth are all present. Sinuses appear relatively clear as best as can be seen here. The septum is deviated significantly off to the right side. Difficult to evaluate the joints.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Septum appears a little bit straighter in these views although there is some shifting a little bit in the bony area but the cartilaginous area is not seen.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that seems to have relatively good size with a little hockey stick shape to it. There appears to be decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence appears moderately steep.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have maybe a little flattening on the superior aspect. There appears to be significantly decreased joint space vertically. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There may be slight decreased posterior joint space as well. On opening, there is some translation but restricted opening. Condyles fall short of the articular eminence.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has basically a skeletal Class I jaw and occlusal relationship. Maxilla and mandible is slightly rotated backwards. Oropharyngeal airway is probably pretty much normal with the tongue in a normal vertical position. Occlusal plane angle is moderately high.

B369 
BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations that are nonreducing and with significant degenerative changes.
Severe TMJ pain.
Severe headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Bilateral TMJ closed lock situation.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications.
Klonopin 1 mg tablets dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s.
Bactrim 800/160 mg dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet b.i.d., refill x1.
Rifampin 300 mg tablets dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet b.i.d., refill x1.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery option 1.
Bilateral disc repositioning with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies.
Surgery option 2.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with total joint prostheses. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B369 is to call me in 2 weeks to let me know how she is doing with medications. She is to begin the Klonopin for 1 week prior to using the antibiotics to monitor the improvement she gains just from that. These results of the medications will have a bearing on which treatment option will work best for her.

B369  Evaluation Age: 25/F
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically. It appears that there could be discal tissue displaced laterally. However, it appears there may be some discal tissue anterior as well. Cortical bone across the top seems to be intact although there could be a little bit of unevenness across the top. Lateral rim of the fossa is relatively flat. The lateral pole of the condyle extends well beyond the lateral rim of the fossa in some areas by probably 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears quite large. In fact, it appears a bit larger than the opposite side. There is a decreased superior joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly to a greater extent on this side as compared to the opposite side. It appears that the discal tissue is probably anteriorly displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact. The lateral pole of the condyle extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that may be a little bit narrow anteroposteriorly compared to the size of the fossa. Articular eminence is quite long and fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and maybe somewhat deformed. There is some significant fluid in joint space. Some parts are sitting beneath the articular eminence and some in the superior aspect of the joint. The condyle has a little bit of a hockey stick shape to it. A little bit of sclerosis around the head of the condyle. On opening, there is limited translation of the condyle with it just basically approaching the articular eminence. Disc is anteriorly displaced and nonreducing. This appears somewhat deformed.

Right TMJ sagittal shows a condyle that appears a little bit larger than the opposite side. It appears to have a hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is steep in some areas as compared to the opposite side. It appears there may be a little bit of a decreased joint space vertically. The disc is anteriorly positioned and actually is in sort of a vertical inclination along the posterior slope of the articular eminence. It could be that the disc is in a position where it is displaced but upon opening it may not evidence clicking or popping. No significant fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is restriction of translation and the disc may reduce. The disc itself does not appear to translate.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with it opening with some reduction of the disc.
