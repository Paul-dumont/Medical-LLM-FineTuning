B212
B212 is 20 years old, referred by XXXX. She has arthrochondritis in her left ankle. She had ankle surgery to take a bone graft from her kneecap to place into her ankle where she had a deficit that developed there. Otherwise, she is in good health. B212 believes her TMJ problems began about 10 years ago in a motor vehicle accident. She was riding in the back seat with her hands and jaw behind the front seat and they ran into a car and her lower jaw got pushed back. After that, her jaws began to crackle. She did have a soft bite plate at one time and she also has been through orthodontics. She says her jaw joint locks about one time per week but sometimes more often.

PRIMARY CONCERNS
1. Jaw cracks and pops.
2. Jaw locks.
3. Headaches.
4. Jaw pain.
She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus or hearing loss but does get occasional vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, fingers, knees and ankles. She has no known allergies. She has no difficulty wearing cheap jewelry. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She says she gets headaches about 1 time per week at a level of 5 in the frontal, temple and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 6, overall average facial daily pain at 6 with pain frequently in the masseter muscle areas. She rates her TMJ function at 2, diet at 5, disability at 0.

In frontal view, B212 has very good facial symmetry and balance. She has a good Class I cuspid molar relationship. She has a little bit of an overjet of maybe 1 mm. In profile, she has also excellent facial balance. B212 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars and all of her upper teeth back through the second molars. She has a very good bite relationship. Intraorally, she has her tonsils and they are moderately enlarged. She reports she gets an occasional sore throat. Otherwise, the soft palate, uvula, faucial pillars etc. all look relatively normal. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseters, TMJ, styloid areas and SCMs. On opening, she has audible opening clicks in both joints that are approximately 10 to 15 mm of opening and closing about 10 to 5 mm. Maximal incisal opening is 57 mm but only about 35 mm without discomfort. Excursive movement to the right about 11 mm, to the left about 9.5 mm. B212 does report that she does get locking in her jaw particularly if she shifts off to one side or sometimes when she is singing it gets locked in an open position and she has to manipulate it in order to get her jaws closed.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex view shows all 4 third molars are absent but the rest of the teeth are present. I believe there is only 1 restoration that I could see on imaging. The sinuses look relatively clear. Nasal airway looks reasonably clear. The condyles appear fairly healthy with just a little bit of flattening on the anterior head.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear clear and the septum appears fairly straight. Jaw structures appear symmetric.
Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have reasonable morphology with a little bit of flattening on the anterior head perhaps. Decreased superoposterior joint space. Articular eminence is relatively steep. It appears there is a slight increased joint space. Open TMJ films show good translation of both condyles well beyond the articular eminences.

Lateral cephalogram shows good skeletal Class I cuspid molar relationship. Little difference in vertical at the occlusal plane. Oropharyngeal airway looks adequate.

Left TMJ tomogram shows the condyle that has fairly good morphology but fills most of the space. There is a little flattening at the anterior head of the condyle. Decreased superior and posterior joint space.

BASIC DIAGNOSES
1. Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with early reduction.
2. Relative mandibular hyperplasia.
3. TMJ pain.
4. Myofascial pain.
5. Headaches.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Apply braces to the maxillary arch. b. Apply braces to the mandibular arch.
2. Surgery. a. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain current occlusion but create space to accommodate the articular discs.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

MRI Evaluation
Age: 20
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears fairly large mediolaterally. The lateral pole of the condyle extends just slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Decreased superior joint space is present. There could be a little bit of discal tissue displaced lateral to the joint. Cortical bone appears to be intact. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount probably about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The lateral pole of the condyle extends out towards the lateral extent of the rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount probably 3 mm. Decreased superior joint space is present with possible lateral anterior displacement of the articular disc.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Some flattening on the anterior head and some sclerosis and almost an osteophyte kind of formation on the superior head of the condyle. Significant flattening on the anterior head as we approach the medial side of the joint. Articular eminence is fairly steep and somewhat elongated. The disc is anteriorly displaced and it appears to be laterally displaced as well. No open views are available.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is flattened anteriorly. Articular is fairly steep. It does appear to be as elongated as the opposite side. The disc is anteriorly displaced and there is a decreased superior joint space. The disc also appears to be laterally displaced. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. There appears to be a little bit of an osteophyte on top of the condyle.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation with probable early reduction.
2. Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation with probable early reduction.
