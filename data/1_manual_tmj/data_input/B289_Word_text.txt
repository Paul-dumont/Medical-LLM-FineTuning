B289 
B289 is 13 years old, referred by Dr. __. B289 is in good health. She has been diagnosed with ADD and takes Adderall 20 mg daily. The parents have been aware that B289 has had a jaw alignment problem almost since birth. At the age of 4 B289 was first taken to Dr. __ for evaluation. She subsequently had a maxillary expander and retainers placed. In approximately 2 years ago, braces were placed and she has had them on for about 2 years now. She has had no other treatments.

BASIC CONCERNS:
Jaws are not straight.
Jaws and teeth are not lined up properly. Cannot chew straight or talk very clearly. Facial structures are asymmetric. Popping in the left jaw joint.
Pain and discomfort in the left jaw particularly when chewing.

She would like to the abilities to:
Talk better.
Chew correctly.
Help her self confidence and esthetics.
Keep kids from teasing her.
In frontal view, B289 has fairly good balance between the middle and upper length. It is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about -1. Left eye is about 2 mm lower than the right eye. Maxillary midline is about 2 mm off to the left. Mandibular dental midline is almost 7 mm off to the left of the maxillary dental midline but 9 mm to the left of the facial midline. Chin is approximately 15 mm off to the left side. Inferior border of the mandible on the left side is about 10 mm higher than the inferior border on the right side. The right side of the face in the mandibular angle area is probably 6 mm more prominent than the left side. In profile view, the maxilla is probably about 3 mm AP deficient and the mandible is about 18 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline is extremely short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. There is some significant fullness in the submental area. Intraorally, B289 is missing mandibular left first bicuspid and mandibular right first bicuspid. In the upper arch she is also missing first bicuspids bilaterally. She has a Class III end-on cuspid relationship on the right side by probably 4 to 5 mm and is a full Class II cuspid relationship on the left side. B289 has about a 1.5 mm vertical overbite relationship. She appears to have adequate attached gingiva around her teeth. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are actually fairly well aligned with each other. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being about 4 mm higher than the right side. There is some lower arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being 45 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, the left cuspid is probably 1 mm posterior to the right cuspid. Maximal incisal opening is 45 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 4 mm, to the left 5 mm. She has a crossbite in the left posterior side.

B289 
Around her left ear she has malformed tragal cartilage. She has a small ear tag. On the right side she has a skin alteration in her ear area that is probably about 1 cm x 6 or 7 mm. She may have a small rudimentary ear tag about 1 cm anterior to the inferior part of her ear. Oropharyngeal areas look relatively normal. Uvula and soft palate appears normal but the faucial pillars do appear moderately constricted. Intranasally, the septum maybe deviated a little bit off towards the right side. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The columella appears somewhat wide and the nostrils appear a little bit narrow with the left nostril being a little bit smaller than the right side. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. B289 rates her TMJ pain at 3 when chewing, average daily pain at 1, jaw function and diet at 3 and disability at 1. She gets headaches about 2 times a month in the frontal area that she registers at about a level of 5. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Apparently her speech is affected with the jaw problem.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of developing 4 third molars. All 4 first bicuspids are absent. The left side of the mandible is significantly underdeveloped and the condyles and ramus are very small in size compared to the opposite side. The sinuses appear clear. Left fossa appears deformed.

Waters view shows the significant transverse asymmetry. Maxillary midline is 2 mm off to the left and mandibular dental midline appears almost 1 cm off to the left and the chin is probably a good 15 mm off towards the left side. Sinuses are surprisingly relatively equal in size. The sinuses for the most part appear relatively clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology. There appears to be decreased superior and posteriorly joint spaces. There is a little bit of flattening at the superior head of the condyle.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a rudimentary condyle extremely underdeveloped and ramus as well as posterior body of the mandible. This is compatible with hemifacial microsomia. On opening, there is good translation of the right TMJ but relatively minimal translation on the left side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is significant vertical asymmetry at the left inferior border about 10 to 12 mm higher than the right side at the angle area. There is a definite vertical discrepancy in the occlusal plane. The maxilla appears AP deficient and the mandible appears to be significantly AP deficient. Oropharyngeal airway is constricted with the airway at the soft palate level of only 5 mm and at the base of the tongue it is better about 8 mm. Some adenoid tissue in the nasopharynx still remaining. Joints seem to function relatively smoothing in opening and in excursive movements. There is a slight tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1 mm. There is a yaw to the bite relationship with the right side of the maxilla being at least 2 mm to the right and mandible 3 mm to the right.

B289 
BASIC DIAGNOSES: Hemifacial microsomia on the left side.
Severely deformed left jaw joint.
Severe hypoplasia of mandibular left ramus, condyle and body.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Severe mandibular asymmetry with the chin shifted 15 mm off to the left side.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Major posterior vertical maxillary deficiency with the left side worse than the right side.
Transverse maxillary deficiency.
Class III end-on cuspid relationship on the right side, full Class II cuspid relationship on the left side. Left posterior crossbite. Missing all 4 first bicuspids secondary to previous extractions. Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x4. High occlusal plane angulation being worse on the left side as compared to the right side. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 4 mm higher than the right side. Soft tissue asymmetry with the left commissure 4 to 5 mm higher than the right commissure.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Extract maxillary and mandibular third molars x4.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Tip maxillary left lateral incisor root mesially and cuspid root distally to make room for an interdental osteotomy. The right side is okay.
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Left mandibular and TMJ reconstruction as well as mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Right mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomy.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it, level the transverse occlusal plane, and down graft the posterior aspect to decrease the occlusal plane.
Left TMJ fat graft (harvest from the abdomen.)
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Reassess for any residual facial asymmetry.
Surgery stage 2 only if indicated. Facial augmentations or fat grafting to improve facial symmetry.

Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a joint that is simply malformed. Difficult to actually identify any normalcy of the fossa. The condyle is quite narrow mediolaterally. There appears to be virtually no vertical joint space. Condyle appears to be narrow anteroposteriorly on this particular film.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a fossa has a little bit of joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm. The medial pole of the condyle is at 5 to 10 mm higher than the lateral pole.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite small anteroposteriorly and appears to be short vertically. The fossa is extremely flat and positioned very low relative to the external meatus. Virtually no articular eminence is present. There does appear to be discal tissue, however, between the condyle and the fossa component. The mandible appears to be postured forward. There could be a little inflammation posterior to the condyle but difficult to tell. On opening, there appears to be some kind of mass posterior to the condyle. It appears there may be a calcified mass towards the medial side of the joint. This has the condyle displaced anteriorly. There does not appear to be any significant translation although the condyle itself is postured forward beneath the articular eminence. The condyle appears quite small.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There appears to be osteophytic developments superior on the condyle in the mid portion of it with virtually no joint space between the condyle and fossa. There appears to be some rudiment of discal tissue in the joint area. On the T2 films, there is some fluid in the joint space and there does appear to be some discal tissue. On the opening views, there is fairly good translation. The articular eminence is relatively shallow on this side as well but not as shallow as the opposite side. In some areas it appears as though there could be bone-on-bone articulation but it is difficult to tell.

IMPRESSION: Severely deformed fossa and condyle on the left side with what appears to be a calcified mass posterior to the condyle. Right TMJ arthritis with an articular disc that may be displaced but difficult to interpret.
