B261 
B261 is currently 60 years old. I performed previous surgery on her 13 years ago, so she is 12 years 10 months postsurgery. Four years ago, she fell and struck the left side of her jaw. She was aware of her bite changing at that time. Last year, she fell and struck her forehead. She has broken some of the teeth with both of these falls. She is aware of nocturnal clenching. She has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. She has no problems with headaches, but rates her TMJ pain at an average level of about 5, but it can easily escalate to 8. Average daily pain usually reaches about an 8. Jaw function is at 0, diet at 2, and disability at 0. She takes the following medications:
Levothyroxine.
Detrol LA (for her bladder).
Estrace 0.5 mg per day.
Zestoretic (for blood pressure and diuretic).
Asacol.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B261 has fairly good facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 1 mm. Maxillary dental midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted about 3 mm off to the right. She has a left posterior overbite. She has a Class III end-on occlusion on the left side and a slight Class II cuspid relationship on the right side. B261 is in splint therapy now. She is predominantly on her front teeth and her back teeth do not touch, particularly on the left side. She has about a 2 mm open bite. She has a crossbite that has developed now on the right side and anterior. She has end-on incisor relationship.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence and evidence of previous surgery with bilateral Mitek anchors in place and 4 bone screws in each ramus body area. There are 4 bone plates in the maxilla and there is hydroxyapatite synthetic bone grafts in the maxillary area. She has an implant in the maxillary left central incisor area, and she has a 6-unit bridge on the mandibular right side going from cuspid through third molar, and on the right side she has a 3-unit bridge from lower first bicuspid to first molar. She has crowns on most all of her posterior teeth. In the TMJ area, there are arthritic changes in both changes. There is definite heterotopic bone development in the left fossa, both vertically between the condyle and the fossa and around the posterior aspect between the condyle and the posterior rim of the fossa. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a Mitek anchor in it. The condyle is postured downward and forward in the fossa. The articular eminence is essentially gone as the heterotopic bone level comes down at least equal or below the level of the articular eminence. Right TMJ tomogram shows a joint that has some arthritic changes in it and slightly decreased, but still present, joint space. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has an end-on incisor relationship. Oropharyngeal airway appears adequate.

In B261's previous surgeries, we performed the following procedures:
Multiple maxillary osteotomies with HA grafting and bone plates. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies.
Bilateral tempomandibular joint articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral tempomandibular joint eminectomies. Arthroplasty of the left mandibular condyle.
Placement of abdominal fat graft into the bilateral TMJ joint areas.
External rhinoplasty.
Excision of lesion off the right neck.

Basic diagnoses for B261 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis. Bony tumor growing in the left glenoid fossa area. Mandibular deviated prognathism.
Class III occlusion on the left side, Class II end-on on the right side. Crossbite on the right side.
Posterior open bite on the left side of approximately 2-3 mm. Bilateral TMJ pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol). Surgery. Bilateral TMJ condylectomies and meniscectomies. Removal of bony tumor left temporal bone on glenoid fossa area. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with TMJ Concept total joint prostheses.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts. Placement of arch bars.

B261 
Telephone conversation. She would like to be treated without having total joint prostheses. I told her the only option we would have would be to try and go in and remove the reactive bone that has formed particularly in the left joint, but I did not know how good of an outcome we could get doing that since it would create an arthritic situation in the fossa component at least and may not prevent the redevelopment of heterotopic bone. Also I have no prediction of how it would affect her pain problems. She says her pain has increased significantly since her appointment with me. I discussed at length the prosthesis and also mentioned that we could do implants to check for hypersensitivity to the materials if she would like to do that. She will contact me if she would like to do that. I answered all the questions she had at this time. She apparently has done some research on the internet and knows that there are devices with which there can be major problems. I discussed those devices with her that are particularly problematic such as the Vitek implants and the Christiansen prosthesis. She will contact me if she has any other questions. B261  MRI EVALUATION 
AGE: DOB:

Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal views shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. A little rough bone on the superior surface with some small osteophytes. There appears to be reasonably good mediolateral width of the condyle. Joint space looks fairly good.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is somewhat smaller than the opposite side mediolaterally and also vertically. Joint space does not look too bad.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There is actually fair good joint space. There appears to be discal tissue between the condyle and the fossa. There is some fluid anterior in both the superior and inferior joint space. Some bony changes on the head of the condyle compatible with the procedure performed which includes the presence of a Mitek anchor in the condyle. There possibly could be some excessive development of bone in the fossa area displacing the condyle inferiorly. There is an osteophyte sticking out of the posterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence appears to blend in with the bone mass that appears to be in the fossa.

Right TMJ sagittal views shows a condyle that has some arthritis. A Mitek anchor is present in the condylar head. There appears to be some fatty tissue in and around the joint area. It appears there is some discal tissue displaced posterior in the condyle.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis, but significant heterotopic bone formation in the fossa that is displacing the condyle downward. Right TMJ arthritis with a slightly posteriorly displaced articular disc.
