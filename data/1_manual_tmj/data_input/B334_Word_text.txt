B334 
B334 is 15-1/2 years old and referred by Dr. __.
Patient History
B334 is in good health with no major medical problems. She does have a history of asthma and seasonal allergies. She takes albuterol as needed for her asthma. She doesn't need it very often. The only other medication she takes is Motrin when she gets acute cramping during her menstrual cycle.

She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She has no problems wearing jewelry. Her mother is aware of nocturnal clenching and bruxism. She doesn't really have any significant headache problems. She rates her TMJ pain at a level of 5, and this occurs particularly when she is trying to eat. She rates her daily pain at about 6, jaw function and diet at 5, disability at 3.

Patient Concerns
Popping in the right jaw joint
Teeth and jaws don't fit together
Pain bilaterally in the jaw areas particularly when she eats
Clinical Examination

In frontal view, she has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline and chin are shifted off to the right side about 1 to 2 mm.

In profile view, she has fairly good balance between the upper lips, cheeks, and nose. The lower jaw appears retruded by probably about 10 mm. Maxilla could be posterior by maybe just a couple of millimeters. Chin-neckline is short, although chin-neck angle is fairly well-defined. Vertical facial height appears to be in fairly good balance. As B334 postures her mandible forward into a Class I cuspid position, it significantly improves her profile. It makes her upper lip appear to be in better balance.

Intraorally, B334 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Lower teeth appear to be nicely aligned and leveled or maybe just a slight increased curve of Spee. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a full Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally with about a 6-mm overjet relationship. She has an anterior deep bite of probably mm. She has a little bit of orbital dystopia with the right side being about 2 mm higher than the left side. Transversely, the occlusal plane is fairly level. To palpation, she has moderate discomfort over the masseters and styloid areas and high moderate to low severe tenderness over the TMJs bilaterally. In the right joint, she has an opening click at about 2 mm and closing click at 15 mm. On the left side, the joint seems to function relatively smoothly at this time. Oropharynx appears clear. Tonsils are present but appear normal in size. She does have a bit of a length uvula. She sleeps predominantly on her side, so she doesn't give any history of any significant snoring problems. B334 has fairly large turbinates, although she does have a passable airway on both sides. She is not aware of any difficulties breathing through her nose for the most part.

Maximal incisal opening is 55 mm but with reasonable comfort 31 mm. Excursive movements are about 11 mm in each direction. She does have popping if she shifts her jaw toward the left side then a reciprocal pop as she goes back toward the right side.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows that there are four impacted third molars, all completely bony impacted. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates look fairly large, although there does appear to be a passable airway. Condyles look relatively normal. Left condylar head and neck appear a little bit longer than the right head and condylar neck. An x-ray from shows that even back then she had a longer condyle and neck on the left side as compared to the right side.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have a fairly good long condylar head and neck. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa and has a decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminences are moderately steep. Appears to be some mild arthritic changes in the right condyle.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, but some flattening can be seen on the head and a little bit of anterior beaking is seen with some mild sclerosis. There seems to be evidence of condylar resorption present.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with a good shape. Appears to be decreased vertical joint space. Appears to be a little anterior beaking present on the condyle. Vertical and posterior joint space appears to be somewhat compromised.

On opening, there is good translation of that condyle. The condylar head on the left side looks much better than the head of the condyle on the right side.

Waters view shows that one orbit may be a little bit higher than the other orbit. Mandible appears a little bit asymmetrical.
Cephalometrically, B334 has a Class II skeletal relationship and occlusal relationship. Lower incisors appear to be overangulated. There is a tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of about 1 mm. The tooth-size discrepancy on the models appears to be somewhat greater probably due to the excessive inclination of the lower incisors and the slight vertical inclination of the maxillary incisors.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation and arthritis, being worse on the right side
AP mandibular deficiency
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency Accentuated curve of Spee, lower arch
Slight overangulation of lower incisors
High occlusal plane angulation of 15 degrees (normal angle 8 degrees)
Anterior deep bite
Tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of 1 to 2 mm
Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars
TMJ pain
Myofascial pain

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Keep upper lateral incisors tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies if they are necessary at the time of surgery
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 1 to 2 mm of tooth structure and retract. Consider using an occlusal splint that would posture her mandible forward just a little bit (perhaps 2 to 3 mm) and occlude with the upper teeth, but only the second molars and incisors would hit on the splint with the lower teeth. Create vertical space between the undersurface of the splint and the bicuspids and first molar teeth. Then extrude the bicuspids and first molars vertically to decrease the accentuated curve of Spee

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to downgraft the posterior aspect and decrease the occlusal plane angle
Surgical removal of impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B334 MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of :
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Condyle has an inferior hook associated on the medial aspect. Joint space appears significantly decreased vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa has a very minimal downward curvature. Cortical bone appears to be intact on the condyle. Disc could possibly be medially displaced.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears significantly deformed and actually difficult to completely identify the condylar head. Appears to be bone on the medial side that curves downward and back underneath the head of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa has a relatively small amount of downward curvature. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. Discal tissues are extremely difficult to identify.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with fairly reasonable shape to it but a little bit of anterior beaking present. More medially there is decreased anteroposterior dimension. Out laterally, the cortical bone on the top is hard to identify. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. No particular inflammatory process seen.

On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, and it appears that the disc probably reduces. The articular eminence is fairly steep out laterally but less steep medially.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has undergone significant arthritic changes. Toward the mid lateral aspect of the joint, there is some fairly severe peaking of the condyle. There is also a significantly decreased posterior joint space. Articular disc is sitting fairly close to the undersurface of the articular eminence. The disc appears somewhat deformed. There is some fluid in the superior joint space.

On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, and the disc appears to be nonreducing. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Difficult to tell if the disc is salvageable or not. Clinical correlation may be required.

Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction
Right TMJ arthritis (worse than the left side) with articular disc dislocation and possibly nonreducing
Questionable salvageability of the articular disc, and clinical correlation will be helpful

Radiologist read out the MRI as the right side articular disc being displaced but reducing on opening, but on the left side the disc was displaced and nonreducing.
