B357 
B357 is 14 years and 7 months of age, referred by Dr. __. She is in good health with no major medical problems. She takes no medications. About three or four years ago when she was in the 5th grade she began to develop some headache problems and was taken to a pediatrician at that time. The pediatrician was unable to identify any specific cause of it. B357 was late in losing her primary teeth. She apparently was programed for a Herbst appliance but because of the late loss of her primary teeth that was never initiated. She was treated by Dr. __ , from 2 years ago to last year although she never had much done relative to adjustments.

She has no pain in her jaw joints. She gets headaches at about a level of 3 that occur predominately on the left side in the frontal and temple area that she notes behind her left eye and in her left forehead area. Also, they occur in the back of the head. Average daily pain is 1, jaw function is 2, diet is 0, disability 1. She has no problems with earaches, gets occasional tinnitus and occasional vertigo. She has no other joint problems.

She is tired quite a bit. She was taken for a sleep study at Stanford University about two to three years ago and it showed that she had some mild sleep apnea at that time. She is very tired during the day. Her mother states that B357  does sometimes clench and make noise with her teeth at nighttime.

In frontal view, B357 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Perhaps slightly a little more fullness on the right side than the left side by maybe about 3 mm. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 2 mm. Maxillary midline and mandibular dental midline and chin midline are pretty much aligned with each other but may be just about 1 mm off towards the left side. The nasal tip is about 1 to 2 mm off to the right side. In profile view, B357 has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks and nose. A little bit of a C-shape curve in the upper lip. Upper lip supralabrale may be just slightly forward of nasal perpendicular. Chin is retruded by probably 15 to 18 mm. She has a head postured forward neck position. Chin-neckline and chin-neck angle are fairly well defined. As B357 postures her mandible forward, it does improve her profile. Intraorally, B357 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth although they are a little bit thin vertically. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. Mild crowding in the upper arch. She has almost a reverse curve of Wilson in the upper arch. She has a Class II end-on cuspid molar relationship bilaterally probably 5 to 6 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of about 7 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Uvula and soft palate may be mildly elongated. Faucial pillars may be mildly constricted. Tonsils are present and are of moderate size. Right nostril is a little bit constricted compared to the left due primarily to the fact that the cartilaginous _______ comes a little bit off center on the right side. Turbinates are moderately enlarged and possibly could be contributing some to some nasal airway obstruction. She does have some snoring and she has some daytime somnolence. She was diagnosed with mild sleep apnea. Maximal incisal opening is 53 mm. Excursive movements are about 8 mm in each direction. She has no tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. She has a slight click on excursion in the left joint but otherwise, the joints seem to function reasonably smoothly today.  

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars that are unerupted. Some malrotation of the lower cuspids and upper right cuspids present. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. Difficult to evaluate the TMJs on this view.

Waters view shows the sinuses look relatively clear. Right frontal sinus is not as clear as the left frontal sinus. The bony septum appears to have perhaps a spur off on the right side. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. It may be a little bit posteriorly positioned. Articular eminence is relatively normal in slope and length. Joint space appears fairly well balanced except for some slight posterior decrease.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has very good shape. Articular eminence appears a little bit steeper on this side than the opposite side. Joint space appears fairly well balanced although it may be just slightly decreased at the posterior aspect. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B357 has a moderate high occlusal plane angle and a short vertical dimension in the mandible. Oropharyngeal airway is somewhat constricted. She has a fairly large adenoid tissue in the nasopharynx. Tonsils can be seen as well. There is about a 2 mm tooth size discrepancy at the lower anterior teeth. Lower first bicuspids are almost 1 mm larger than the maxillary first bicuspids. She has an accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Rule out TMJ articular disc dislocations.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP microgenia.
Over angulation of lower incisors.
Class II end-on occlusion.
Accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch.
Anterior mandibular vertical deficiency.
Impacted third molars x4. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasopharyngeal adenoid hyperplasia. Nasal airway obstruction. Headaches. Joint noises. External nasal deformity. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.

B357
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: MRI of left and right TMJs. Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm of tooth structure. Consider removing 1 mm of tooth structure from the mandibularfirst bicuspids as they are excessively large compared to the maxillary first bicuspids. Consider using turbos to open the bite in order to help level the lower arch accentuated curve of Spee.
Try to gently expand both the maxillary and mandibular arches transversely to better accommodate the crowding of the anterior arches. Surgery.
TMJ surgery if indicated (will be dependent upon the MRI.)
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomy to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to down graft the posterior aspect. Horizontal osteotomy to advance the chin. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
Cranial bone graft to nasal dorsum.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat deformed. Mediolateral width may be fairly good. Lateral rim of the fossa is actually fairly flat. The disc may be medially displaced. It appears there may be a little osteophyte at the lateral aspect of the condyle. The top of the condyle is somewhat flat. There appears to be discal tissue medial and anterior to the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be a lateral osteophyte sticking out almost beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There may be some discal tissue medial to the condyle. Joint space looks reasonably good. The condyle does appear somewhat arthritic.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the anterior head and some anterior beaking particularly towards the medial side of the joint. Articular eminence is fairly steep. There appears to be discal tissue in fairly good position. Towards the medial side of the joint, the articular eminence appears to have some osseous changes associated with it. There does not appear to be much inflammatory process around the joint.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of an anterior beak. Out laterally there appears to be a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep but not quite as steep as the opposite side. On the rest of the views the disc appears to be in position but difficult to see the disc at the lateral aspect of the joint. A small amount of fluid in the superior joint space but not too significant. No open views available.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis with possible medial displacement of the articular discs.
