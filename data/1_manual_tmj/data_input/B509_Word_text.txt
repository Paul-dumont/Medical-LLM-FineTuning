B509
B509 is 21 years old. B509 is referred by Dr. XXXX. She also had received my name from Dr. XXXX. B509's TMJ problems began when she was about 14 years old of unknown etiology. The pain became much worse when she was 15. She had splint therapy beginning 7 years ago that lasted for 15 months, and then 5 years ago she had splint therapy for an additional 3 years without relief. She has had physical therapy from ages 14 to 15 and then it was repeated 5 years ago and again 3 years ago;

Primary concerns that B509 has are as follows:
Jaw pain.
Ear pain. Headaches.
She rates her headaches at a level of 7 and they occur throughout her head. She has headaches daily and they are fairly continuous. She rates her average TMJ pain at 4, average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 6, diet at 3, disability at 3. She gets bilateral earaches, but no tinnitus, no vertigo, and has no hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching at nighttime. She takes occasional ibuprofen or Aleve for her headaches.

In frontal view, B509 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 4 mm. The maxillary midline may be about 1 mm off to the right side. The mandibular dental midline is probable about 3 mm off to the right side. The chin is probably 4-5 mm off towards the right side. In profile, she might have just some slight AP maxillary deficiency in the subnasale area. The chin appears to be retruded about 12-15 mm. The chin neckline is a little bit short, although the chin neck angle is fairly well defined. The lower third face appears somewhat elongated. She has to strain her lips to get them together. Intraorally, B509 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She appears to have an accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. She is almost a full Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and probably 4 to 5 mm Class II on the left side. She has an over jet of about 4 mm. She has some mild crowding of the upper anterior arch. She has about 0.5 mm anterior deep bite relationship. The maxillary arch appears transversely narrow. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal except the right tonsil is moderately enlarged and the left one is mildly enlarged. The fascial pillar is a little bit constricted on the right side because of the tonsil on that side. She has just a slight transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being about 1 mm higher than the left side. Intranasally, the turbinates appear mild to moderate in size and the septum is deviated off towards the right side. She has some moderate nasal airway obstruction on the right side. On opening, it seemed like she had a little bit of a real soft click in the right joint at about 10 mm of opening and closing at about 5 mm. The left side seemed reasonably smooth. The maximal incisal opening is 46 mm, but opening without pain and discomfort 20 mm. Excursion movement to the right is 7 mm, to the left 9 mm. B509 apparently feels that she has been getting some gingival recession around her teeth. She did use a medium bristled toothbrush, but has now switched a soft one and she uses Sensodyne toothpaste. She has had a complete otological workup including a CAT scan and they found no pathology in the ear that would account for her pain factors.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars, but all the rest of teeth are present. The bony septum appears straight. Both turbinates appear enlarged.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is more arthritic with sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically and anteroposteriorly. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There is some double imaging indicative of perhaps some movement during the x-ray taking.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a little peaking of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint. The joint space looks a little bit better on this side and there is a little less sclerotic bone on the head of the condyle.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width, although the condyle is smaller than the opposite side. The joint space is a little bit decreased. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 or 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is slightly larger than the left one. There appears to be reasonably good joint space. The condyle appears a little more healthier on this side than the opposite side.

Coronal view shows that there are moderate turbinates and some nasal spurring off the septum. The sinuses appear relatively clear.
Axial view shows enlargement of the turbinates particularly on the right side. The septum appears reasonably straight.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B509 has a Class II skeletal relationship. She has got a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway is about 7 mm at the soft palate level and about 7 mm at the base of the tongue. There is an increase occlusal plane angle and a Class II occlusion. Basic diagnosis for B509 would be as follows:

Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated, left side non-reducing and right side early reduction (compatible with AICR).
Maxillary anterior vertical hyperplasia, posterior vertical hypoplasia, and transverse hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Class II occlusion with anterior open bite tendency.
AP microgenia.
TMJ pain.
Headaches. Myofascial pain. Hypertrophied turbinates.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Place a step in the arch wire to align the 4 incisors at an elevated plane level compared to the posterior teeth. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract.
2.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction, expand and level the occlusal plane. d.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to augment the chin. e.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
3.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B509 MRI
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little arthritic. It has an erosion in the anterior part of the condylar head. There is also sclerosis on the condyle as well. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination and the joint space actually looks reasonably good. On opening, the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. There is some restriction in translation, although the condylar head comes down almost beneath the articular eminence.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of peaking on the top of the condyle. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The joint space actually looks reasonably good. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. The articular disc appears to be reduce and there is moderately good translation of the condyle and disc.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is sclerosis on the top of the condyle. Vertical joint space appears a little bit decreased. There may be some discal tissue medially but anteriorly displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 or 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to a little bit healthier than the opposite side with good mediolateral width. It appears discal tissue is anteriorly displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction with degenerative changes.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction on opening.
