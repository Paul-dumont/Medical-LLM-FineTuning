B311 
B311 is 33 years old and is referred by Dr. __. B311 is in good health with no major medical problems.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Popping in the jaw joints.
Locking in the joints.
Headaches.
Problems with swallowing.
B311's problems began when he was about 13 years old. He cannot remember if it started during orthodontics or after orthodontics was completed. He had orthodontics from about the age of 12 or 13 and had four bicuspid extractions performed. Maxillary and mandibular teeth were retracted. At about the age of 13, he became aware of clicking and popping in his jaw joints although they did not cause him any pain or discomfort at that time. Dr. __ made a splint for B311 sometime around 4 years ago. It did not really help very much. He was then referred to Dr. __. He did some electrical stimulation, injection and cream application but this likewise did not improve the situation. He was then referred to Dr. __ , who made another splint for B311 but B311's pain seemed to increase with this splint and with the adjustments made on it. He also has had some massage therapy. Dr. __ also placed him on an anti-inflammatory and a muscle relaxant that helped some but was not consistent in improving the situation,

B311 gets headaches in the frontal, temporal and posterior head area at about a level of 9. His TMJ pain is at a level of 10, average daily pain at 8, jaw function 6, diet at 5, disability at 3. He gets earaches bilaterally and has tinnitus and gets occasional vertigo. He is not aware of any significant hearing loss. The only other joints that really bother him are his wrists. He is aware of clenching and bruxism at nighttime and also during the day. B311 was getting pretty bad headaches and at one point was evaluated by Dr. __ who did a brain CAT scan and MRI but nothing abnormal was noted. They did find an unusual lesion in the brain but it turned out that the consensus was that it was just some fatty tissue there that had probably been there all his life.

In frontal view, B311 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Nasal tip is tipped off the left side by probably about 2 to 3 mm. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm. Maxillary midline and mandibular dental midline are pretty much on the facial midline. There appears to be some slight asymmetry in the chin that could be just 1 mm or so off towards the left side but not too significant. In profile view, the upper lip supralabrale is probably a good 3 to 4 mm posterior to subnasale. The mandible is also retruded. The labial mental fold is quite prominent. There is no definition of the chin-neckline. The maxilla is retruded by at least 5 to 8 mm. Chin is retruded by probably about 15 mm. Intraorally, B311 is missing his lower first bicuspids. Lower teeth are tipped lingually quite a ways. The posterior teeth are tipped lingually slightly with a slight increased curve of Wilson. The lower arch is constricted transversely. In the upper arch, B311 is missing the first bicuspids as well. He has a little bit of increased curve of Wilson in the upper arch. B311 

He has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. He has about a 3 mm vertical overbite relationship. The uvula is moderately enlarged. The soft palate may be moderately elongated. Faucial pillars are mildly constricted. Tonsils appear relatively normal. Intranasally, the turbinate on the right side is significantly enlarged but on the left side looks relatively normal in size with the exception of good airway on the left side. The septum appears relatively straight or just slightly off towards the right side. He has some mild snoring moreso when he is on his back. He has some mild daytime somnolence but is not aware of any sleep apnea factors. He is a light sleeper and wakes up frequently. To palpation, there is some mild tenderness over the TMJs and right styloid area. On opening, there is an audible click on the left side about 30 mm but B311 reports that the right side clicks about the same time. On closing, there is a more palpable click on the right side about 10 mm but the left side has a click at about the same level. Maximal incisal opening is about 50 mm. He can open reasonably comfortably about 40 mm although his joints had already clicked at that point. Excursive movement to the right is 10 mm, left 9 mm. On excursive movement, he has no clicking. This means the discs are displaced and non-reducing on excursive movements.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and all four first bicuspids. The sinuses look relatively clear. The right turbinate appears somewhat enlarged compared to the left side. Difficult to evaluate the TMJs.

Left TMJ tomogram on the closed view shows that the condyle is displaced posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is an increased anterior joint space. Disc is probably in a vertical orientation or anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit more arthritic than the left side. There is a pseudocyst in the mid part of the condyle and a little sclerosis on top. Decreased posterior joint space. The condyle has more of a hockey stick shape to it compared to the opposite side. Articular eminence seems a little bit steeper on this side compared to the opposite side. On opening there is moderately good translation of both joints.

Waters view shows that the septum may be deviated significantly off to the right side back in the bony area. There appears to be some obstruction in the nasal airway on the right side with the turbinate being moderately large. The left looks like the airway is good. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Frontal sinus is quite large.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B311  has a retruded maxilla and mandible but macrogenia likely related to his previous orthodontics. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 7 to 7.5 m at the soft palate level and about 7 to 8 mm at the base of the tongue. Maxilla and mandible appear retruded particularly in dental alveolar area. Sinuses appear a little bit vertically oriented.

B311 
BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with late reduction.
AP maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency. AP macrogenia.
Missing all four first bicuspids from previous orthodontics.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Snoring.
TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain. Headaches. Earaches. Tinnitus. Vertigo.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla approximately 6 mm.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible.
AP reduction genioplasty.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B311  MRI EVALUATION 
AGE: 33/M
DOB: 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic. A little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. Decreased lateral joint space. There appears to be discal tissue anteriorly positioned to the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat arthritic. A little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle but not too bad. Joint space appears a little bit better balanced. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes. Out laterally the condyle is very narrow anteroposteriorly with anterior beaking present. More medial the condyle has a little bit of increased width. A little bit of sclerosis on the top of the condyle. Articular eminence is of moderate inclination. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and the posterior band is quite thickened. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and what appears to be reduction of the articular disc in the medial view but in the open view the disc appears to be anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has arthritic changes with a little bit of anterior beaking. Articular eminence has moderate inclination. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced, somewhat deformed and the posterior band is thickened. On opening, again in the mid open view it is appears that the disc is reduced and in the open view the posterior band of the disc is not identifiable but it is assumed that the disc is still in a reduced position. Translation is fairly good.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated without reduction and deformation of the disc. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
