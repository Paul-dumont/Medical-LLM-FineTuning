B251
B251 is 47 years old, referred by Dr. . She has had a number of previous surgeries including surgery at C5-6, colon polyp removed, previous gallbladder surgery, hernia repair, breast reduction and previous TMJ surgery to place the articular disc back into position. B251's jaw problems began 10 years ago when she was involved in a motor vehicle accident causing a displacement of her articular disc. Since then she has undergone orthodontics x2 and numerous splints since 9 years ago and extensive physical therapy with several different physical therapists over the past 10 years. She did have surgery 2 yeaars ago. Surgery consisted of bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Two anchors were placed on the left side and one anchor on the right side. Earlier this year, she had a botox injection to the left temporalis muscle. This has helped decrease her pain in that area some although she still has significant pain there. B251  also has been treated with two rounds of doxycycline which she was placed on for several months on two different occasions without any noticeable change or improvement. A follow-up MRI donetwo years ago demonstrated that she has a displaced disc on the left joint with decreased joint space. The right joint disc may be slightly displaced but for the most part it appears in reasonable position. B251 has constant headaches in the frontotemporal, posterior head and top of the head area. They easily escalate to a level of 9. The pain is worse on the left side to the point where sometimes she cannot wear her glasses. She rates her TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at around 7, jaw function at 4, diet at 3, disability at 8. She gets earaches, left side worse than the right side and also gets tinnitus and vertigo. She is aware of clenching at nighttime and during the day. She has endometriosis. She has some problems with her right hip and with her knees occasionally.

B251 does have some reaction to medications including morphine and a number of narcotics that will cause itching for her. She also had an adverse reaction to tetanus and also to iodine. She is not aware of having any significant problems wearing jewelry and can wear cheap earrings without any difficulty. She did have one reaction in the past to a watch and that is the only reaction she can recall.

In frontal view, B251 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary, mandibular and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. Nasal tip is a little bit off to the right side bilaterally by 1 to 2 mm. In profile view, B251 has some slight AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 3 to 4 mm. Chin may be retruded by approximately 8 to 10 mm. Chin-neckline is short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B251 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has crowns on the posterior teeth from second bicuspids through the first molars and on the left side including the second molar. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a fairly good Class I cuspid molar relationship. She has anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. The uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all appear relatively normal. B251 has a slightly deviated nasal septum but not too significant. Turbinates look relatively normal. There does not appear to be any obvious airway obstruction. Columella is slightly wide and the nostrils may be just slightly narrow. Luminal valves may be slightly constricted. She has moderate to severe snoring problems. She has moderate daytime somnolence. Her husband John states that he witnesses where B251  holds her breath and then gasps for air. B251  To palpation she has high moderate pain over the masseter area, TMJs, moderate pain over the styloids, SCMs, posterior neck, shoulders, milder discomfort over the temporalis and medial pterygoids. On opening, she has a definite click in the left joint at 20 mm and a closing click at about 10. The right joint seems to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is about 30 mm with effort. Opening without significant pain about 20 mm. Excursive movement to the right 7 with popping and to the left about 9 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of Mitek anchors in the TMJ areas bilaterally. She is missing all 4 third molars and she has root canals on the maxillary left first and second bicuspids, right second bicuspid. She has crowns on most the posterior teeth on the left side and on the right second bicuspid first molar in the mandible and second bicuspid in the maxilla. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The sinuses appear clear. Difficult to evaluate the heads of the condyle particularly on the left side.

Waters view shows that the bony septum appear fairly straight. Turbinates appear moderate in size. It may be a little bit large posteriorly. It could cause some obstruction. Sinuses for the most part appear relatively healthy.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a joint space that looks reasonably good. Anchor is present in the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep.
Left TMJ tomogram shows there appears to be a decreased joint space vertically and posteriorly. There are two anchors in the condyle. On opening, there is reasonable translation of both joints.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is decreased AP position in the maxilla and mandible. There is a decreased oropharyngeal airway with a dimension at the soft palate level of about 6 mm and at the base of the tongue about 3 mm. The tongue is postured low in the oral cavity, however, in this view.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Post status bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral TMJ reactive arthritis with displaced disc on the left side. AP mandibular deficiency.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
TMJ pain.
Bilateral severe TMJ pain.
Severe headaches.
Myofascial pain. Sleep apnea.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. CT scans of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla and down graft it posteriorly.
Bilateral coronoidectomies. Bilateral TMJ fat graft (harvest from the abdomen.)
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B251  MRI Evaluation
MRI was taken on _____. At that time she was 45 years old.
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Joint space appears a little bit decreased. The disc appears probably anteriorly displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view appears to have reasonable condyle. Joint space is greater on this side compared to the opposite side. There may be discal tissue in position. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly approximately 2 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Otherwise, shape is fairly normal. Articular eminence has a relatively normal inclination. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced, but appears to have good morphology. A little bit of fluid in the joint spaces. On opening there is good translation and reduction of the articular disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. A little bit of flattening in the anterior head and a little bit of sclerosis is present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be in reasonably good position although slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. A little bit of fluid in the joint spaces. On opening there is good translation and reduction of the articular disc.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated but with reduction.
Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced but with early reduction.

MRI :
Left TMJ coronal view shows the presence of Mitek anchors perhaps x2. Joint space appears decreased and may be of greater decrease than presurgery. Cortical bone still appears to be intact. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of probably 2 mm.

Right TMJ shows the presence of an anchor. Joint space looks a little bit wider on this side. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 1 to 2 mm. Difficult to tell where the discal tissue is. Cortical bone appears to be intact.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is an anchor present down in the neck of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced, but still has good morphology. On opening, translation is not as good as it was before surgery but the disc appears to reduce into position. The disc appears a little bit more degenerated on these films as compared to the original films. There is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle and some flattening.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with evidence of a Mitek anchor in place. A couple of hot spots within the condyle itself. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be in reasonably good position. Out laterally, it is slightly anteriorly displaced. More medial, however, it appears to be in fairly good position. On opening there is slightly better translation than the opposite side. Disc is in position on opening. There is some flattening on the anterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking present.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction. Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc in reasonably good position although it could be just slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint.
