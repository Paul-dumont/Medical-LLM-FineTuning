B330 
B330 is 17 years old and referred by Dr. __.
Patient History
She has had some previous extractions. The parents think that started her orthodontic treatment 5 years ago and completed orthodontic treatment 2 years ago. At the completion of treatment it was felt that 's bite fit together pretty well. is in good health with no major medical problems. She has some allergy problems, and she takes Nasonex and Allegra 180 mg that she takes daily. The only previous surgery she has had is extractions of probably some of her primary teeth and probably four first bicuspids. To the best of 's knowledge, the onset of the jaw problems began after her appliances were removed sometime 2 years ago. This was when it was first noted that she began to develop some discomfort and also that her jaw started to become more retruded. This is also about the time that she noted that she had difficulties opening her mouth as wide as she may have been able to previously. Her dad, Dr. __, is a dentist and has done some minor equilibrations, although this has not really helped 's situation.

does have Raynaud's phenomenon affecting her fingers and her toes. It seems to be aggravated when she is exposed to cold. She tends to have a more hoarse-type voice quality. When was in the seventh grade, they can back from a family vacation at the beach, and got quite sick and lost her voice for three weeks. She also had blisters associated with her ears and skin. They were never able to identify what caused the problem. has been evaluated by an ENT specialist, and they have not identified the presence of any vocal cord nodules or any apparent dysfunction of the vocal cords at this time.

's father also has significant joint problems. His ankles have been affected. The biggest problem he has is with his knees, and he had an arthritic toe on one foot and has some back stiffness, but the biggest problem is with the knees currently. He does get iritis and has had three detached retinas.

Patient Concerns
Pain and discomfort in the jaw joints
Bite and jaw relationship are changing with the lower jaw becoming more retruded
Decreased jaw opening
Difficulties eating and chewing certain foods

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 4 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline and chin are also fairly well-aligned to the facial midline.

In profile view, she has some just slight AP deficiency in the maxilla of probably about mm. Chin appears to be retruded maybe about 8 mm. Chin-neckline is a little bit short, but the chin-neck angle is fairly well-defined. A little bit of fullness in the submental area.

Intraorally, is missing the lower first bicuspids. Has relatively minimal attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. Roots are fairly prominent there. Crowns, however, appear to be tipped lingually just a little bit. Second molars are tipped buccally compared to the first molars. In the upper arch, she also is missing the first bicuspids. She has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. In centric relation, she has a Class II end-on occlusion being about 3 mm Class II bilaterally. She has an overjet of about 3 mm. She has an overbite of about 2 mm. Transversely, the occlusal plane is fairly level. Oropharynx appears clear, and tissues look good and healthy. Soft palate and uvula look relatively normal. Faucial pillars may be just a little bit constricted but not of anything of any significance.

Intranasally, the septum is deviated just a little bit off toward the left side but not too significantly. Turbinates are sort of mildly enlarged, but there does not appear to be any obvious airway obstruction problems at least in the anterior portion of the nose. Nostrils are relatively normal as is the columella.

To palpation, has mild tenderness over the TMJs, left masseter muscle, and left styloid area. TMJs seem to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is 34 mm, and she can open about 20 mm without significant discomfort. Excursive movement to the right is 6 mm and to the left 7 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four first bicuspids and the presence of four impacted third molars. Left sinus looks a little bit cloudy compared to the right side. Left turbinate appears a little bit enlarged compared to the right turbinate. Condyles appear a little bit arthritic with the right one looking a little bit worse than the left one. Articular eminences appear fairly long in length and moderately steep.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are relatively clear, although the left one might be a just a touch more cloudy than the right one but not too significant on this view. Septum appears relatively straight. Right turbinate appears a little bit enlarged compared to the left one, although there probably is an open airway bilaterally.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic and appears to have lost vertical height and also perhaps some anteroposterior dimension as well. Significantly decreased posterior joint space on at least one of the views. Articular eminence is moderately steep and elongated. Could be some slightly increased vertical joint space between the condyle and the fossa, but that is seen in one view, and in another view it appears that there may be some osteophytes sticking up perhaps.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have lost vertical height and appears narrow anteroposteriorly. Appears to be some decreased vertical joint space toward the posterior aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Open views on the tomograms show restricted translation bilaterally with both condyles being restricted in translation, and although they come down the articular eminence, they fall quite a bit short of getting to the articular eminence itself.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows a slight anterior vertical maxillary excess, high occlusal plane angle, and a retruded mandible. Oropharyngeal airway appears reasonably good, although it may be slightly constricted in the soft palate to posterior pharyngeal wall area at the narrowest dimension. Appears to be an overjet of about 3 mm. Vertical height of the condylar head and neck appears somewhat shortened. There is a slight tooth-size discrepancy with a 's difference of about 2 mm.

In comparing the lateral cephalometric radiograph from Dr. __ from 2 years ago to the one taken at my office today, B330 has had at least 3 mm of posterior movement of the mandible in that timeframe. This confirms that it is a progressive situation for her. Basic Diagnoses

Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocations without reductions
Anterior vertical maxillary excess
AP maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular deficiency
Class II end-on occlusion
Missing all four first bicuspids Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4
TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Masticatory dysfunction
Pituitary gland tumor (probably benign)
Chronic hoarseness of the voice

Recommended Treatment
Further evaluation of pituitary gland tumor
Antibiotic treatment using Levaquin 500 mg 1 tablet q.d. for 30 days to see if that has any affect on voice hoarseness

Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch
If at all possible, try to expand both the maxillary and mandibular arches at the posterior aspects

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superiorly and advance it forward
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction
Surgical removal of four impacted third molars

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B330  MRI Scan Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of :
Coronal view MRI quality is only fair.

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit narrow in width. Some sclerosis present in the head of the condyle. Appears that there may be some erosion in the head of the condyle in some areas that light up much more than the adjacent tissues. Decreased lateral joint space. Difficult to identify discal tissue, although there appears to be some anteromedial to the condylar head. Lateral rim of the fossa curves moderately inferiorly by about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears to have a little osteophyte growing up from the center of it. Condyle appears somewhat arthritic. May be slightly decreased mediolateral width. Lateral rim of fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount of 2 to 3 mm. Joint space appears somewhat decreased between the osteophyte and the roof of the orbit. Could be some decreased joint space further anteriorly.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears arthritic with some anterior beaking present. Some flattening of the posterior head and anterior head. Condyle is wider out laterally than it is over medially. Articular eminence is fairly steep and elongated. The steepness may not be quite as great as the opposite side. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost directly beneath the articular eminence.

On opening, the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. The disc is foreshortened. Though it is nonreducing, it does appear that it does translate some.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has undergone some significant arthritic changes. Anterior beaking is present, and some areas of sclerosis are present on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence appears fairly steep. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. Is sitting beneath the articular eminence. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. Appears to be moderately decreased posterior joint space. Condyle appears to be wider laterally, and over medially it appears extremely narrow anteroposteriorly.

On opening, there is moderate translation with some restriction, and the condylar head does not go down beneath the articular eminence. Articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. There is a little area of fluid in the superior joint space between the articular eminence and the unreduced articular disc. This does demonstrate some movement.

There is an area that appears to show increased activity in the pituitary gland area.
Impression:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reductions and with significant deformation of the discs Rule out pituitary gland tumor
