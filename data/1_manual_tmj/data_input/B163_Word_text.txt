B163
B163 is 15 years old. Referred by XXXX. B163's primary concerns are as follows:
Cannot close her teeth together properly. Teeth and jaws do not fit together. Popping and clicking in the jaws.
Pain and tension in the jaws. Headaches. TMJ pain. Chronic fatigue.

B163's TMJ problems began when she was about 11 years of age of unknown etiology. She had orthodontics from the age of 11 to 13. Upon completion of her first round of orthodontics, she still had a cross bite on the right side and perhaps an anterior cross bite tendency as well. Her maxilla was expanded with a palatal expander device. At age 14, the appliances were placed again. She has had reverse head gear and other treatment.

B163 rates her headaches, which are constant, at about a level of 8 and they occur in the temporal and posterior head areas. She rates her TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 7, jaw function at 6, diet at 0, disability at 7. As she opens, her left TMJ sometimes will lock open and it is difficult for her close it. Medications she takes includes BCP and Advil. She does get some moderate earaches, occasional tinnitus, and frequent vertigo. She has low blood pressure and she feels that the vertigo may be related to her low blood pressure. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She does tend to breath through her mouth when she sleeps at night. She has no snoring, but has moderate to severe daytime somnolence, but no sleep apnea problems. Her lower jaw has been getting continuously further shifted off towards the right side.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B163 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length measures about 16 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Right eye might be about good 3 mm lower then the left eye. The mandibular dental midline is almost 5 mm off towards the right side. Lower dental midline and chin are fairly well aligned with each other. The maxillary arch is fairly level. Mandibular arch on the right side is about 1-2 mm lower than the left side. The maxilla is AP deficient by about 4 mm. The chin actually has fairly good AP projection. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has very thin gingiva on the labial surfaces of her lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She is fairly close to being Class I, and, in fact, may be just slightly Class II cuspid on the right side by 1-2 mm, and on the left side, she is probably about 4-5 mm Class III. She has a severe vertical overbite relationship. She has an anterior and right posterior crossbite beginning with the right central incisor back through the second molar. Oropharyngeal airway structures look normal. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum looks relatively straight. There could be mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction. Columella is somewhat wide and nostrils are slightly narrow. To palpation, she has quite high level of 8 pain over the TMJs, 7 over the right styloid area, 6 over the right shoulder, and relatively mild tenderness over the masseters, right SCM, and moderate over the left posterior neck. Maximal opening is 35 mm. She describes what sounds like a closed lock in the right joint. Excursion movement to the right is 3 mm, to left 5 mm. On opening, she has a definite click in the left joint at about 15 mm of opening and a closing click at about 10 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows that she has 4 impacted third molars. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear quite large. Coronal view shows that she has a significantly deviated septum back in the bony area off towards the left side. Turbinates are large, particularly the right one which appears to obliterate most of the nasal airway. Axial view shows the sinuses appear reasonably clear. The right turbinate is extremely large and appears to fill most of the nasal airway. Left TMJ sagittal tomogram shows condyle that appears elongated throughout the head and neck area compared to the opposite. There is a little bit of anterior beaking. Joint space may be a little bit decreased. Articular eminence is moderately steep.
Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle with reasonably good morphology. There appears to be reasonably vertical good joint space. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.
Left TMJ coronal view shows that the lateral rim of the condyle curves inferiorly probably a good 4 mm. There is close approximation of the condyle to the lateral rim of the fossa. Joint space seems decreased. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears shorter in vertical height as compared to the opposite side. There is significantly decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably a good 4-5 mm. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class III relationship and a Class III cuspid relationship. She has an end-on incisor relationship. Vertical height of the mandible appears to be fairly level. Oropharyngeal airway is actually greater than normal.

Basic diagnoses for B163 would be as follows:
Left mandibular condylar hyperplasia.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation with reduction on the left side and nonreducing closed lock situation on the right side. Mandible deviated prognathism. Maxillary AP hypoplasia.
Class III occlusion on the left side, Class I on the right.
Crossbite in the right side.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Deviated nasal septum.
Nasal airway obstruction.
Impacted third molars x4.
Significant sleep disorder. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Medication: Klonopin 0.5-mg tablets 1 hour prior to bedtime.
MRI.
Presurgical orthodontics. Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Surgery. Left mandibular high condylectomy. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to shift the mandible back on the facial midline. Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.
Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

I gave her prescription for Klonopin 0.5-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet 1 hour before bedtime, refill x5.
B163 MRI AGE: 15/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width and appears somewhat larger than the opposite side in mediolateral as well as vertical dimensions. Superior joint space appears decreased particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Cortical bone appears intact but very thin. Lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm. Disc appears to be medially displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Superior joint space appears to be less than the opposite side. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. It is difficult to identify discal tissue.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly normal appearing architecture, although the condylar head and neck themselves appear elongated. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There could be some slight anterior beaking at the lateral aspect of the condyle. It appears that the articular disc is in relatively normal position. There could be posteriorly displaced articular discs on the left side. Translation is very restricted.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. Joint space is narrow. However, there does appear to be discal tissue present, although the disc is very thin. On opening, there is reasonably good translation of this joint compared to the opposite side.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ possible condylar hyperplasia with possible posterior disc displacement. Right TMJ medial displacement of the articular disc.
