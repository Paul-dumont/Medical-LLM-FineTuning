B012
B012 is 17 years old. She is currently under orthodontic followup with XXXX. About 4 to 5 years ago, B012 began developing headaches that were apparently described as migraines. She went to see a neurologist and nothing could be identified. She is not aware of having noises though within her jaw joints. She did have a T&A, tonsils and adenoidectomy, approximately 0 years ago. She was in orthodontic treatment from about the age of 10 through 16. She had her wisdom teeth removed 3 months ago. She apparently has had a shift in her bite where she could posture her mandible forward into a good occlusion, but in centric would be a more Class II. An x-ray taken by XXX 7 years and 11 months ago which showed that she did have a skeletal Class II relationship at that time.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. The maxillary midline may be about 0.5 mm off to the left side. The mandibular dental midline and chin are pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, she has some increased fullness in the upper lip down low, although subnasale may be just slightly deficient. Chin appears AP deficient by probably 12 to 15 mm. She has a tendency to posture her head and neck forward. Chin neckline is a little bit shorter, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. She has a prominent labial mental fold. The nasal labial angle is acute. Intraorally, B012 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. The teeth appear a little bit flattened, particularly in the molar area. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a Class II end-on occlusion and is probably 3 to 4 mm Class II. She has a vertical overbite of about 1.5 mm. She is about 4 mm Class II bilaterally. She has a slight tendency towards a cross bite in centric relation in the second molar on the right side. She has an anterior over bite of 1.5 mm and an overjet of about 3 to 3 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues all look relatively normal. Tonsils are gone. It is actually a little difficult to see in the oropharyngeal airway. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum deviates a little bit towards the left and then may be off to the right. There is probably mild to moderate nasal airway blockage. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. She rates her headaches at a level of 7 and they occur predominantly in frontal and anterior temporal area. She claims to have no pain directly in the jaw joints, but rates her average daily pain around the head and neck area at 5. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability at 0. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 50 mm, excursion movements about 8 mm in each direction. She has no tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area including the TMJs.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses appear relatively clear. She appears to have arthritis in both joints. Waters view shows that there is some slight deviation from side to side in the bony septum. Turbinates appear fairly large particularly in the right side. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows that she has her mandible postured forward. There appears to be loss of vertical condylar dimension. Articular eminence is actually relatively flat. The mandible is being postured forward. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is postured forward also with increased superior and posterior joint space just as on the other side. Articular eminence is somewhat flat. There is evidence of loss of vertical volume of the condyle. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles. In forward direction, arthritis is seen on the condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she is postured forward. She still has significant adenoid tissue in the nasopharyngeal area with virtually only 1 mm of airway space between the turbinates and the adenoid tissue. At the soft palate level, the airway is only about at the most 4 mm and at the base of the tongue it is only about 4 to 5 mm. She has a moderately high occlusal plane angle. Transversely, the maxilla is fairly level. She has a mild tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 1.5 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B012 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis (AICR versus connective tissue autoimmune disease). AP mandibular hypoplasia. Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. Transverse maxillary hypoplasia. Class II end-on occlusion. High occlusal plane angle. Headaches.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway of 4 mm (normal 11 mm).
Hypertrophied turbinates. Hypertrophied nasopharyngeal adenoid tissue. Nasal airway obstruction. Sleep apnea symptoms.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
MRI of left and right TMJ. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Try to tip the molars slightly lingually.
CT scan if total joint prostheses are necessary for reconstruction. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Bilateral TMJ total joint prostheses for TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to provide counterclockwise rotation of the maxillary and mandibular complex. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
Bilateral coronoidotomies. Partial turbinectomies. Nasopharyngeal adenoidectomy.
5. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B012 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has moderate mediolateral width and evidence of vertical and mediolateral loss of volume. Joint space actually looks reasonably good, but discal tissues seem to be anteromedially displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact across the top of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that may be just slightly wider in width than the left side. There appears to be actually increased joint space vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. The discal tissue appears to be anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost vertical volume. Anteroposteriorly, it may be a little bit narrow. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced. The disc is short anteroposteriorly with almost complete loss of intermediate zone. The disc is extremely short and it may be difficult to adequately cover the condyle. In open view, there is fairly good translation of the left condyle. The articular disc, however, remains anteriorly displaced without reduction and maintains it severe deformation.

Left TMJ T2 films show fluid in the superior joint space. It appears there may be an erosion in the head of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Again, the disc is quite short anteroposteriorly.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows increased vertical joint space superiorly, posteriorly, and anteriorly. Articular eminence is slightly steeper than the opposite side. There is anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly. Most of the intermediate zone is absent. There is significant flattening on the anterior head of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint. In the right TMJ, there is a little bit more restriction in the opening views, but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. In the right TMJ, there appears to be kind of a morphis mass in the superior joint space between the condyle and the fossa and the articular eminence.

Right T2 film shows a little bit of fluid in the anterior aspect of the superior joint space. The disc seems to be significantly degenerated and perhaps a little bit more degenerated than the opposite side.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ condylar resorption and articular disc anteriorly dislocated without reduction with significant degenerative changes of the disc. The findings are compatible with AICR.
