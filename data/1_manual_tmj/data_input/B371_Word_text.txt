B371 
B371 is 21 years old and referred by Dr. _.
Patient History

B371 is in good health with no major medical problems. She takes no medications. She has some allergies to dust, molds, cats, and a few things like that. B371 's problems began at about the age of 13 and occurred during orthodontic treatment, which may be just a coincidental factor. She also was going through pubertal growth development. There is no known etiology for the onset of the problems except she was in orthodontic treatment at the time. She gets occasional earaches, tinnitus, and rarely vertigo. She has some allergies to dust, etc. No jewelry problems. She does have nocturnal bruxism. She does sleep on her back and side most of the time.

Patient Concerns
The primary concerns that she has at this time include the following:
Headaches TMJ pain
Earaches Difficulty eating and chewing
Some difficulties breathing through her nose
Mouth breathing particularly when she sleeps

She gets occasional headaches. She rates them at a level of 6, and they occur predominantly in the temporal and posterior head area. She gets those only about once a month now but used to get them daily prior to having her third molars removed. Following removal of her third molars, this did help reduce her headaches. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, overall pain at 2, jaw function at 7, diet at 5, and disability at 4.

Clinical Evaluation
In frontal view, B371 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all fairly close to being on the facial midline.

In profile view, B371 has some AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 4 mm. Chin is AP deficiency by approximately 20 mm. Lower third face is elongated. Chin-neckline is short, and chin-neck angle is not well defined.

Intraorally, B371 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Some significant rotations particular of the left second molar. She has some significant crowding, lower anterior arch. Cuspids are blocked out of the arch, and there is probably at least 8 to 9 mm of crowding present in the lower anterior arch. She appears to have adequate attached gingiva.

In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. In centric relation, she is fairly close to being in a full Class II occlusion. Overjet is 10 mm, and she has an anterior open-bite of probably about 2 mm. In a Class I position, she has crossbites posteriorly. She maintains about a 3-mm open bite as she postures forward in a Class I position. She has significant transverse maxillary deficiency. Oropharynx appears clear. Tonsils are quite small. Uvula is normal size. Intranasally, turbinates are moderately enlarged, particularly on the right side. This could be causing some airway obstruction. Holding the nostrils open did not alter her abilities to breathe through her nose at all.

Maximal incisal opening is 40 mm, excursive movement to right 3 mm and to the left 8 mm. Joints seem to function actually relatively smoothly. She had some mild tenderness to palpation over the masseter muscles, medial pterygoids, TMJs, and styloid areas.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Has a root canal in the maxillary right central incisor. All other teeth are present and accounted for. Condyles look a little bit flattened and a little bit short with the left side condyle appearing a little bit smaller than the right side. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit short in vertical height. Appears to be a large pseudocyst internally. Good joint space around it. May not have been all the way back in centric occlusion when this x-ray was taken. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be a little bit shorter vertically. Good joint space present. Condyle may be postured forward, and she may not have been in centric relation when the x-ray was taken. Some anterior beaking appears to be present. Joint space, however, appears relatively good.

Translation shows that there are some limited transitory capabilities bilaterally. Left side may translate just slightly more than the right side. Anterior beaking on the right condyle is quite obvious on the open view.

Waters view shows that the sinuses all appear to be clear. Turbinate on the right side appears quite large compared to the left side. Facial structures look fairly symmetric in a vertical orientation.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows significant retrusion of the mandible and high occlusal plane angle, particularly in the lower arch. There is a decreased oropharyngeal airway with the distance from the base of the tongue to the posterior pharyngeal wall measuring about 3.5 mm (normal 11 mm). At the soft palate level, the disc measures about 6 mm. Lower incisors may be in a little bit of a vertical orientation. Tooth-size analysis reveals no significant tooth-size discrepancy.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption versus reactive arthritis but with articular disc dislocations without reduction and significant deformation of the discs
AP maxillary deficiency
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency
Transverse maxillary deficiency
AP mandibular deficiency
Class II occlusion
Anterior open bite
Occluding only on the maxillary and mandibular second molars with all other teeth out of occlusion
Significant crowding, lower anterior arch, of probably 9 mm
Mild crowding, upper anterior arch
Bilateral posterior crossbites, particularly when the models were placed in a Class I relationship
High occlusal plane angulation
Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of only 3.5 mm at tongue base and approximately 4 mm at the soft palate level
Headaches TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Hypertrophied turbinates
Nasal airway obstruction
Earaches

Recommended Treatment
Extract maxillary second bicuspids and mandibular second bicuspids
Presurgical orthodontics
Align and level maxillary arch, closing the extraction space. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies that will be necessary at surgery.
Align and level mandibular arch, closing the extraction space.

CAT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol) of the TMJs and jaws
Surgery
Bilateral TMJ condylectomies, meniscectomies, debridement, reconstruction, and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, downgraft it posteriorly, and expand it.
Bilateral coronoidectomies.
Fat graft to bilateral TMJs (harvested from abdomen).
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B371  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition:	
Date of Reading:	
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is narrow mediolaterally to a certain extend. The bone is a little bit uneven on top of the condyle, although it appears that the cortex is intact. Condyle appears a little shortened vertically. Joint space is a little bit decreased medially but otherwise looks fairly good. It appears that the disc is anteriorly displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount, approximately 4 mm, but there appears to be reasonably good lateral joint space.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Cortical bone appears intact on the condyle. The condyle appears short vertically. Cortical bone of the fossa appears intact. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly approximately 4 mm. Joint space looks fairly good. It appears that the discal tissue is anteriorly position.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some erosion in the midportion of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Some small osteophytic projections extending up in the condylar head in the midportion. Fossa appears to be intact. Articular eminence is moderately steep and somewhat elongated. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly foreshortened anteroposteriorly. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle, and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with fairly good anteroposterior dimension but with anterior beaking. Cortical bone appears to be intact in the condylar head. Condyle appears a little bit short vertically. Articular eminence is moderately steep and a little bit elongated. Joint space appears fairly adequate. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly foreshortened and deformed. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. Could be an inflammatory process around the posterior head of the condyle.

On opening, there is moderately good translation better than the opposite side, but articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.
