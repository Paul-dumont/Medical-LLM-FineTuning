B312 
B312 is 19 years old.
Patient History
She has had previous surgeries around the head area including an osseous genioplasty and some work on her turbinates to try to improve her nasal airway, which has not been very successful. She also has a lot of stomach pains and has seen Dr. __ earlier today in reference to those problems. Dr. __ has planned to do some additional testing while B312 is here in Dallas to try to figure out the stomach problems for her. She had a previous problem with a seizure and took medications for about four years but is now not taking any medicines and is having no problems. She is taking two medications, Clariflu and Zinnat, which is an antibiotic.

B312 has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain, earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, nor is she aware of any noises in her jaw joints.
Patient Concerns
Difficulties breathing through her nose
Esophageal gurgling (she is seeing Dr. __ in reference to this)
Teeth do not fit together in the front

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B312 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is 5 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is just about a millimeter to the left. Nasal tip is about a millimeter or two to the right. Chin is pretty much on the facial midline.

In profile, B312 may have just some slight AP maxillary deficiency but not too significant. Lower third face appears a little bit long. Chin is just slightly retruded. Chin-neckline may be a little bit short, but chin-neck angle is well defined.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. Still has the mamelons on her lower anterior teeth. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower anterior arch. Has adequate attached gingiva in the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has a good Class I cuspid-molar relationship on the right side and on the left side just a slight tendency toward Class II but not too significant. Has almost an end-on incisor relationship and 0 overbite relationship. In the oropharynx, everything looks pretty clear except she has a small soft tissue lesion at the posterior aspect of the soft palate adjacent to the uvula that measures probably about 4 mm x 4 mm. It is nonirritated and nonfirm.

Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged and seem to constrict the nasal airway. The base of the columella appears somewhat wide. When using the nasal scope inside the nose and opening her nares on each side, it made her breathing much easier.

To palpation, she had no really significant myofascial pain although a little bit of tenderness in the styloid area at about a level of 3. TMJs were nontender to palpation and seemed to function reasonably smoothly.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars but all of the rest of the teeth are present. She has three screws in the chin area from the previous chin surgery. A 3 x 3 retainer is seen on the lower anterior teeth. Sinuses appear relatively clear, although she may have a mucocele in the left maxillary sinus. Turbinates appear enlarged. Septum looks fairly straight. Condyles as best as can be seen look relatively normal. Seems to have an excessive distance from the apices of the teeth to the base of the nose. Sinuses come down and extend down below the levels of the root apices.

Waters view shows the left sinus appears to be a little bit more cloudy than the right sinus. Other sinuses appear relatively clear. Septum may be a little bit deviated. Turbinates appear enlarged particularly on the right side. Jaws look relatively symmetric.

Left TMJ tomogram shows condyles that appear fairly normal although there appears to be a little bit of a pseudocyst on the condylar head. Appears to be decreased joint space vertically. Posterior joint space looks pretty good.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that also appears to have sort of a pseudocyst on the condylar head. Decreased joint space vertically and posteriorly with appearance of some calcification behind the condylar head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space vertically looks a little bit better on one view but in another view it looks quite narrow.

Translation is very good in both joints. In the open view, there appears to be perhaps some flattening on the head of the condyle on the right side.
Cephalometrically, she has a high occlusal plane angle and evidence of a previous chin procedure. She has a huge adenoidal mass in her posterior nasopharynx and only has about a 2-mm airway space between the adenoid tissue and the posterior aspect of the turbinates. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the soft palate is about 4 mm and at the base of the tongue is about 4.5 mm. There is about a 3-mm tooth-size discrepancy.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations (to be verified by MRI)
Vertical maxillary hyperplasia
AP mandibular hypoplasia
Slight II occlusion on the left side, Class I on the right side
End-on incisor relationship
Hypertrophied turbinates
Hypertrophied nasopharyngeal adenoid tissue
Wide columella base
Nasal airway obstruction
Decreased oropharyngeal airway
Soft tissue lesion in the right soft palate/uvula area (5 mm x 5 mm)
High occlusal plane angulation
Significant tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3 mm
Overangulation of the lower incisors

Recommended Treatment
MRI of left and right TMJs
Presurgical orthodonics
Align and level maxillary arch but place a step in the upper arch wire to align the four incisors at an elevated plane level compared to the cuspids and the posterior teeth. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm or possibly 3 mm of tooth structure and close the spacing

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors (only if articular discs are shown to be displaced on the MRI)
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly, level the occlusal plane, and re-establish a normal anterior overbite relationship
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction to aid in opening the oropharyngeal airway
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies
Nasopharyngeal adenoidectomy
Remove lesion from soft palate/uvula area

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
Conversation with Dr. __: He feels that she has reflux, abdominal pain, and perhaps even gallstones. He plans to do a cine esophagogram, upper GI series, and a sonogram to look for gallstones. He wanted to alert me of the lesion above the vocal cords which is actually the lesion on her soft palate/uvula area. He said that when we do her surgery, if she goes ahead with it, he may want to do a scope on her at the same time when she is asleep. We could certainly arrange this.

B312 MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition:	
Date of Reading:	
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa appears to curve inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm. Joint space appears significantly decreased particularly out laterally. May be some evidence of discal tissue medially positioned. May be some slight rough areas on the coronal head but difficult to tell.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. Decreased joint space superiorly and laterally. Difficult to determine where the discal tissue is but may be medial.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some flattening on the anterior head. Some superior peaking present with a little bit of sclerosis. Posterior joint space is decreased. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced, but it appears to have reasonably good architecture yet. No significant inflammation seen around the joint.

On opening, there is good translation of the disc, and the disc does appear to reduce.
Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that demonstrates a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and some significant thinness of the cortical bone in a couple of views. Slightly decreased posterior joint space. Superior joint space appears somewhat decreased. Out laterally, the disc appears to be in a more vertical orientation. I believe the disc is anteriorly displaced particularly at the lateral aspect.

On opening, there is fairly good translation. The disc appears to be in position.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Both discs appear to be salvageable
