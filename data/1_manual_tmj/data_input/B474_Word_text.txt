B474 
B474 is 57 years old and is referred by Dr. XX. The only previous surgery she has had is a hysterectomy.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:
Verapamil 230 mg for BP.
Diovan 160 mg for BP.
Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.
Climara patch for hormone replacement.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
TMJ and jaw problems.
Neck problems.
Lower jaw tends to shift forward.
Headaches. TMJ problems.

B474 states that her problems began when she was about 35 years old back 23 years ago. She had orthodontic treatment at that time. She had an end-on Class III occlusal relationship and orthodontic appliances were applied and probably some significant elastics to try to correct her Class III occlusion. She was told that it may or may not work. She had begun developing neck problems. 12 years ago, she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained a whiplash injury which did not help her circumstances at all. Over the years she has had multiple splints. She has had physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, rolfing, extensive dental reconstruction, with subsequent removal of the dental buildups. At one point she had extensive buildup of her teeth to make them taller but then she lost her freeway space and then when she would talk or try to function her teeth would hit together. The buildups were then ground back down again. She feels she has a problem of the lower jaw tending to want to shift forward.

She rates her TMJ pain at 6, headaches that she gets occasionally in the temple area at 6, average daily pain at 5, jaw function 7, diet at 6, disability at 7. She has no problems with earaches or tinnitus but has mild difficulties with vertigo but no hearing loss. The only other joints that really bother her are her cervical vertebrae. She does experience significant problems with limited energy. Her jaws feel tired and weak frequently. She does get quivering at night of her jaws and chin area unless she takes the Ambien and this helps settle the muscle problems. When B474 had the crowns cut back down that were built up excessively, the pain in her neck decreased and made her feel somewhat better. However, she still continues to have problems through the jaw area particularly the masseter muscle areas and with her bite being off.

In frontal view, B474 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about -2 mm. Maxillary, mandibular and chin midlines are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, B474  has fairly good facial balance and symmetry. B474  has all of her lower teeth back through the second molar on the right side and through the second bicuspid on the left side. She has spacing between the lower anterior teeth. She has 2 implants in the left first and second molar area.  

In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an end-on incisor relationship with basically a Class I cuspid, slight Class III molar relationship on the right side and the same on the left side. She has gingival retraction around the anterior teeth with the cuspids forward a little bit on the molars. She has multiple diastemas between the lower anterior teeth. Apparently, these spaces have been closed up 2 or 3 times and were bonded but she tends to keep pushing against those lower front teeth until they come back out again and the bonding gives. Intranasally, the turbinates look relatively normal. The septum appears within normal limits and there does not appear to be any obvious nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, she has high moderate discomfort to palpation of the styloid areas, TMJs, masseter and low to severe tenderness over a couple of areas in the temporalis muscles. The right TMJ seems to function relatively smoothly. The left TMJ actually produces significant crepitus on opening. Maximal incisal opening is 45 mm. Opening without significant discomfort is 25 mm. Excursive movements are about 10 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. She has implants replacing the mandibular left first and second molars and maxillary first and second molars. Also, she has an implant on the right side replacing the first bicuspid. She has a pontic replacing the first molar with the size of a bicuspid crown. She has root canal in the maxillary left lateral incisor. She also has a root canal on the left second bicuspid. The sinuses appear clear. The condyles look fairly reasonably.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear and turbinates are normal in size and bony septum appears fairly straight.
Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with a slight hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There could be a little bit of anterior beaking present. Joint space appears of reasonable size.

Left TMJ tomogram show what appears to be decreased posterior joint space. Superior joint space appears somewhat decreased. Articular eminence is normal in size and shape. On opening, there is adequate translation of both joints. In the opening view, the right condyle appears fairly flat on top.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has basically a skeletal Class I position but with dental alveolar protrusion of the lower anterior arch. She appears to be fairly close to being a Class II cuspid relationship. Oropharyngeal airway looks adequate although just slightly constricted.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated predominately in a medial direction. Mandibular hyperplasia.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain. 

Missing mandibular left first and second molars with implants placed but all the other teeth are present either in the form of natural teeth, natural teeth with crowns, or crowns on the implants. She has a total of 5 osseointegrated implants. Edge-on incisor relationship.
Class I cuspid relationship.
Multiple diastemas of the lower anterior teeth. Over angulation of lower anterior teeth.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Place temporary crowns on the mandibular left first and second molars.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch closing up the spacing in the lower anterior arch.
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors and probable arthroplasties.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to set the mandible posterior and into a maximal occlusal relationship.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Dental reconstruction.

B474  MRI Evaluation  
Age: 57/F
DOB:  
Date of Acquisition:  
Date of Interpretation:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is some irregularity on the head of the condyle. Decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint with what appears to be almost bone-on-bone contact. There appears to be discal tissue displaced medially and anteriorly. The condyle appears to have a medial extension of the condylar head with decreased joint space in that area as well.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good width with medial extension of the condyle. There is decreased joint space vertically particularly at the lateral rim of the fossa where there could be bone-on-bone contact as well as over medially. It appears there could be some discal tissue within the joint area that is displaced medially.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some flattening on the anterior head and sclerosis there as well. A little superior peaking of the condyle and a little bit of anterior beaking. Articular eminence has relatively normal inclination. Out laterally, the disc is not seen until the mid portion of the condyle. Over medially, the disc appears to be in good position. There is a decreased joint space particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint but the posterior joint space is a little bit better towards the medial side. There could be a little bit of fluid in the joint spaces but nothing significant. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the articular disc appears to reduce and also have good translation.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening and little bit of anterior beaking. A little bit of sclerosis at the head of the condyle but not too much. At the lateral aspect of the joint it appears that the articular disc is not readily seen but when it does become visible it appears to be anteriorly displaced. Towards the middle and the medial aspect of the joint, the disc appears to be in a more normal position. Out laterally, there is a significantly decreased joint space, but over medially the posterior joint space is better balanced. Out laterally there is significantly decreased joint space. On opening, there is good translation and the disc appears to reduce into position.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc medially displaced with some anterior displacement towards the lateral aspect of the joint but with reduction on opening.
