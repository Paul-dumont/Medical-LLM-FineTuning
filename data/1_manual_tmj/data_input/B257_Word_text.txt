I evaluated records that were sent and photographs. Frontal view shows that she has fairly good left to right facial balance. Midlines appear to be reasonably well aligned. Upper lip length and tooth-to-lip relationship looks relatively normal. Lateral view shows that the maxilla may be slightly retruded but the mandible and chin are significantly retruded. She has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship with some moderate crowding in both the upper and lower arch. There appears to be somewhat of a reverse curve of Wilson in the upper arch perhaps moreso in the bicuspid area. Upper cuspids are blocked partially out the arch.

B257 became aware last year when she was 18. She apparently has clicking and popping in her jaw joints. She also has pain in both joints. She gets headaches about 5 times per week usually in the afternoon of moderate to severe intensity. They occur frequently. They are in the forehead area. She does have some neck pain. She is aware of clenching her teeth at night. She has had problems with occasional earaches primarily on the right side that are mild. She gets some moderate occurrences of ringing in her ears and occasional lightheadedness. Other joints that bother her include her knees. She rates her TMJ pain at 7, headaches at 8 average daily pain at 5. She rates her jaw function at 7 and disability at 8. She does carry herself in a head postured forward neck position. She has no problems with snoring nor sleep apnea. She has some mild daytime tiredness.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Pain through the jaw areas, head and neck.
Poor jaw function.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
She apparently had some grating type of sounds in both her joints. She has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology. MRI substantiates that she has displaced articular disc and possibly ICR.

TOMOGRAMS:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle has fairly good shape and morphology. Decreased vertical joint space is present indicative of disc dislocation.

Right TMJ coronal view shows that there has been a lot of loss of condylar volume and condylar height. Joint space may be a little bit decreased but not as much as the opposite side.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows flattening of the anterior head with a little bit of anterior beaking present. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Some superior peaking on the condyle. Articular eminence is normal shape and angulation. Decreased posterior joint space and superior joint space.

B257  Page 2
Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has definitely lost vertical height. There is skipping out of the condyle. Decreased posterior joint space but superior joint space appears slightly increased. Anterior beaking is present. Superior peaking is present towards the posterior head of the condyle. Axial view shows that the turbinate appears enlarged although the one view we have the septum looks fairly straight. Maxillary sinuses look clear.

Panorex evaluation shows that she has impacted third molars x4. She has root canal on maxillary left first molar. Both condyles look arthritic with the left one looking a little bit sclerotic and a little resorbed anteriorly whereas the right one lost vertical dimension appears a little bit scooped out.

Lateral cephalometric x-rays are over-enlarged and the head is tilted up considerably. I suspect that she has a high occlusal plane angle skeletal Class II relationship and perhaps just a slight Class II end-on occlusal relationship. There is an overjet of about 1 to 2 mm. Oropharyngeal airway actually looks fairly good but this in part might be due to the fact that her head is tipped up so much. Lower incisors appear somewhat over-angulated. BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation with possible ICR versus CT/AI disease that could be causing the condylar resorption or it could be a reactive arthritis.
AP mandibular deficiency. Slight AP maxillary deficiency. Probable posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. High occlusal plane angle.
Class II end-on occlusal relationship. Hypertrophied turbinates.
Partial nasal airway obstruction.
AP microgenia. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of approximately 2.5 mm. Impacted third molars x4.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
MRI of left and right TMJs.
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2.5 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth size discrepancy.

RE: B257  Page 3
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors (will be pending MRI findings.)
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward and downgraft it posteriorly.
Consider augmentation genioplasty.
Surgical removal of 4 impacted third molars. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B257 
Telephone conversation with _____. He had called in reference to her orthodontics. I told him he does not need to open spaces between the upper laterals and cuspids, just to be sure the roots on the laterals are tipped mesially and cuspids tipped distally. Also, he has not slenderized the lower anterior teeth yet as requested, and he will do that. He is to remove 2 to 2.5 mm of tooth structure. I answered all the questions he had at this time. He will send some models when he feels everything is ready.

B257 
Telephone conversation with Dr. ___. Apparently, tooth #14 has had previous endodontic treatment but now appears to be reinfected. The recommendation is to re-treat the tooth to eliminate the infection before we do our jaw surgery or have the tooth removed so that it will not be a liability at the time of surgery. If it is infected, it needs to be extracted and then it can be replaced with an implant.

B257 
The patient presents for presurgical evaluation. This is the first I have had an opportunity to see her clinically. Upper lip length is 25 mm. Tooth lip relationship is 3 mm. Maxillary midline is shifted off to the right side 1 mm and the chin shifted off to the right side about 3 to 4 mm. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 2 mm higher than the left side. In profile, she has some slight AP deficiency in the maxilla by about 2 to 3 mm, and the chin appears deficient by about 15 to 18 mm. She has a head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, she has a Class II end-on occlusion with the maxillary midline 1 mm off to the right side. She has severely hypertrophied tonsils where they almost touch the midline. She gets frequent sore throats and tonsillitis. She rates her headaches at a level of 7, TMJ pain about a level of 6, jaw function at around 7, diet at 5, and disability at 8. Maximum incisal opening is about 28 mm and excursion movement to the right 3 mm, to the left about 6 mm. To palpation, she has mild tenderness over the temporalis, masseters, mandibular pterygoids, and right styloid area. Intranasally, she has moderately enlarged turbinates and a deviated septum off to the right side with partial nasal airway obstruction. She is aware of clenching and bruxing her teeth at night. She has a glitch in the right TMJ at about 25 mm of opening and on closing a glitch at about 20 mm.

Her history and physical has been performed and consent form reviewed and signed. I added the hypertrophied tonsils in the diagnosis and tonsillectomy in the surgical section. I completed my final examination. I answered all the questions that she and her mother had. She is ready for surgery tomorrow.

Diagnoses:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction (probably AICR).
AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. AP mandibular deficiency.
AP microgenia.
Class II end-on occlusion. High occlusal plane angle.
Impacted third molars x4.
Severely hypertrophied tonsils.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Deviated nasal septum off to the right side.
Nasal airway obstruction.
Belopharyngeal incompetency with hypernasal speech quality secondary to hypertrophied tonsils.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics completed. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superior slightly and the posterior aspect inferiorly. Transversely level the occlusion.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to augment chin. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
Bilateral tonsillectomy.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomy.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

The patient presents for followup evaluation. She is doing very well. She is now 1 year post surgery. She has no headaches, no TMJ pain, no pain around the head and neck area except for some tenderness over the right masseter. Otherwise, she has no pain or tenderness. She rates her jaw function at 3, diet at 1, disability at 0. Incisal opening is 39 mm (pre-surgery it was 28 mm). Excursion movement to the right 4 mm, to the left 5 mm. Occlusion is very good. She got her braces off. The only medication she takes is her birth control pills. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, nor hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her knees. She is aware of clenching at night time and she sometimes wakes up a little bit sore in the morning. Therefore, I gave her a prescription for Klonopin 1-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x5. She is to call me in a couple of week and let me know how she is doing. She is doing very well and to return to see me in the future if she is in the Dallas area. B257 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. Postsurgical x-rays were taken. She is doing very well except she is still a little bit nauseated today. She has some significant edema. Occlusion is good. Airway looks good. I did suction out her nasal airway. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. Pain medicine is working reasonably for well. She is progressing well and to return to see me in 2 days.

B257 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. Occlusion is good. I placed an additional Class II elastic on the left side. Edema is moderate. She had a little nausea episode while she was here, but not too badly. I removed her sutures today. I suctioned out her nose. The yeast infection appears to be clearing nicely and she is to continue on the Nystatin medication. She is doing well with no evidence of infection. She is to return to see me in 1 day.

B257 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. She is feeling much better today and not as nauseated. I suctioned out her nose and got a lot of material out particularly on the left side. She could breath much better afterwards. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. Occlusion looks fairly good. She is progressing nicely. Moderate edema. She is to return to see me in 1 day.

B257 
B257 is doing very well. I changed out her elastics. Her occlusion is good. Airway is good. I suctioned her nose. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She is in good spirits. Feeling much better today. She is headed to the mall. She is to return to see me tomorrow.

B257 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing well. I suctioned out her nose, but there is not much there today. Occlusion is good with the elastics that are currently in position. There are no particular concerns or problems at this time. I gave her jaw exercises to do. She is progressing well and to return tomorrow to see Dr. ___ as I will be out of town and then return on Monday to see me.

B257 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion is significantly improved. Having no real significant concerns or problems at this time. I suctioned out her nose and got a lot of mucus out. She is breathing well, is in good spirits, and edema is significantly decreased. She is doing well and to return to see me in 1 day. B257 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion is good with just a light Class II elastic on the left side. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. I suctioned her airway with much less return today as compared to yesterday. She knows how to blow her nose. She is leaving to return home early tomorrow morning. I gave her a prescription for Percocet 7.5/325, dispensing 10 tablets, 1 tablet q. 6 to 8 hours p.r.n. pain. I answered all the questions she and her mother had at this time. She is progressing well and to return to see me in 3 months.

Axial views only are available. She has a large left turbinate. Right turbinate looks relatively normal in size. Septum appears straight. Not all the maxillary sinus is exposed, but it appears clear. The condyles appear to have good mediolateral width and also appear to have good AP width. Oropharyngeal airway appears to be constricted mediolaterally.

Impression based on this CAT scan would be left inferior turbinate hyperplasia.
B257  I-CAT
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of an erosion on the medial side of the condyle. Lateral joint space looks good, but the medial joint space appears a little bit narrow.

Right TMJ coronal view shows that there appears to be decreased vertical joint space. There is some joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint near the superior part towards the anterior aspect of the condyle. Posterior, however, there appears to be decreased joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic with a little flattening on the head and a little anterior beaking, but for the most part there appears to be fairly good joint space with a Mitek anchor in proper position.

In the right TMJ, there appears to be arthritic changes and almost bone-on-bone contact at the posterior aspect of the fossa. Mitek anchor appears to be in place. She appears to have full sinuses. Oropharyngeal airway appears quite good. Nasal airway appears open.

B257 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. She is now 4 months post surgery. Progressing very well. Occlusion is slight Class II on the left side and just very minor Class II on the right side. I placed a single Class II elastic on the right side and triple Class III elastics on the left side and let this sit for about an hour. This seemed to have corrected the problem. I weaned her to 2 elastics on the left side, but maintained the one on the right side.

She has hypersensitivity to the mandibular left first bicuspid. It may be related to elastics, but she also has the cuspid root and the bicuspid root almost touching. There does not seem to be any cavity or periodontal problem associated with that tooth. It may be in slight hyper-function. There are concerns in reference to the right TMJ. She does have some arthritic changes and it appears that the disc may be out of place, but at this time she is asymptomatic. We will continue to observe that joint and see how it progresses. Occlusion is actually looking fairly good. She is progressing well. I will do a letter to her orthodontist. She is to return to see me in October for a year followup. B257  MRI 
AGE: DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some significant flattening in the anterior head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed. It is quite short anteroposteriorly with significant loss of intermediate zone. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. The disc is sitting fairly close to being beneath the articular eminence. On opening, the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction, although there is moderately good translation of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit more degenerated than the left side. There is some extreme flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and a little bit of anterior beaking and a little superior peaking of the condyle. Articular eminence is a little bit more shallow in this side than the opposite side. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. It is distorted and deformed. It is quite short anteroposteriorly with virtually no intermediate zone. There is some minimal fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the condyle translates reasonably well, but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little narrow mediolaterally, but not too bad. There is decreased superior joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the rim. There is about a 2 to 3 mm downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. The articular disc is medially displaced as well as anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant degenerative changes with significant loss of vertical dimension. The lateral rim of the fossa is a little bit flatter than the opposite side. There is decreased superior joint space. The disc appears to be anteriorly positioned.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially dislocated without reduction. Right TMJ severe arthritis with loss of vertical dimension and a disc that is anteriorly displaced without reduction. .
