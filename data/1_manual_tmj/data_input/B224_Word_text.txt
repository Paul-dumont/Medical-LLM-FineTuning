B224
B224 is 15 years old and, referred by Dr. XXXX.
B224 is in good health with no major medical problems.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
1. Bite is shifting.
2. Chronic mouth breather.
3. Significant difficulties breathing through the nose.
4. Severe snoring. He has probably moderate-to-severe snoring.
5. Clicking and popping in the jaw joints.

HISTORY: B224 may get earaches about every 3 months. He gets occasional tinnitus. He gets vertigo only when he is tired. No hearing loss. The only other joints that bother him are his knees. He is not aware of clenching and bruxism. He has some significant nasal airway obstruction. He is probably a mouth breather. He takes no medications. He rates his headaches at a level of 0, TMJ pain at 0, overall facial pain and headaches at 0, jaw function at 0, diet at 1 disability at 0. B224's TMJ problem began about 4 years ago when he was about 11 years of age. Shortly after that, he began his orthodontic treatment and has had 2 orthodontic treatments from the age of 11 years to 15 years. One time he was treated with a twin block and also he had a maxillary expander procedure done.

CLINICAL EVALUATION: On frontal view, B224 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Some deviation of the nose. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 3 mm. Nasal tips off to the right side about 3 mm. Midline is off to the left about 2-1/2 to 3 mm. Mandibular dental midline is probably fairly close to being on the facial midline or maybe just about 1 mm to the left. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are pretty well aligned with the facial midline. In profile view, upper lip superlabrale is posterior to subnasale. The upper lip is probably retruded by about 4 to 6 mm. The chin is retruded by approximately 20 mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short. Chin-neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B224 has all of his lower teeth back to the second molars present. He has adequate attached gingiva though quite thin around the tooth central incisors. Also, thin around the cuspids. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molar. In centric relation, B224 has a Class II malocclusion about 2 mm on the left side and probably 5 to 6 mm on the right side. He has an open-bite tendency from the cuspids forward. He has about a 1 mm vertical overbite, but has an overjet of probably about 4 mm. When B224 bites his teeth together he hits prematurely on the right side. Intraorally, the oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. The uvula is moderately hyperplastic, but the soft palate is normal length and the fascial pillars look relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum appears to be deviated off towards the left side and there is a big spur at the base of the nose. Turbinates on the right side is moderately enlarged and the left side at least anteriorly is of a more normal size. B224 had a nasal injury when he was in his early grade school years where fell off some mats and hit his nose and had some significant bleeding and also hit his head. He was taken to the ER for evaluation at that time. To palpation, he has some mild tenderness over the masseter muscles. On opening, joints seem to function relatively smoothly. On excursion movement there may be a little bit of crepitation. Maximal incisal opening is 53 mm. Excursion movement to the right is about 4 mm, to the left 8 mm. Transverse cant and maxilla are relatively level.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the presence of all four third molars impacted and the lowers are trapped beneath the distal aspect of the crowns on the second molars. Sinuses appear relatively clear as best as be evaluated from these photos.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears narrow anteroposteriorly. Difficult to see the cortical bone across the top of the condyle. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with significantly increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination to it.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is somewhat flattened on top and posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is steeper than the opposite side. It is difficult to identify the cortical bone on top of the condyle, but a little more legible then the opposite side. On opening, there is adequate translation in both joints, but the condyles do not quite clear the articular eminence.

Waters view shows that that the left maxillary sinus is fairly opaque, particularly probably a sinusitis occurring in that sinus at the time. Right sinus is clear. There is significant deviation and a huge septal spur off the left side of the septum that actually goes over and almost touches against the lateral nasal wall. Turbinate on the right appears quite large. Turbinate on the left side is pretty much obliterated by the large septal spur.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows slight anterior vertical maxillary excess and posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. The mandible is AP deficient and there is a skeletal Class II and an occlusal Class II jaw relationship. He has a fairly large adenoid mass in the nasopharynx and an AOA dimension of about 3.5 mm between the turbinate and the adenoid tissue. Airway at the base of the soft palate measures about 6 mm and the base of tongue measures about 7.5 mm. There is no significant tooth size discrepancy.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
1. Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and articular disc dislocations without reduction.
2. AP maxillary deficiency.
3. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
4. AP mandibular deficiency.
5. Class II occlusion.
6. Maxillary midline shifted 2 to 3 mm to the left of the facial midline.
7. Anterior open bite.
8. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
9. Severely deviated nasal septum with large septal spur obliterating the left nasal airway passage.
10. Bilateral hypertrophied turbinates.
11. Nasopharyngeal adenoid hyperplasia.
12. Wide columella creating narrow nostrils.
13. High-occlusal plane angle.
14. Back to maxillary mandibular third molars x4.
15. Sleep apnea symptoms.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
1. Surgery stage I. a. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
2. Monitor facial growth and development.
3. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b. Slenderize lower anterior teeth removing 1 to 2 mm of tooth structure and retract, but be careful not to remove any more than 2 mm of tooth structure.
3. Surgery stage II. a. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxillary superiorly, downward at the posterior aspect, upright the incisors and decrease the occlusal plane angle. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counter-
clockwise direction. c. Nasoseptoplasty. d. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e. Removal of nasopharyngeal adenoid mass. f. Surgical removal of bone impacted third molars.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have perhaps some loss of integrity on the cortical bone underneath the condyle. Quality is either very poor or he is having some significant degenerative changes in the bone structure of the mandibular condyle. Decrease in superior joint space is present. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount. Cortical bone appears somewhat irregular on the head of the condyle. Disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. Appears there may have been some condylar resorption present.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that shows up a little better on the imaging as compared to the opposite side. There is fairly good mediolateral width. Decreased superior joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the condyle and the medial aspect of the condyle. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. Condyle appears somewhat flattened. Appears there may have been some condylar resorption present.

Left TMJ sagittal view show a condyle that appears to have lost some volume and some vertical height. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa and appears to be some loss of vertical height of the joint space. Articular eminence is quite long and moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and actually sitting beneath the articular eminence. Condyle appears to be extremely narrow towards the medial aspect of the joint. It appears small compared to the size of the fossa. Disc is somewhat deformed. It appears to be shortened anteroposteriorly and a little bit thickened. It appears to have lost the intermediate zone. In some areas, there appears to be amorphous tissue in the joint space. On opening, there is significantly restricted translation and the disc appears nonreducing. Disc may be adhesed to the articular eminence.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle is a little bit larger on this side than the opposite side. However, the bone particularly towards the medial side of the joint appears to have resorbed somewhat. Some anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Decreased posterior joint space. This is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Disc is short anteroposteriorly and thickened. There may be amorphous type of material surrounding the condyle. On opening, the condyle has restricted translation although slightly more than the opposite side and the disc remains nonreducing.

IMPRESSION:
1. TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation possibly compatible with ICR. Disc is significantly deformed, but may still be salvable.
2. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with significant deformation. Questionable salvagability though there may be enough there to utilize.
