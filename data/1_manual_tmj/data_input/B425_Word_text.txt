B425 
B425 is 19 years 11 months of age.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Bite has changed significantly.
Occludes predominately only on his back teeth and his front teeth are apart.
Clenching and grinding of the teeth. Clicking and popping of the jaw joints.

B425 had orthodontic treatment when he was about 12 to 13 years of age and apparently had a good bite relationship at that time. He got a blow to the jaw sometime probably during his sophomore year in high school playing soccer. One of his teeth must have gotten knocked out of alignment and he went back in orthodontics for about 6 months to get the teeth aligned back up and only appliances were placed apparently on the upper teeth. The orthodontic work was done by Dr. X and Dr. X in XX. Apparently his bite was good at that time. In the past 2 years, his bite has shifted and opened anteriorly with only biting in the back teeth. B425  has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. He does have some problems with his right knee. He is very much aware of clenching and bruxism at nighttime and sometimes during the day. He has no headache problems, no TMJ pain or myofascial pain around the head and neck area. He rates his jaw function, diet and disability at 0.

In frontal view, B425 has fairly good facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary, mandibular and chin midline are all pretty much aligned on the facial midline. In profile view, B425 has just some slight AP maxillary deficiency. Mandible appears to be retruded by 10 to 12 mm. Chin-neckline is very short although chin-neck angle is fairly well defined. Intraorally, B425 has all his lower teeth back through the second molars. Back teeth are significantly worn. He has ______ all the way up to the first bicuspid on the left side and second bicuspid on the right side. In centric relation, B425 occludes only the second molars on the left and the right side. First molar on the left side might touch a little bit though it is primarily in the second molars and all the other teeth are out of occlusion. He has about a 4 mm anterior open bite. He has a slight Class II occlusal relationship by about 2 mm. He has as Class II end-on occlusion by about 2 mm. He has a posterior crossbite on the left side involving the molars and possibly a little bit the bicuspids. On the right side, there is a tendency towards a crossbite in the first molars and second bicuspid area. Intranasally, the septum is reasonably straight. The right turbinate appears relatively normal in size. The left turbinate is moderately enlarged. There is probably not a significant nasal airway obstruction except perhaps a mild amount on the left side. B425 does snore some. He does have some mild daytime somnolence. He is not aware of any sleep apnea problems. He has no tenderness around the head and neck area to palpation. On opening, the joints function reasonably smoothly but on excursive movements he has popping in the left joint. Maximal incisal opening is 50 mm. Excursive movement to the right 9 mm, left 10 mm. To palpation, he has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Right joint is smooth, left joint has popping in it on excursive movement. Tooth size analysis shows there is a Bolton's difference of 3 mm. 

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Thorax shows the absence of all 4 third molars. Sinuses look clear. Turbinates appear enlarged. Difficult to evaluate the joints but the condyles have a fairly good morphology.

Waters view shows that there is a little bit of curvature in the bony septum with it deviating off towards the right side a little bit. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. Airway appears slightly constricted. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Frontal sinuses are fairly large.

Left TMJ tomogram shows an increased vertical and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is actually fairly steep. There appears to be an open bite present including the first molars on forward. It is possible there may have been some condylar resorption but difficult to determine.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle postured down forward in the fossa. The patient occluding only on second molars and all other teeth are out of occlusion. Articular eminence is moderately steep and not as steep as the opposite side. The condyle appears to be postured forward slightly in the fossa. There is some flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and it appears there is some anterior beaking present. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B425 has a relatively large adenoid mass in the nasopharynx area. Oropharyngeal area dimensions appear to be within normal limits. He has a possibly skeletal Class II occlusion but he has a significant anterior open bite of about 4 mm. There are double images of the occlusal plane and also of the inferior border of the mandible. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane clinically with the right side being 2 mm lower than the left side.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation (probable AICR.)
AP mandibular deficiency. AP maxillary deficiency.
Transverse maxillary deficiency.
Anterior open bite. Slight Class II end-on occlusal tendency.
Occluding only on left and right second molars with all other teeth out of occlusion.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 3 mm secondary to small upper lateral incisors.
Accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. Hypertrophied turbinates. Hypertrophied nasopharyngeal adenoid tissues. Hypertrophied tonsils. Nasal airway obstruction.

 
RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Align the arch in 2 levels with a step in the archwire to align the four incisors at an elevated plane compared to the posterior teeth. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Open up 1 mm of space around each upper lateral incisor to help compensate for the tooth size discrepancy.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it 4 mm, expand and level the curve of Spee.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in counterclockwise direction. Turbinectomies.
Adenoidectomy. Bilateral tonsillectomy. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B425 MRI Evaluation 
Age: 19/M

Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The condyle appears a little bit more fuzzy than the opposite side. It appears there may be some discal tissue anteriorly displaced. Joint space looks fairly reasonable in most of the views but I do not see discal tissue present. In one area it appears there is a little roughness on the head of the condyle but difficult to substantiate. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just relatively a minimal amount but actually fairly flat.

Right TMJ coronal view image is better than the opposite side. Condyle appears to have good mediolateral width. There may be a little flattening on the top of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just a minimal amount and a fairly sharp downward curvature but no more than a couple of mm. The medial aspect of the fossa wall appears unusual. It appears there may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Joint space actually looks fairly good except towards the medial side it appears decreased.

Left TMJ sagittal view that appears to have fairly good morphology. It has a hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting in front of the condyle. The disc is in a little bit better position. At the lateral aspect of the joint the discal tissue is very difficult to see. The joint space appears to be decreased posteriorly. There may be a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the articular disc with reduction of the disc probably relatively early on.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit more arthritic on this side. There is a greater amount of flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence is steeper on this side and almost goes perpendicular. The disc may be a little bit foreshortened. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc appears to reduce and there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the articular disc.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction.
