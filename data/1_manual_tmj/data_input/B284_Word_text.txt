B284 MRI Evaluation 
Age: 21/F
Date of Birth: 
Date of MRI: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. It appears to be a little bit flat on top. Decreased superior joint space. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears that there may be some discal tissue displaced medially as well as anteriorly.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. There is some discal tissue seen but with significant medial displacement. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears that there is discal tissue anterior to the condyle as well.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that towards the medial side is quite narrow anteroposteriorly. Out laterally it has a little bit better width. There is some flattening on the anterior head particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. There is slight posterosuperior projection of the condylar head. There is decreased joint space superiorly and particularly posteriorly. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting partially beneath the articular eminence and along the posterior slope of the eminence. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening there is relatively early reduction of the articular disc and good translation of the condyle and articular disc. Disc is in good condition.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with a little bit of anterior beaking but not too significant. There is decreased joint space superiorly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Discal tissue is not seen quite as readily at the lateral aspect of the joints as it is more medially. More medially it appears to be in a little bit better position. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is reduction of the articular disc and good translation of both the condyle and the articular disc. Some anterior beaking is a little bit more evident as well as some flattening on the superior head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears salvageable.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction. Right TMJ arthritis and medial displacement of the articular disc.
Both discs appear to salvageable and the patient appears to be a candidate for Mitek anchors to support repositioning of the articular discs.

B284 
B284 is 21 years old, referred by Dr. ___. B284   is in good health with no major medical problems. She takes birth control pills but no other medications. B284's problems began when she was about 17 to 18 years of age when she started to have headaches. She was put into orthodontic treatment to correct the problems but this generated some jaw pain factors for her. She had the orthodontics done 4 years ago. She then went into splint therapy from 3 years ago until now . The splints only help her for about two hours and then the pain returns so they have essentially been ineffective for her. She has had extensive physical therapy including treatment by three different physical therapists. She has had chiropractic treatment that has been ineffective and also acupuncture.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Jaw pain. "Migraine" headaches. Her pain currently starts in the jaw and progresses into the head. Headaches are predominately on the left side at about a level of 5 but it can escalate to 10. Headaches do also occur on the right side but usually only when the headaches on the left are quite severe. She rates her TMJ pain at 5 with it escalating to a level of 10. The pain is predominately on her left side. Her average daily pain is 5, jaw function is 3, diet is 2, disability at 2. She gets earaches on the left side. She has tinnitus, vertigo, but no hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching her teeth at night and also during the day. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the left TMJ, right styloid area and some minimal tenderness over the left medial pterygoid area. In joint function, the right side seems to function relatively smoothly. On the left side she can hear a rubbing type of sound but today there was no clicking, popping or evidence of crepitus.

CLINICAL EVALUATION:
Upper lip length is 18 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is 2 mm on the right and 1 mm on the left. The right side of the face is more full compared to the left side by probably 4 to 5 mm. In profile, she has good facial balance. Intraorally, she has a Class I cuspid relationship on the left side and a slight Class II end-on occlusal relationship on the right side by 2 to 3 mm. She has a transverse cant in the occlusion with the left side being 1 to 2 mm shorter vertically as compared to the right side. Mandibular dental midline shifted about ½ mm to the left and the chin is shifted about 2 to 3 mm to the left side. There is also a yaw in the maxillary mandibular arches with the jaw structures being rotated probably 2 perhaps as much as 3 mm off towards the right side which accounts for the increased fullness on the right side of the face. B284 has been aware of the asymmetry in the jaws. When she feels back at the angles she can feel more bone on the right side than she can on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of 2 mm. She has had her wisdom teeth removed.

B284 
Intraorally, the uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all appear relatively normal. Tonsils are moderate in size. Right turbinate may be mild to moderately enlarged. There is some deviation in the nasal septum but she has previous history of trauma and fracture of the nasal bones. There does not appear to be any significant nasal airway obstruction but there could be some mild.

When she was first diagnosed with the "migraines" headaches, she was placed on a lot of different medications such as amitriptyline, Depakote and numerous other medicines. B284 said she was put on 30 different medications over the years. She has not really taken anything in the last three years. Apparently she lost some hair and gained about 40 pounds on these medications and so she elected to stay off those. Maximal opening is 69 mm. Excursive movements to the right 9 mm, to the left 7 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. Difficult to evaluate the condyles but the left side looks a little bit more arthritic than the right side.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. Bony septum is relatively straight. The turbinates are moderate size with the right size being larger than the left side.

Left TMJ tomogram shows that there may be a little bit decreased joint space vertically posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle has reasonable form.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is more arthritic. It is smaller in anteroposterior dimension. It may have lost some vertical dimension. It is posteriorly and superiorly and superiorly positioned in the fossa with increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence has moderate steepness. On opening, both condyles have almost a hypertranslatory mobility.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows she has excellent oropharyngeal airway space. She appears to be relatively normal Class I skeletal and occlusal relationship.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Right TMJ condylar hyperplasia (probably arrested) with medial displaced articular disc.
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation.
TMJ pain. Headaches.
Class III end-on occlusion on the right side, Class I on the left.
Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 2 mm higher than the right side. Mandible shifted to the left approximately 3 mm at the chin area.
Posterior yaw of the jaws to the right side with about a 4 to 5 mm increased fullness in the right side of the face.
Asymmetry in the dental arches with the left cuspids being 2 mm posterior to the right cuspids. B284 

Premature contact on the maxillary left first bicuspid and mandibular first and second bicuspids. Earaches, tinnitus and vertigo. Daytime and nighttime clenching.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to level the arch and correct the significant asymmetry.
Maxillary osteotomies to level the maxilla and correct for facial asymmetry.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
