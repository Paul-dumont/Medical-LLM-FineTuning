B206 AGE: 54/F
I went over the other records forward to me. According to the questionnaire, she has no TMJ pain, headaches, myofascial pain, earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing at night. Other joints that bother her include her right knee, left hip, and some wrist and finger and joint pain. She gets headaches about once a month due to sinus congestion. Primary concerns are as follows:

Eating problems due to open bite in the front.
Unable to bite through foods.
The 4 or 5 teeth that do touch are getting worn and there are cracked fillings and onlays on the teeth. Mouth open when relaxed.
Crooked jaw and chin.

She has not no previous treatment. She has had previous knee surgery following a motor vehicle accident 24 years ago and then additional surgery 4 years ago. What she would like to accomplish is:

Get teeth straightened and jaws to meet together properly. Be able to chew foods with the front teeth. Be able to close the lips without effort.
Stop mouth breathing, particularly at night.
Stop the drooling that is due to her open mouth jaw position.
Straighten up the jaws and chin.

She does state that she breathes through her mouth always when she sleeps and also some during the day. Photos of her occlusion show that she has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right side, but Class I cuspid on the left side. She has an anterior open bite of probably about 4 to 5 mm. She has a posterior crossbite on the right side. She has an accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch and perhaps a slight reversed curve of Spee in the lower arch. She has some moderate crowding of the lower anterior arch. When smiling, she has a gummy smile.

Radiographic evaluation shows that she has all 4 third molars erupted in. I believe that she has all of her upper and lower teeth.
Axial view shows that the nasal septum is deviated off towards the right side. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Left TMJ sagittal view of the condyle shows a condyle that appears long in length. Joint space looks fairly good. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that is quite arthritic with loss of significant volume. There is decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears fairly wide and long vertically. There is decrease vertical joint space.
The right coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit smaller in width and vertical length, thus significant decrease in volume compared to the opposite site. There is decreased vertical joint space.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has:
Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
AP mandibular deficiency. Accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch.
Perhaps a slightly reversed curve of Spee in the lower arch.
A high occlusal plane angle of 15 degrees.
Vertical imbalance at the inferior border of the mandible with the right side perhaps 6-7 mm shorter vertically than the left side. Oropharyngeal airway dimension of about 5 mm at the base of the tongue.

Recommended treatment would include:
MRI of TMJs.
Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level the maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots forward and cuspid roots distally. Align the 4 incisors at an elevated plane by placing a step upward between the cuspids and lateral incisors.
Align and level the mandibular arch.
Surgery.
TMJ surgery depending on the MRI results.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to align and level the occlusal planes.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance in a counter-clockwise rotation. Intranasal procedures to open the airway (turbinectomies, septoplasty).
Other procedures as indicated following clinical examination.

This treatment plan should get her a nice treatment outcome. It would be very helpful if I could see her clinically to complete a thorough evaluation and finalize the treatment plan.

B206 is 54 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B206 is in good health. She has had hepatitis C in the past. Her primary concerns are:
Eating difficulties due to anterior open bite with inability to bite through foods. Four to five teeth, predominantly molars, touch and are getting worn with cracked fillings and inlays.
Mouth breathing.
Difficulties breathing through the nose. Crooked jaw and chin.

She has had two previous right knee surgeries, one following an automobile accident 24 years ago and the same knee was operated on 4 years ago to remove a bursa from the right knee.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B206 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3.5 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about 2 to 3 mm off to the right side. Chin is probably about 4 to 5 mm off to the right side. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are fairly close to being aligned. In profile, the upper lip and maxilla are probably about 3 to 3 mm AP deficient and the chin is probably about 10 to 12 mm AP deficient. The chin neckline is shorter, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. She does have a slight head postured forward head position. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the third molars present. She has some significant crowding of the lower anterior arch and malrotations of the teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the third molars. She has significantly constricted maxillary arch transversely. She has some moderate crowing in the upper arch as well. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right side and closer to Class I on the left side. B206 has an anterior open bite of about 4 mm. She has right-sided crossbite. She has a significantly increased curve of Wilson in the lower arch and also in the upper arch. The lower posterior teeth are tipped lingually and the upper teeth are tipped buccally. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and relatively normal in architecture. Intranasally, the septum is deviated a little bit off towards the right side. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. Luminal valves may be slightly constricted. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the masseter muscles and retromandibular area. On opening, initially she had no noises in her joints. On excursion, she had some consistent clicking in the left joint. Then on closing as she would open the first time, the left joint would click. Maximum incisal opening is 56 mm. Excursion movements are about 8 mm in each direction. There is a slight transverse cant in the occlusion with the maxillary left side being no more than a millimeter lower than the right side and in the mandibular arch on the left side is 1 to 2 mm lower than the right side. She does demonstrate some bilateral infraorbital hypoplasia.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows a large condyle on the left side and a small condyle with significant arthritic changes on the right side. Sinuses appear relatively clear. All the teeth are present through the third molars. Septum appears deviated a little bit off towards the right side and turbinates are moderately large with the left one being significantly larger than the right side. Coronal view shows a significant deviation of the septum off towards the right side. The turbinate on that side is not quite as a large, but with the septum deviated, it decreases the airway there. The left turbinate is quite large. Sinus, however, appear clear. Septum appears off towards the right side. Axial view shows that the turbinates are enlarged, with the left side being larger than the right side. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is enlarged vertically as well as mediolaterally. There appears to be a little bit of anterior beaking present. Joint space in some areas appears decreased. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is small in size. There is some anterior beaking present. Joint space appears reasonable. Coronal view of the left condyle shows that there appears to be significantly decreased joint space vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 2 mm. There appears to be greater decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the fossa as compared to the middle and medial side. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is narrow in mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased joint space. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there appears to be AP maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia. There is anterior vertical excess. There is an anterior open bite of approximately 3 to 4 mm. There appears to be a high occlusal plane angle. The AP dimension of oropharyngeal airway measures about 5 mm at the base of the tongue and about 5 mm at the soft palate level as well. B206 has a tooth size discrepancy of about 2 mm. There is a reversed curve of Spee in the lower arch with the incisors being probably 3 mm lower than the flat plane. In the upper arch, she has a definite rocker shaped curve of Spee with the incisors being almost 4 mm above the flat plane. B206 occludes predominantly on the first and second molars on the left side and first, second, and third molars on the right side.

Basic diagnoses for B206 would be as follows:
Left TMJ condylar hyperplasia (arrested) and articular disc dislocated anteriorly at the lateral aspect of the joint and posteriorly at the medial aspect. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated without reduction. Maxillary AP hypoplasia, vertical hyperplasia, and transverse hypoplasia.
AP mandibular hypoplasia and asymmetry with mandible shifted off to the right side approximately 3 mm. Anterior open bite of 3 to 4 mm. Class II end-on occlusion on the right side, Class I occlusion on the left side. Right-sided crossbite.
Significant crowding in the lower anterior arch and moderate crowding in the maxillary anterior arch. Reverse curve of Spee in the lower arch and accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. Increased curve of Wilson in both arches. Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 5 mm (normal 11 mm).
Septal deviation off towards the right side. Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction.
Malaligned third molars x4. Occludes predominantly on the first and second molars with the other teeth essentially out of occlusion. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 1 to 2 mm lower than the right side.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align the maxillary arch in two occlusal planes by placing a vertical step to align the four incisors at an elevated plane and to try to extrude the cuspids vertically 1 to 2 mm, if possible. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth size discrepancy and to try to keep from flaring the lower incisors too far forward. Upright molars over basal bone to decrease the curve of Wilson. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Right TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Left mandibular sagittal split osteotomy to advance the mandible. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly, expand it, and eliminate the accentuated curve of Spee. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty. Fat graft to right TMJ (harvest from the abdomen).
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B206 MRI AGE: 54/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is a very shallow lateral rim of the fossa. There is decreased vertical joint space. Discal tissue may be anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is small in size and appears to have undergone significant condylar resorption. There is a little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. Joint space is decreased vertically. There may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The left condylar head and neck appears long in length. The articular disc appears to be posteriorly displaced towards the medial aspect of the joint, but at the lateral aspect of the joint it appears to be anteriorly displaced. The impression is that there is a rotational displacement of the disc. On opening, the disc appears to reduce.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears much shorter in vertical height compared to the opposite side. There may be a little bit of sclerosis of the head of the condyle. Some slight anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly degenerated. There may be some slight fluid in the superior joint space. On opening in some of the views, it appears that there is moderately good translation, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction, but in one view in mid opening, it shows that the disc is reduced slightly.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ elongated condylar head and neck with rotational displacement of the articular disc with it being posteriorly displaced medially and anteriorly displaced laterally. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated without reduction.
