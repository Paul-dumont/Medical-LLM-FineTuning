B456 
B456 is 43 years old and referred by Dr. XX.
Patient History
She has had a previous hysterectomy. Other minor surgeries she has had include breast biopsy and a C-section. She is aware of having other areas of osteoarthritis that include her neck and her lower back.

The onset of B456's problems began a little over three years ago when she was involved in a motor vehicle accident and sustained a whiplash injury. Since that time, she has developed severe pain problems and headaches. She wore a splint for a year. She has been on numerous medications. She has had physical therapy, acupuncture, manipulations, water therapy, hands on treatment, etc. When she gets her severe headaches, they can lead to nausea and vomiting, difficulties walking, and difficulties with vision. She has earaches predominantly on the right side and tinnitus. She gets occasional vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her neck, back, shoulders, fingers, hips, knees, and feet. She has some environmental allergies. She cannot wear cheap earrings. She is not aware of any nocturnal clenching and bruxism habits.

B456 rates her headaches that occur predominantly in the right temporal area but can migrate to the frontal and posterior head area at a level of 8. She gets these two to three times per week, but these headaches can easily escalate to a 10. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, overall pain at 4, jaw function at 5, diet at 4, and disability at 4.

Current Medications
Estradiol Maxalt 10 mg for migraine
Clinical Examination
B456 has good facial symmetry and balance. In profile view, she has good facial balance. Chin-neckline is fairly well defined, and chin-neck angle is well defined.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding, lower anterior arch. She has an accentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch. In the upper arch, she is missing the right second and third molar and the left third molar. She essentially has a Class II cuspid-molar relationship. She has an overjet of probably about 4 mm and anterior deep-bite of probably about 3 to 4 mm. Oropharynx appears relatively clear.

Intranasally, turbinates don't appear too large but relatively normal in size. She has a significant nasal spur off the right side that does block the airway a little bit. On the left side, she has a narrow nostril secondary to a significant left lateral deviation of the nasal septum at the anterior aspect of the septum. Holding the left nostril open enabled B456 to breathe much easier through her nose. To palpation, she has mild to moderate discomfort over the temporalis, masseters, medial pterygoid, TMJ, styloid area, and SCM. No tenderness at all on the left side. In function, she has audible crepitation in the right TMJ. Left joint seems to function relatively smoothly. She is not aware of any significant clicking or popping in the left TMJ area. Maximal incisal opening is 35 mm but without significant pain only 23 mm. Excursive movement to the left is 5 mm and to the right 0. It is probably due to the fact she feels something is going to break on the right side if she shifts over to that side. B456's overjet in central relation is about 6 to 7 mm. She can protrude straight forward about 8 mm.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and maxillary right second molar. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Left turbinate appears a little bit enlarged compared to the right turbinate. Airway, however, for the most part looks reasonably good in the bony areas. Has a root canal in the maxillary right central incisor. Demonstrates some significant osteoarthritic changes in the right condyle. Left condyle looks a little bit more normal.

Right TMJ Waters view shows that there is some significant deviation of the nasal septum. Turbinates appear just moderate in size. Sinuses appear clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with a condyle with a little bit of hockey stick shape to it. A little sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Joint space appears a little bit decreased vertically. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Disc could be displaced or at least is extremely thin.

Right TMJ tomogram shows the condyle postured way forward, and I believe she probably wasn't in centric relation when this x-ray was taken. Posterior superior joint space is excessively increased and measures about 6 to 7 mm. We will retake this film in centric relation.

Opening views show that she has some restricted translation bilaterally, although the condyles do come forward onto the articular eminence, and both condyles seem to translate reasonably well. Decreased joint space on the left side between the condylar head and articular eminence. Right condyle looks significantly more arthritic than the left condyle.

Cephalometrically, she also is not in centric relation and actually has her mandible postured forward significantly to an end-on relationship.
Right TMJ tomogram, new one taken in centric relation, shows severely decreased vertical joint space with significant anterior beaking. Decreased anterior joint space as well indicative of total displacement of the articular disc and most likely a large perforation through the remaining tissues.

Cephalometrically, B456 has a Class II dental and skeletal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway appears reasonably good.
Basic Diagnoses
Right TMJ severe arthritis with articular disc dislocation and severe degenerative changes
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
AP mandibular hypoplasia
Class II occlusion
Anterior deep-bite
Severe headaches TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Earaches Tinnitus

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics
Align and level maxillary arch. Strip lower anterior teeth and retract. Consider stripping bicuspids as well to prevent excessive flaring of the lower anteriors

Surgery
Option 1
Bilateral TMJ condylectomies, debridement, reconstruction, and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvested from abdomen)
Possible bilateral coronoidectomies if they will potentially cause any functional interferences

Option 2
Right TMJ total joint prostheses
Fat graft to right TMJ (harvested from abdomen)
Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor
Left mandibular sagittal split osteotomy to advance the mandible

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B456  MRI Evaluation 
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Appears to be an osteophyte sticking down from the fossa area toward the medial side of the condyle. Appears to be some compressed tissue in the joint space, but the disc appears to be more anteriorly positioned. Except for where the osteophyte is, the joint space seems to be pretty well balanced.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Decreased joint space vertically, however. Lateral rim of the fossa has a very minimal downward curvature. Discal tissues appear to perhaps be anteriorly positioned.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some flattening of the anterior head and some anterior beaking present. Some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence.

On opening, the condyle appears to reduce onto the disc, and there is fairly good translation of both the condyle and the disc. On the sagittal views, the osteophyte seen in the coronal views is not observed.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows anterior beaking of the condyle and significantly decreased joint space particularly vertically. Disc is anteriorly displaced. Significantly decreased anterior joint space actually. Anterior beaking is quite marked. Condyle appears somewhat enlarged.

On opening, the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction
Right TMJ with advanced arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and severely deformed
