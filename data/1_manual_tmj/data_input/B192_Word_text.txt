B192
B192 is 25 years old. B192 feels that her TMJ problems began at about the age of 22 when she began developing pain and headaches. The only treatment she has had has basically been splint therapy for about 2 to 2-1/2 years. The last adjustments were done by Dr. XXXX at Shands associated with the University of Florida. She is aware that her bite is changing. She has had no previous orthodontics. Etiology is unknown, although it has been suspected she could have Sjogren's or rheumatoid arthritis, although neither has yet been proven. She gets headaches at about a level of 8 that occur 3 to 5 times per week predominantly in the temple areas with the left side being worse than the right side. She rates her TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at 7, jaw function at 7, diet at 6, disability at 4. She gets occasional earaches, but no tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. The only other joints that bother her are her knees, but she is a runner also. She is aware of clenching and bruxing during the day and maybe at night, but she is able to control her daytime clenching better that she is aware of it. She takes the following medications:

Naproxen 2 times per day for 2 months. She will take an occasional Excedrin but not very often.
An occasional ibuprofen. She also takes Yaz.
Lab tests that were done 8 months ago show that she does have an elevated rheumatoid factor, but her CCP was less than 16. HLA B27 is present. C-reactive protein is within normal range.

In frontal view, B192 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 29 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 1 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is about 2 mm off to the right side. The mandibular dental midline is about 1.5 mm to the left. The mandibular dental midline and chin are well aligned. In profile, upper lip supralabrale is almost posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is deficient probably by at least 3 to 4 mm. The chin is retruded by about 15 to 18 mm. The chin neckline is extremely short, although the angle is moderately well defined. She has a lip incompetence of about 6 mm. She has some protrusion of the lower lip. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch and has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some crowding of the anterior teeth and there is a slight division 2 relationship. The lateral incisors look small in size. In centric relation, she occludes initially on the right second molars and all other teeth are out of occlusion. With closing a little bit more, she may then bite on the first molars and perhaps touching on the left side as well, but the rest of the teeth are out of occlusion. She has a Class II end-on occlusive relationship being approximately 5 mm Class II. She has a zero vertical overbite relationship. She has an overjet of about 2 to 3 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal. B192 is not aware of any snoring problems, but has some mild daytime somnolence but is not aware of any sleep apnea. She tosses and turns a lot at night. She breathes predominantly through her mouth at nighttime and also during the day. She tries not to put her teeth together because it is uncomfortable for her. Intranasally, the left turbinate appears mild to moderately enlarged but the right one looks relatively normal. The septum is deviated off towards the right side anteriorly. To palpation she has moderate pain through most of the head and neck area with a little bit milder in the temporalis and posterior neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 43 mm, but only about 28 mm without pain or discomfort. Excursion movements are about 5 mm in each direction. She has a head postured forward neck position.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. All the rest of the teeth are present. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Condyles appear arthritic. The right styloid process appears somewhat elongated.

Coronal view shows that the septum is deviated slightly off to the left side with a small spur. The left turbinate IS enlarged and appears to be obstructing the airway. The right turbinate is relatively normal in size. The sinuses appear relatively clear.

Axial view shows that the left turbinate is enlarged and the right one is relatively normal. The sinuses appear clear.
Left TMJ coronal views show that there is loss of condylar volume vertically and mediolaterally. There is decreased vertical joint space. The condyles appear arthritic. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal tomograms show arthritic condyle with loss of vertical volume as well as mediolateral width. There is significantly decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm on this side. There are significant degenerative changes in both condyles.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite arthritic with loss of vertical volume. There is anterior beaking and sclerosis in the head of the condyle. There is a little osteophyte that appears to stick up off of the condyle more towards the lateral aspect. The articular eminence has a relatively soft inclination. Joint space appears decreased. There appear to some small pseudocysts in the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that appears to have lost significant vertical volume. There is anterior beaking present. There is significantly decreased vertical joint space and also the posterior joint space is decreased towards the lateral aspect of the joint. The articular eminence has a relatively soft inclination. There appear to some small pseudocysts in the head of the condyle.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the maxilla and mandible are retruded. She has a division 2 incisor relationship. Oropharyngeal airway is significantly reduced with an AP dimension of about 4 mm at the soft palate level, although at the base of the tongue it is closer to about 7.5 mm. She does have an open bite tendency. On the Lateral cephalogram, the head is tipped up slightly so the airway could even be more slightly more deficient. B192 does have a slight transverse occlusal plane asymmetry with the left side being about 1 to 1.5 mm higher than the right side. There is a significant tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 4.8 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B192 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis (possibly due to adolescent internal condylar resorption versus rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue autoimmune disease process. Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 4 mm (normal AP dimension 11 mm).
Class II occlusion.
Anterior open bite.
Occluding only on the first and second molars with all other teeth out of occlusion. Left nasal turbinate hyperplasia with nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain. Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Significant tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 4.8 mm.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Open up 0.5 mm of space between each of the maxillary incisors using coil springs creating a total of approximately 3 mm of spacing. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid root distally to make room for interdental osteotomies in case they are necessary. b.	Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and close the spaces.
2. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints.
3. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise redirection. c.	Bilateral fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.	Bilateral coronoidotomies. e.	Left nasal partial turbinectomy.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5. Restorative dentistry to place bonding, veneers, or crowns on the maxillary anterior teeth to eliminate the spacing.

B192 MRI
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic with some peaking of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint. There is sclerosis within the condylar head and anterior beaking. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The joint space is decreased a little bit vertically. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears more degenerated with large areas of sclerosis within the head of the condyle. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed and degenerated. There appears to be fluid in the superior joint space. The superior joint space is decreased as well as the posterior joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There is fluid in the superior joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost vertical and mediolateral width. The disc is anteriorly and medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. The joint space is slightly decreased. Upon opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle, but the articular discs remain anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost significant volume vertically and mediolaterally. There is significantly greater loss of vertical joint space compared to the opposite side. There appears to be some fluid in the joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. Upon opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle, but the articular discs remain anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ advanced arthritis with articular discs anteriorly displaced, deformed and degenerated and non-reducing.
