B282 
B282 is 43 years old, referred by Dr. ___. B282's problems began about 15 years ago when she was involved in a motor vehicle accident. She went through the windshield and apparently did some damage to her jaw joints. 15 years ago, Dr. ___ performed maxillary mandibular osteotomies on her and her pain and headaches actually went away for a while. For the past two to three years she began developing some significant pain problems once again. Last year, Dr. ___ performed a bilateral arthrocentesis. This gave her relief for a very short time and then the pain came back with significant pain problems again.

PRIMARY CONCERNS: TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Bite is off and appears to be continuing to shift and get worse with the lower jaw moving towards the right side.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Significant noises in the joints.

She has problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo and she has hearing loss. The only medications that B282 currently takes include Synthroid and Wellbutrin.

She has problems with her hips but no other joints. She has difficulties with wearing gold on her fingers but she can still wear gold earrings. She has had physical therapy during this past year including electrical stimulation without improvement. She has had bite splints but this seems to increase her pain levels. She does have numbness in the lower lip and chin area.

In frontal view, B282 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third face and there may be some slight asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1.5 mm in midline about 2 mm lateral. Maxillary midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the right and the chin is probably about 3 mm off to the right. In profile view B282 has probably about at least 4 or perhaps 5 or 6 mm of AP maxillary deficiency. Upper lip supralabrale is about at 3 mm posterior to subnasale. Chin is at least 20 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline is extremely short. Chin-neck angle is positioned just posterior to the horizontal aspect of the chin in the menton region. Intraorally, B282 is missing maxillary mandibular first bicuspids. She had some moderate crowding in the lower anterior arch. She is fairly close to being Class I cuspid molar on the left side maybe just a slight Class II on the right side. She is missing her wisdom teeth. In the frontal view the right pupil is probably 1 to 2 mm higher than the left side. Transverse occlusal plane is fairly level. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. The uvula is a little bit enlarged but not too significant. Soft palate appears to be a little bit posteriorly positioned. Faucial pillars appear relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum appears reasonably straight. Turbinates are short in vertical dimension because of probable previous turbinectomies. I do not believe there is any nasal airway obstruction. B282 appears to have a 2.5 mm vertical overbite relationship. To palpation, she has fairly severe pain to palpation over the TMJs, styloid areas, masseters and moderate pain over the temporalis muscles. B282  Page 2

She has crepitus and noises in both TMJs on opening but also on the left side she has a crepitation and a popping kind of noise that probably occurs at about 35 mm of opening. Incisal opening is about 47 mm and excursive movements are 9 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four first bicuspids and all four third molars. There were plates in the mandibular sagittal split area and also a plate in the chin area. There are interosseous wires in the chin area as well. In the maxilla there are four bone plates with two screws in each plate. There are interosseous wires also present there. The right condyle appears arthritic. The left condyle appears arthritic and quite small in size compared to the right one. She has a root canal in mandibular right cuspid. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Waters views shows that the bony septum appears reasonably straight. The sinuses appear relatively clear. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be in posterior position in the fossa with what appears to be significantly decreased joint space. The condyle looks arthritic and appears small in size.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic and is positioned anteriorly and posteriorly in the fossa. Some anterior beaking is present. Articular eminences of both joints are relatively normal. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a high occlusal plane angle and has retruded maxilla and mandible. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 2 mm in some areas at the base of the tongue about 3 to 4 mm at the soft palate level.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis.
AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
High occlusal plane angle.
Severe decreased oropharyngeal airway of 2 mm (normal 11 mm.)
Snoring.
Sleep apnea symptoms.
Daytime somnolence.
Missing all four first bicuspids and all four third molars.
Severe TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing probably about 2 mm of tooth structure so as to keep from flaring them any further forward.
CT scan of TMJs and jaws (TMJ Concepts protocol.)
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement using TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. Bilateral coronoidectomies. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen.)
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B282 MRI Evaluation
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. It appears to have lost some volume perhaps. Decreased joint space vertically. There appears to be a little osteophyte sticking out from the lateral aspect of the lateral rim. There may be a small osteophyte kind of protuberance from the lateral pole of the condyle. The joint space is decreased. There appears to be discal tissue anteromedially.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite small in size and appears to have lost vertical and anteroposterior dimensions. Significant anterior beaking is present. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence and appears significantly distorted and degenerated. On opening it appears that the disc does not reduce and remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit larger than the opposite side. There is a decreased superior joint space particularly towards the lateral rim of the fossa. There appears to be discal tissue anteriorly dislocated.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is small in size. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly dislocated. On opening the disc appears to remain anteriorly displaced without reduction. On opening there is fairly good translation but there appears to be virtually no joint space and the disc does appear to remain anteriorly dislocated.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs dislocations without reduction and the discs are severely degenerated. Consideration for a total joint prosthesis.
