B273 
B273 is 28 years old, referred by Dr. ___ and Dr. ___. B273 has had problems with endometriosis in the past. B273 has had two surgeries for her endometriosis. She had surgery in 2 years ago and last year. Otherwise, she is in fairly good health except for the jaw problems.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Hydrocodone 7.5/500 mg tablets.
Flexeril 10 mg tablets 2 tablets per day.
Celebrex 200 mg at night.
Zyrtec.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Jaw hurts badly.
Jaw pain is continual and significantly impacts her daily life.
Her main vocation is being a vocalist singing jazz in Kansas City and her problems are threatening to her career and happiness.

B273's problems began when she was about 12 when she would have occasional popping in her joints. Her orthodontist told her at that time that she may have problems. She had orthodontics from the age of 12 to 14 for about 18 months. B273 did have two maxillary teeth extracted and the upper teeth retracted back to meet her lower jaw. She continued to have clicking and popping since that time. For the past 6 months her situation has gotten much worse and about 4 months ago her pain has become continuous. Etiology is unknown. She gets headaches at a level of 6 in the temporal and posterior head areas. She rates her TMJ pain at 9 average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 8, diet at 7 and disability at 8. She gets severe earaches and gets some tinnitus and vertigo. No other joints bother her. She believes that she may clench or brux sometimes at night because sometimes she will wake up with her headaches and pain and other times it gets worse during the day. She does have probably some moderate snoring. She has some mild to moderate daytime somnolence. She is not specifically aware of having sleep apnea symptoms. She does have mild to moderate sleep disorder.

In frontal view, B273 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third face. A little bit of asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 to 3.5 mm. Maxillary dental midline is off to the left side of at least 1 mm to 1.5 mm as is the mandibular dental midline. Chin is off to the left probably about 6 to 7 mm. Mandibular dental midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline and maybe just a little bit to the right 1 mm. B273 has lip incompetence of approximately 8 mm. B273 has a head postured forward neck position. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale. Upper lip is retruded by about 4 to 5 mm. Chin is retruded probably about 18 mm. Chin-neckline is short although the chin-neck angle is reasonably well defined. Intraorally, B273 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. There is some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch she is missing first bicuspids. She has a good Class I cuspid molar relationship. Vertical overbite is 4 mm. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane is about 2 mm being vertical short on the left side. B273 Page 2

Uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal. Faucial pillars may be mildly constricted. Tonsils appear relatively normal. B273 does state that since this problem began about 6 months ago that when she sings she gets a swelling in her throat area and she pointed back towards the right tonsil. Apparently it enlarges. Intranasally, turbinates appear maybe a little bit enlarged but not too significant. Septum appears relatively normal. Nasal airway may have some mild or moderate destruction but not too significant. Maximal incisal opening voluntarily by B273 was 23 mm but only 13 mm without significant pain. Excursive movements are about 5 mm in each direction but painful. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly for the small amount of opening she can achieve. She says that on a rare occasion she can open wider and she hears like a tearing noise in her joints. She does get some strange sensations and sounds in her right ear at times where she feels like there is a fluid rushing around the area.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars and maxillary first bicuspids. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Left condyle appears severely arthritic. Right side appears to have some arthritis but not as severe as the left side. The left side has lost vertical volume and dimension. She has root canals in the mandibular right first and second molars.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. The septum appears relatively straight. Turbinates appear moderate in size. It appears that she has adequate airway.

Right TMJ tomogram is a little difficult to read but it appears that there is decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. On opening, there is severe restriction of translation.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is severely arthritic and has lost volume. There is decreased posterior joint space. There may be an osteophyte extending posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening, there is significant restriction of translatory movements.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a retruded maxilla and a significantly retruded mandible. She has a high occlusal plane angle. There is a definite difference in the vertical position of the inferior border of the mandible with the left side being about 7 mm shorter vertically than the right side. She has a decreased oropharyngeal airway of only about 4 mm at the soft palate level but at the base of the tongue it is closer to about 8 or 9 mm. She does have a neck postured forward head position.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Left TMJ severe arthritis with condylar resorption, displaced articular disc severely degenerated and non-salvageable.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.
AP mandibular hypoplasia and asymmetry with the chin shifted to the left side. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia as well as asymmetry.
Missing maxillary first bicuspids.

B273  MRI EVALUATION
DOB: 
Date of Acquisition:
Date of Interpretation: 
Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly by probably about 3 mm. Cannot specifically identify discal tissue. There may be some slight decreased joint space out laterally but otherwise the joint space looks fairly good.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have severe osteoarthritic changes with loss of condylar height. A little bit of beaking laterally and medially. There may be some decreased joint space out laterally. Difficult to identify discal tissue. There appears to be some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Discal tissue is difficult to identify.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears small in size. There are some arthritic changes. Flattening on the anterior head and anterior beaking. There may be a little osteophyte sticking up in the posterior aspect of the head. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Joint space maybe slightly increased vertically. The disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost anterior to the articular eminence. There is a short and anteroposterior dimension deformed and degenerated. Images are somewhat hard to see. MRI report shows that she has erosive changes in the left TMJ with reduced translation. The disc is not well seen.

On the right side the disc is seen and appears to be anteriorly displaced without reduction in the open views.
IMPRESSION: Left TMJ severe arthritis with a non-salvageable disc.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.

B273 
B273 presents today for follow-up evaluation. She is accompanied by Mr. __. They are here to talk about funding for her and for providing research funding for some of our research projects. I reviewed in detail her diagnosis and recommended treatment. I also reviewed with her and Mr. __ the potential risks and complications including nerve damage and facial paralysis. I answered all the questions that she and Mr. __ had today. She is ready for surgery when she is ready to proceed on.

B273 
The patient presents this morning for implantation of samples of chromium cobalt alloy and titanium alloy. Under local anesthesia, a stab incision was made in two places in the forearm. In the upper incision the chromium cobalt implant was placed and in the lower incision a titanium alloy implant. One suture was used to close each of the incisions and a Steri-Strip placed over top. The placement was done under sterile conditions with iodoform prep before the surgery was performed. She tolerated the procedure well. She is to have her sutures removed back home next week and is to keep me informed of any changes that she sees in reference to a reaction. She has had a previous history of cellulitis but I told her how to differentiate between that and an actual reaction to the materials.

B273 
Telephone conversation with __: She had a lot of questions she wanted to ask about B273's surgery. Apparently she has friend who is an orthopedic surgeon or some type of a physician who came up with a lot of questions that she thought that __should ask. She asked all the questions, everything from muscle attachments, muscle function, diet, pain autogenous tissues, fat grafts etc. I answered those questions to the best of my abilities and I believe they satisfied her. She felt that all arthritis was caused by connective tissue autoimmune disease obviously and I informed her otherwise. She will call me again if she has any other questions. B273 

Telephone conversation with Dr. __: B273 came in to see him yesterday for a first appointment. She is tentatively scheduled for surgery. She has a fairly good occlusal relationship so basically we need braces put on her teeth and passive archwires. He understands and will to get this accomplished as well he will put "K-hooks" on her teeth.

B273 
The patient presents for final surgical workup. Final records were taken. H&P performed. Consent form reviewed and signed. I did my final examination. I answered all the questions she, her mother and her boyfriend had. She is ready for surgery tomorrow. She did state that she is tongue tied and does not have very good mobility of her tongue. I told her that we could do a glossoplasty procedure including multiple Z-plasties to improve her tongue mobility. It will make her tongue swell quite a bit but in the long run it should give her better mobility. She will think about it and let me know tomorrow if she wants to have that procedure done as well.

B273 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Occlusion is good. Moderate edema is present. Suture lines are intact. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. Removed her sutures today. Lightened up her elastics anteriorly. She has no particular complaints at this time except for her pain being worse on the left side than the left side.

B273 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well and feeling much better today as compared to yesterday. I took off all her elastics. Occlusion is good and she can go into good occlusion. Airway is good. She said that since I removed two of the elastics yesterday that her pain level has significantly decreased. Perhaps taking all the elastics off may help her a little bit more. She knows she can put the anterior elastics back on if she needs them for anterior vertical support. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She is in great spirits and able to smile with a little bit of decreased function of the left marginal mandibular nerve. She otherwise is progressing very nicely and is to return to see me in 2 days. I answered all the questions she and her friend and mother had today.

B273 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. She had two crowns come loose in the lower right quadrant. These apparently must have come off during surgery because they are now cemented down in place and she has a posterior open bite of about 1 to 2 mm. However, the crowns are lower than the bicuspid on that side so they will eventually need to be replaced and should be able to get the occlusion fit together nicely. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She is in great spirits and getting her diet down well although she said she is continuing to lose some weight and she just needs to increase her dietary intake. I answered all the questions she and her mother had today. She is doing well and she is to return to see me in one week.

B273 
Telephone conversation with Dr. __ : The patient is doing very well. He will probably see her in about two weeks. At that time he can do whatever mechanics necessary to finish up her bite. She is progressing very nicely. She is to call me if she has any concerns or problems after she sees him again. I told him to be aggressive with the orthodontics.

B273 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Occlusion is stable. Open bite in the right molars. These are the teeth that were probably pulled during surgery and then were back in at a lower level. She will eventually needs those crowns built up. She otherwise is progressing well. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She has some extremely sore areas in her abdomen. This is actually where the fat grafts were harvested. She is very tender and sore around the jaws and the face. Incision lines look good. She seems to be progressing well. Today, as I was working with her I popped off the crown on the mandibular right first molar. Dr. __  resubmitted it into position. She is to return to see me in one day.

B273 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Occlusion is remaining stable. She popped off mandibular right first molar crown again. We will try to use a more permanent cement to see if we can get it to stay better. Otherwise, occlusion is remaining stable and she seems to be progressing well. Moderate edema as expected. I answered all the questions she had today. She needed some prescriptions and I have given her the following prescriptions:
Ultram 50 mg dispensing, 50 tablets one tablet q.3-4h. p.r.n. pain.
Bethanechol 50 mg tablets, dispensing 60, one tablet q.6h. Zyrtec 5 mg tablets, dispensing 10 tablets, one tablet b.i.d.

She is to keep me informed of her progress. She is to return to see me in one week. B273 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing very well. Occlusion is good. I placed a vertical elastic on the right side in the lower first and second bicuspid, upper first bicuspid. Incisal opening is 41 mm. Excursive movements are about 3 mm in each direction and she pushes herself. I gave her instructions on jaw exercises. She is progressing well and is to return to see me in about 2 to 3 weeks.

B273 
The patient presents for follow-up evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. No particular complaints or problems. Occlusion is good. Her shift is open on the right side. I am going to suggest to Dr. __ that he place some buttons on the linguals of the posterior teeth so that he could use vertical elastics lingually and labially. Incisal opening is 30 mm. Excursive movements are about 3 mm in each direction. She is in good spirits and is progressing well. She is to return to see me in about 3 to 4 weeks.

B273 
Telephone conversation with Dr. __ : I discussed with him B273's progress. We did discuss perhaps putting some buttons on lingually to see if we could use elastics lingually and labially and decrease the amount of posterior vertical open bite that she has present currently. He will evaluate that situation. He would like to improve her overall alignment but I told him that she might not want to pursue that because she feels that it is interfering with the progressing of professional degree. He is to keep me informed of her progress.

B273 
The patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Incisal opening is 38 mm. Excursion movements are almost 2 mm in each direction. She is very happy with the results. She says she can sing much better now than she could before the surgery. Edema for the most part is gone. Still has some pain and discomfort as expected for which she is basically taking Advil. I gave her a prescription for Celebrex 200-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.d., refill #5. She is to keep me informed of her progress and to return to see me in 2 months for a 6-month followup. She is to keep me informed of her progress and call me if she has any questions or concerns.

B273 
B273 presents for followup evaluation. She is doing reasonably well. Incisal opening is 40 mm. Excursion movements are about 3 mm in each direction. She has no direct TMJ pain unless you palpate it. Average daily pain is at 6, jaw function at 2, diet at 3, disability at 4. The biggest problem she has is clenching at night. She says that her boyfriend Michael said she clenches and grinds severely and that the noise she generates is significant. She stopped taking the Klonopin some time ago. She is taking Ambien now to help her sleep because she has insomnia, but this is not helping with her clenching and bruxism. Her appliances have been removed and she is in occlusal coverage splints. She has significant pain to palpation over the masseter muscles, posterior neck muscles, TMJ areas, and to a lesser degree in the temporalis and SCM's. I suggested she start taking the Klonopin again instead of the Ambien. She is to keep me informed of her progress. She has contacted her dentist to restore her crowns and occlusion on the right side. She is working a lot now singing and this is aggravating her situation. Hopefully, being on the Klonopin will help improve her situation.

B273 
Telephone conversation with her. She continues to have some pain. She is about 10 ½ months post surgery now. She continues to have pain on that left side particularly. She is having some pain in the maxillary left first molar that has had a previous root canal. Apparently, there may be some pathology at the tip of the teeth. The dentist took an x-ray and, of course, angled it on that side through the bone plate over the roots of those teeth, but on Panorex the bone plate is well above the roots of the first molar. She said that they tested the tooth with percussion, and it was sore, but did not respond hot or cold as expected. Her teeth and gums are probably still numb from the surgical procedures. She may need to have that root canal re-treated. The dentist is going to look closely to see if there is a missed root that did not get treated with root canal therapy. She was put on some antibiotics and she says that it feels better. She will try to come down to see me within the next month.

B273 
Telephone conversation with B273 . I have tried to call her on several occasions, and I have been unable to get a hold of her, although I have left messages. I was able to get a hold of her today finally. They were happy to hear from me because last night they were at a club and an altercation occurred nearby and she got hit in the left temple side of the face. She says her bite is remaining stable, and her boyfriend confirmed that her bite does not appear to have changed.

About 1-1/2 months ago, she fell down some stairs and she felt and heard a pop in her head. She does not recall striking her jaw, but does recall the pop. Since then, her pain has been somewhat worse with the left side greater than the right side. In addition, she feels a bubble in the left jaw area about level with the earlobe and forward about half an inch to an inch. It has developed over time, but she does not feel that it is getting any larger. It is somewhat tender to palpation. It could be a cyst, lymph node, or other factor. She believes that she is clenching at night and she has fitful sleep.

She takes the following medications:
Celebrex 200 mg q.d. One-half of a 0.5 mg Klonopin p.r.n., but not every night. Advil.
Hydrocodone, but this makes it very difficult for her to drive.
Ambien, which tends to help her sleep.

I suggested that at this time we try some alternative medications. I suggested she take magnesium 250-mg tablets, 3 to 4 tablets in the morning and 3 to 4 tablets at night time. In addition, I called her in a prescription for Ultram 50-mg tablets, dispensing 40 tablets, 1 tablet q. 6 to 8 hours p.r.n. pain, refill x3. Hopefully, this will allow her to navigate in her car much better. She says she can also take Darvocet, but we will try the Ultram first. She is to keep me informed of her progress.

She does need some crowns on her posterior teeth, and she has contacted the dentist to do this. She will inform us and return to see me sometime in the near future.

B273 
B273 presents for 2-year postsurgical followup. Her occlusion is good and her facial balance and aesthetics look very good. Her primary concerns are as follows:

A bump on the left side of her face.
Pain throughout most of the head and neck area, but worse on the left side.
She does have an enlarged lymph node overlying the left parotid gland that is mobile and she has tenderness associated with it, but I believe the tenderness is due more so to the underlying masseter muscle that is exclusively tender in other areas besides directly over the enlarged lymph nodes. To palpation, she has extremely high pain over the temporalis, masseters, SCMs, posterior neck, retromandibular and TMJ areas, being worse on the left side than the right side. She also has some moderate pain to palpation with the left medial pterygoid and shoulders. On pushing up at the angle of the mandible on the left side, she has very strong pain in the TMJ joint. On the right side, she does not experience this level of discomfort and pain. I believe that she likely has a neuroma in the left TMJ joint area. This is causing localized pain and could possibly be referring pain also down through the masseter muscles.

Based on clinical and radiographic, B273's diagnoses are as follows:
Probable neuroma in left TMJ. Generalized severe myositis.
Treatment options would be as follows:

Medications. Increase Klonopin to 0.5 to 1 mg q.h.s.
Magnesium 250-mg tablets, 2 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets in the evening. Consider surgery.
Left TMJ exploration and debridement with removal of neuroma left TMJ. Removal of hypertrophied lymph node overlying left parotid gland.
Fat graft to the TMJ with abdominal fat graft.

She is to keep me informed on how she does with the changes in medications.
