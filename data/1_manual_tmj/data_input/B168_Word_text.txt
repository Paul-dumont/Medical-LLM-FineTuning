B168 12/22/2009
DOB: 09/27/1993
B168 is referred by Dr. XXXX. B168 is 16 years old. Primary concerns are as follows:
Headaches.
Muscle aches and pains. Clicking and popping in the jaw joints. Difficulties breathing through the nose creating predominantly a mouth breathing situation. Snoring.
Daytime somnolence.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B168 has fairly good left-to-right facial asymmetry. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth relationship is 5 mm on the left and 3 mm on the right. The maxillary midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline may be about 1 mm off to the left as is the chin. In profile view, B168 shows some AP maxillary deficiency of probably 3-4 mm. The chin is retruded by 20 mm. Chin neckline is very short and chin neck angle is moderately well defined. Intraorally, B168 has all of his teeth back through the second molars erupted in position. He has thin but adequately attached gingiva. The lower teeth appear fairly well aligned. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. On the right side, he has an ankylosis maxillary right cuspid and some of his teeth have been pulled up in that direction. He has an anterior open bite of about 2 mm on the left side and 4 mm on the right side. In the cuspid area, he has got about a 5 mm open bite. Otherwise, he is fairly close to a Class I cuspid-molar relationship on the left side with just a Class III on the right side by probably 2 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues looks relatively normal. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. Nasal airway probably has a moderate to severe obstruction. Columella is wide and nostril are narrow. It is noted he has some crackling noises that could be related to anterior or medially displaced discs. The discs are thin on the MRI. To palpation, B168 has some moderate pain over the masseter muscles and mild tenderness over the retromandibular area and posterior neck area. Maximum incisal opening is about 48 mm, excursion movement to the right 5 mm, to the left 6 mm. On opening and closing, he has some crackling noises in his joints and occasionally he will pop in the right side.

Previous treatment he has had includes a BioBlock from the age of 9 to 11. He had physical therapy to initiate good lip closure at age 11. He had an NIT splint in 2009 that did not relieve his symptoms. He has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother him. He is not aware of clenching or bruxism. He gets daily headaches that he rates at a level of 7 in the temporal area. He has no direct TMJ pain and rates his average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 2, diet at 2, disability at 4.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of four bony impacted third molars. All the rest of the teeth are present. Sinuses look reasonably clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size.

Left TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology with a little bit of anterior beaking present. Joint space appears fairly equal.

Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking. articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be reasonable joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably a good 4-5 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view likewise shows significantly decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 4-5 mm. The condyle has fairly good morphology.

Coronal view shows that he has some mildly hypertrophied turbinates. Sinuses look relatively clear. Septum is reasonably straight, but he does have a small spur sticking off to the left side.

Axial view shows that he has moderately enlarged turbinates that certainly could be causing some airway obstruction.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B168 has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology. He has a got a retruded maxilla and mandible. He has a high occlusal plane angle. He has a significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of only about 2.5 mm.

Diagnoses for B168 would be as follows:
1. Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation anteriorly and medially with reduction.
2. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
3. AP mandibular hypoplasia.
4. AP macrogenia.
5. High occlusal plane angle.
6. Anterior open bite of 3 mm on the left and 5 mm on the right.
7. Ankylosed maxillary right cuspid.
8. Impacted third molars x4.
9. Hypertrophied turbinates.
10. Nasal airway obstruction.
11. Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 2.5 to 3 mm (normal 11 mm).
12. Headaches.
13. Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch in different occlusal plane levels. Align the left cuspid through second molar in one plane with a step in the arch wire to then align the left lateral incisor around to the ankylosis right cuspid with a vertical step in the arch wire and then align the right bicuspids and molars. This will increase the cant in the anterior maxillary arch. Tip the maxillary left lateral incisor mesially and cuspid root distally to make room for interdental osteotomy. On the right side keep the first bicuspid root tipped distally from the cuspid root. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2. Surgery. a. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to level off the maxillary occlusal plane in 3 segments and decrease the occlusal plane angle as well as advance the maxilla approximately 5 mm. c.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. d.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to advance the chin. e.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. f.	Surgical removal of 4 impacted third molars.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

An alterative treatment would be to do the surgery in two stages with a first stage to align and level the maxillary arch. This would include the following:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch in different occlusal plane levels. Align the left cuspid through second molar in one plane with step in the arch wire to then align the left lateral incisor around to the ankylosis right cuspid with a step in the arch wire and then align the right bicuspids and molars. This will increase the cant in the maxillary arch. Tip the maxillary left lateral incisor mesially and cuspid root distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. On the right side keep the first bicuspid root tipped distally from the cuspid root. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2. Surgery stage 1. a	Maxillary osteotomies to rotate the anterior maxillary segment from left lateral incisor through right cuspid down into occlusion. b.	Continue to align and level maxillary arch. c.	Continue to align and level the mandible arch.
3. Surgery stage 2. a.	Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, reposition the anterior aspect superiorly and posterior aspect inferiorly to decrease occlusal plane angle. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance he mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to advance the chin forward. d.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e.	Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
