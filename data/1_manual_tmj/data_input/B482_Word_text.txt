B482 
B482  is 19 years 11 months old. She was referred by Dr. XX. She has had long standing TMJ problems, but have only become significantly symptomatic in the past 2 ½ years. B482 has had two previous rounds of orthodontics.

When B482 got her braces off the first time at about the age of 13, she had some slight facial asymmetry but not really noticeable. Therefore when she was 14 and 15 years old, it showed general progression in increasing the facial asymmetry.

In frontal view B482 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Some slight asymmetry with the nose but not too significant. Upper lip length is 20 mm, upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 6 on the left and 5 on the right. Nasal tip is off to the right side probably by 3 mm. Maxillary dental midline is off to the right by a mm but the roots are off to the left probably 3 to 4 mm. Maxillary central incisors may be fairly close to being on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted off to the right probably 2 mm. Chin midline is shifted off to the right almost 10 mm. As she shifts her mandible towards the left side probably about 5 to 6 mm, chin is significantly symmetric. She does have about 10 mm of lip incompetence. She has a little prominence on the nasal dorsum. Upper lip appears to be retruded by about 3 to 4 mm at point A. Chin-neckline is short although the chin-neck angle is reasonably well defined. The chin is slightly retruded by about 15 mm. The lower third face appears excessively long particularly in the mandibular aspect. Intraorally, B482 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars presents and also all teeth are present in the upper arch. She has basically a Class I cuspid relationship bilaterally and about a 1 mm overbite relationship. She has more fullness in the left angle of her mandible than the right side. Fullness may run about 3 to 4 mm. There is transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left maxillary cuspid being 5 mm lower than the right maxillary cuspid. As B482 bites together her right side teeth touch before the left side. She has a significant posterior yaw in the maxilla and mandible with the jaws being rotated to the left probably a good 3 or perhaps 4 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and the uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all appear normal. Tonsils are present and they appear normal. She had an adenoidectomy at the age of 2. Intranasally, she has a severely deviated nasal septum off towards the left side, which almost completely obliterates the left nasal airway. The right side is wide open and causes severe deviation of the nasal septum. There is actually a crease horizontally though the septum that is probably an area of separation between the bone and the cartilage. I do not believe it is complete perforation but the tissues do look quite thin in that area. The columella and nostrils as well as the nasal valves all look normal. Turbinates are probably moderate enlargement. To palpation, B482 has no tenderness around the head and neck area except for some very mild tenderness over the shoulders. Joints seem to function reasonably well though there are some glitches within the joint. She does hypertranslate so it is difficult to tell if the pops in the jaws are related to discs or articular eminence factors. It appears that on closing there is some kind of a glitch in the right joint with probably 25 to 30 mm of opening. On the left side there is a click at about 35 mm of opening and around 30 mm of closing. Maximal incisal opening is about 53 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 4 mm and to the left 8 mm. The left inferior border of the mandible appears to be 5 to 6 mm lower than the right side.  

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars. All other teeth are present. There appears to be a little bit of fluid in the left side but hard to tell but the right side appears reasonably clear. The right condyle appears somewhat arthritic and much shorter in vertical height as compared to the left side. Vertical height of the ramus in the first molar area appears reasonably equal from one side to the other side.

Waters view shows severe deviation of the nasal septum off towards the left side with a large bony spur extending even further off to the left side. Right turbinate appears enlarged although there is some airway because of severe deviation of the nasal septum. The left side appears totally obliterated and the turbinate appears moderately enlarged. Sinuses actually look relatively clear. The maxillary left sinus is larger than the maxillary right sinus probably due to the difference in vertical elongation of the alveolar bone.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condylar head and neck that appears somewhat elongated. Decreased joint space vertically. A little bit of flattening on the posterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ tomogram shows decreased joint space vertically. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Decreased joint space anteriorly. On one of the x-rays there is an artifact present and it makes the image non-readable relative to the condyle. On two of the images, one of closed views and one of the open views on the right TMJ, there is a circle that is opacified over the condyle. It appears more than likely to be artifact but difficult to rule out something else.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a slight increased occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway appears adequate. There are two different occlusal plane levels. Interestingly, the inferior borders appear to be fairly well aligned with each other.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Left TMJ condylar hyperplasia versus osteoma versus osteochondroma.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and severe deformation. Left TMJ articular disc medially and anteriorly dislocated.
Right TMJ intracondylar lesion measuring 3.5 x 5 mm.
Severe transverse facial asymmetry.
Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 5 mm lower than the right side.
Class I occlusion. Anterior maxillary vertical excess.
Anterior mandibular vertical excess. AP microgenia. Maxillary midline 1 mm to the right, mandibular dental midline 2 to 3 mm to the right, chin 10 mm to the right, nasal tip 2 to 3 mm to the right. Severely deviated nasal septum. 

Hypertrophied turbinates. Severe nasal airway obstruction on the left side. TMJ pain. Headaches. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Significant lip incompetence of 10 mm. External nasal deformity.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Presurgical orthodontics. Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Left TMJ low condylectomy and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Left TMJ articular repositioning and repair with Mitek anchor versus total joint prosthesis. Bilateral TMJ sagittal split osteotomies to counterclockwise rotate and correct asymmetry.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to level transverse occlusal plane and move the maxilla superiorly. Vertical reduction AP augmentation genioplasty. Nasal septoplasty.
Partial inferior turbinectomies. External rhinoplasty. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. It appears there may be some discal tissue medially perhaps. Decreased superior joint space is present. Decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm. It appears that there is discal tissue anterior to the condyle. There appears to be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is significantly small in size than the left condyle. There appears to be decreased superior joint space. There appears to be discal tissue medial to the condyle. There also appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. Decreased lateral joint space. There is a hot spot in the condyle that appears quite unusual and is just lateral to the mid sagittal plane. This is also located about 3 to 4 mm below the coronal top of the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to be a pretty good size. The condylar head appears apparently long in length. There appears to be decreased joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medial there appears to be better vertical height of the joint space. Articular eminence is sort of moderate in steepness, but is slightly elongated. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior oint space. On opening, the articular disc appears to reduce and there appears to be good translation of both the condyle and the articular disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears as though it has undergone some resorption. There is anterior beaking present. Decreased joint space vertically. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence and significantly deformed. It has lost considerable anteroposterior length and has the appearance of almost the shape of a small bean. Of interest is that inside the condylar head there is quite a hot spot that measures about 3.5 mm x 5 mm. This could be a cystic spot or some kind of a small vascular lesion. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle and the articular disc appears to remain anteriorly displaced without reduction. The intracondylar lesion appears to be positioned proximally 4 mm below the top part of the condyle. There is fluid in the anterosuperior joint space.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ and slightly enlarged condyle, articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced, but reduces on opening. Rule out condylar hyperplasia versus osteoma. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and non-reducing. Intracondylar lesion measuring 3.5 x 5 mm.
