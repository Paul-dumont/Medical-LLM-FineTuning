DATE OF INTERPRETATION:	
The quality of the MRIs is not very good.

Left TMJ MRI shows a condyle that appears to be a little short in vertical height perhaps. The joint space looks reasonably good, but difficult to identify discal tissue. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat with virtually no downward curvature.

Right TMJ condyle also that it may be a little bit short in vertical height. There is a little bit less joint space on this side. It is difficult to identify where the discs are. There is a very flat lateral rim of the fossa.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis and a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced and in a vertical orientation in the joint space. There is fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. The left condyle has limited translation. The disc does not appear to move significantly. It may be adhesed to the fossa as well. The condyle has limited translation and it stops along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little sclerosis on the top and a little bit of anterior beaking. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and in a vertical orientation within the joint space. There is decreased posterior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the joint space, but not quite as much as the opposite side. On opening, there is restricted translation in the joint. The disc does not appear to move and movement appears to be between the condyle and the disc. The disc may be adhesed to the fossa. The condyle has restricted translation.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with early reduction but with adhesions of the discs to the fossa.
B315  I 

B315 is 33 years old. She is in good health. B315's TMJ problems began 2 months ago, when she was involved in a motorbike accident where she flipped over the handlebars and struck her chin on the cement. She did go to the emergency room and there were no fractures identified. She was referred to Dr. __ and he likewise took additional x-rays and no fractures were identified. She continued to have significant pain problems and limited jaw opening. A month ago, she was put under anesthesia and her jaws were manipulated with apparently good mobility with Dr. __ manipulating the mandible while she was asleep. She was then sent to physical therapy with __ who is a TMJ physical therapy specialist. The physical therapy made her pain worse with headaches, TMJ pain and severe neck and shoulder pain. He referred her to Dr. __, who is an orthopedic spine specialist. An angiogram was done and that was negative. B315 has significant problems with vertigo and nausea. Although she has bilateral pain, it is worse on the right side. Few weeks ago, she underwent right arthroscopy and manipulation of the jaws as well as steroid injections into the right joint. She has had no improvement and, in fact, she feels worse now with increased pain and limited jaw function, than before the procedure. The severe pain and jaw dysfunction is severely affecting her abilities function at work and in all other aspects of her life.

B315 currently takes the following medications:
Celebrex 200 mg tablets one per day. Hydrocodone 5/325 which she takes about one tablet at night currently. She previously was on a liquid form where she was taking 2 to 4 tsp. every 4 hours and this did not control her pain. Tramadol 50 mg six tablets per day. Cyclobenzaprine 5 mg one to two times per day. Klonopin 0.5 mg one tablet b.i.d. Zolpidem 5 mg at bedtime. B315 rates her headaches that are continuous and are in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area at a level of 6 on the right side and at a level of 4 on the left side. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 6, jaw function at 6, diet at 8, disability at 5. She gets earaches, tinnitus, and vertigo. She also experiences significant problems with nausea. The only other joint that bothers her is her neck vertebrae. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B315 has good facial balance. She also has good balance in profile. B315 has all of her teeth except for her wisdom teeth which were removed previously. She has basically just a slight Class II occlusal relationship of about 1 to 2 mm and has about a 3 mm anterior overbite relationship. B315 has high moderate to severe pain around the head and neck area with it being a little bit worse on the right side. Maximum incisal opening is 22 mm and opening without pain 5 mm. Excursion movement to the right is 0 and to the left about 1.5 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a root canal on the maxillary right first molar. It is difficult to evaluate the joints. Sinuses appear reasonably clear.

Coronal view shows that she has moderately enlarged turbinates, but sinuses appear clear.
Axial view shows that the turbinates are large particularly on the right side, but the sinuses are clear.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with some anterior beaking present and an increased anterior joint space. The articular eminence is fairly steep.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit more centered in the joint. The articular eminence is fairly steep. There is a little bit of anterior beaking on the condyle in one of the views.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. The joint space may be slightly decreased particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is fairly reasonable superior joint space.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B315 basically has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship, and she has a good oropharyngeal airway.

Because of her bike injury and unsuccessful previous treatments that included physical therapy (which made her condition worse) and arthroscopic surgery (which also has made her situation worse), she is now suffering from severe pain around the head and neck area all related to the traumatic injury. She is becoming progressively more debilitated. She is an event organizer and planner. She is having significant difficulties carrying out her responsibilities. She is becoming ineffective at her workplace because of her severe pain problems. She cannot even open her mouth wide enough to even think about getting impressions for splint therapy. Her incisal opening is only 22 mm maximum. She likely has close locks in both TMJs.

Based on clinical, radiographic, and MRI analyses, B315's diagnoses are as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction. Relative mandibular hyperplasia.
Severe myofascial pain.
TMJ pain. Continuous headaches. Earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, and nausea.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc respositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain the occlusion. c.	Application of maxillary and mandibular arch bars.
2.	Postsurgical physical therapy.

I gave her a prescription for Lortab liquid 2.5 mg/5 mL, dispensing 500 mL, 4 to 6 tsp. q.4 hours p.r.n. pain, refill x2.

The patient presents for final presurgical workup. Final records were taken. History and physical performed and consent form reviewed and signed. I answered all the questions that she and her boyfriend Jim Trungale had. She is ready for surgery tomorrow.
