B494 
She is a self-referral. Her TMJ problems began when she was about 17 years old 39 years ago. Doctors thought she might have had a fracture after she fell and hit her chin. Probably her TMJ pathology had already begun taking place at that time. 23 years ago, she had a right TMJ arthroscopy. 12 years ago, she had bilateral arthroplasties performed with an ear cartilage graft to the left TMJ. She had physical therapy throughout 20-ish years ago. From 7 to 10 years ago, she had orthodontic treatment including a Herbst appliance for 1 year. Currently, biweekly she is getting massage therapy, acupuncture treatments, chiropractic treatment. She has had x3 Lidocaine injections and trigger points in the shoulders, neck, skull and face.

B494 rates her headaches at 8 predominantly in the right side in the frontal and perhaps the temporal area, but in the posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 6, diet at 4, disability at 8. She gets earaches frequently on the left side, but has no tinnitus nor vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her knees, toes, fingers, and neck. SHE IS ALLERGIC TO SULFA MEDICATIONS AND TO PENICILLIN. She has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, and depression. She has mildly elevated blood pressure. She has severe snoring, moderate daytime somnolence, but has not been evaluated for sleep apnea. She has a mild sleep disorder and moderate occurrence of mouth breathing when she sleeps. B494 does have some sleep apnea issues witnessed by her husband. She has not had a sleep study yet. She does get Lidocaine injections through her neck and shoulder areas and sometimes in the masseter muscles and in the mastoid areas and upper neck administered by her husband.

In frontal view, B494 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. The maxillary midline is about 1.5 mm off to the right side as is the mandibular dental midline and chin is probably 2 mm off to the right side. In profile view, B494 has an AP deficiency in the maxilla of about 5 mm and in the chin of about 15 mm. The chin neckline and chin neck angle are not defined. Intraorally, B494 has significant crowding in the lower anterior arch. She is missing mandibular right bicuspids and at least the first molar. On the left side, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. In the upper arch, she is missing the right second and third molars and left second third molars. She has a Class II end-on occlusion being probably 2 to 3 mm Class II. She has an over jet of about 2 to 3 mm. There is a deep bite of about 4 mm. Moderate pain over the left medial pterygoid, left retromandibular area, left SCM, right shoulder, and milder tenderness over the temporalis muscles, masseters, right medial pterygoid, right retromandibular area, and right SCM. The maximal incisal opening is 38 mm, opening without significant discomfort 35 mm. The right excursion movement is 4 mm and left excursion movement 5 mm. Orally, she has a bifed uvula. Soft palate looked reasonably normal in length, but I could not see or evaluate the fascial pillars or the tonsils. Intranasally, the turbinates look relatively normal in size. The septum is reasonably straight. Columella has some moderate increased width to it and the nostrils are somewhat narrow. Transversely, the right maxillary cuspid may be about 1 mm higher than the left side and the lower arch is fairly level.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the maxillary second third molars bilaterally, mandibular third molars, and mandibular right bicuspids and first molar. She has crowns in almost all the posterior teeth. The condyle show severe condylar resorption.

Coronal view shows that the septum appears reasonably straight, but the turbinates appear fairly large. The sinuses appear clear.
Axial view shows that the septum is fairly straight. The turbinates are moderately enlarged and sinuses are clear.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a severe destruction in the joint with flattening of the head of the condyle and loss of vertical volume. The articular eminence is fairly flat. There is a sharp posterior osteophytic kind of formation off the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption with almost complete loss of the neck of the condyle as well. The articular eminence also is resorbed.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe condylar resorption. There appears to be increased joint space towards the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, there is closer potential bone-on-bone contact. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption. Lateral pole of the condyle is significantly lower than what is left of the medial pole. The condyle is almost spike-like extending upwards towards the fossa. The lateral rim curves inferiorly probably about 2 to 3 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a retruded maxilla and mandible with a high occlusal plane angle. There is significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of about 3 mm at the soft palate level and about 4 mm at the base of the tongue.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ rheumatoid arthritis.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm (normal AP dimension 11 mm).
Sleep apnea.
TMJ pain. Mpofascial pain.
Headaches.
Left-sided earache.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2.	CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
3.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance and counterclockwise rotate the maxilla. c.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.	Bilateral coronoidotomies.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

She has significant problems with depression and has even had suicidal considerations. She apparently has had some significant death problems in her family in the last year or so as well as a suicide of her brother. She is somewhat distraught and has the feeling that nothing can be done to help her.

DATE OF ACQUISITION:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe condylar resorption and degenerative changes. The disc is not readily identifiable. There appears to be some fluid in the medial aspect of the superior joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption. The condyle is very narrow mediolateral. Difficult to find discal tissue.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption. There are a lot of degenerative changes in the joint and fluid in the superior joint space. The imaging is compatible with rheumatoid arthritis. The articular eminence is fairly flat. There is increased thickness of the soft tissues between the condyle and the fossa. The condyle is postured somewhat forward in the fossa. There is some type of odd soft tissue structure in the posterior aspect of the joint behind the condyle that extends from the roof of the fossa down to the posterior articular wall. On opening, there is virtually no translation of the condyle. The condyle itself is quite flattened and has some areas of sclerosis and there is anterior beaking present. The condyle appears to be articulating almost on the articular eminence.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption. The articular eminence is much flatter on this side than the opposite side. There is increased tissue thickness between the condyle and the fossa. The condyle is also postured forward in the fossa. There is really very minimal translation of the right condyle. The head of the condyle is quite flattened and in some areas there does appear to be some anterior beaking. This condyle appears to be functioning almost beneath the articular eminence.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis with destruction of the articular disc, condyle, and articular eminence compatible with rheumatoid arthritis.
