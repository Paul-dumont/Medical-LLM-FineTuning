B144
B144 is 48 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX.
B144 has had clicking and popping in her jaw joints for as long as she can remember of unknown etiology. There was a possible etiology when she was 5 years of age. At that age, she fell off her bike, went over the handlebars and landed on her chin. She has no problems with headaches or TMJ pain. She does get some significant pain at about a level of 6 to 7 in her left neck area particularly when she has to turn her head towards the left side. She rates her jaw function at 0, diet at 5, disability at 2. She has a paresthesia to the lower right lip and chin area that occurred as a result of third molar removal 13 years ago. Her TMJ problems got significantly worse after a total hysterectomy 4 years ago. The next day she developed significant jaw pain that she describes as being hooked up to an electrical wire. This progressed to where she could hardly talk. She saw several doctors and finally was referred to a dentist who made her a splint. This improved her situation until the splint broke and the dentist repaired it, but at that point it was pushing her lower jaw backwards and making her pain more intense. She then went to Dr. XXXX at Stanford who made a daytime and nighttime splint for her and placed her on some medications but that resulted in her having panic attacks. Her lower teeth became loose as a result of the daytime and nighttime splint wearing. She subsequently saw several other people and finally settled with Dr. XXXX. Dr. XXXX was able to make B144's splint that resolved most of her problems and got her more comfortable except for the residual neck problem. Dr. XXXX then placed orthodontic appliances on the upper teeth and aligned them and then adjust the splint and placed appliances on the lower teeth. She apparently has a posterior open bite and using vertical elastics could not be tolerated by B144. She has probably some turbos placed on her lower teeth to keep her jaws from closing all the way. She currently has braces on the lower teeth and wears a retainer on the upper teeth. So, currently she has braces on the lower teeth, turbos on the lower posterior teeth, and a retainer in the upper arch.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B144 has fairly good facial balance. She may have just some slight increased fullness in her right mandibular ramus angle area of probably about 3 mm or so. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 1 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile, B144 has good facial balance. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has turbos on the second molars, second and first bicuspids. She has some mild crowding of the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has a retainer in place and all of her teeth back through the second molars. She is fairly close to being a Class I cuspid, although just slightly Class III probably by 1 mm. She has about 1 mm of vertical overbite. She probably has a posterior open bite of about 2 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Intranasally, the right turbinate appears somewhat enlarged and the left one appears a little bit more normal. There is some deviation in the septum, but not real severe. Columella is wide and nostrils are relatively narrow. She does have a history of mild snoring, mild daytime somnolence, mild sleep apnea, and a mild sleep disorder. She is not aware of particularly being a mouth breather at night. In the left TMJ, there is a click at about 10-15 mm of opening and a closing click at about 5-10 mm. B144 has bilateral posterior open bites of about almost 4-5 mm on the left side and about 3 mm on the right side. She is actually fairly close to being a Class I cuspid relationship, but slight Class III molar relationship. The right side seems relatively smooth at this time. Incisal opening is 52 mm. Excursion movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 9 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars but all the rest of the teeth are present. There appears to be a large septal spur extending off to the left side. Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear with a just a little thick mucosa lining at the bottom of the sinuses. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. Septum deviates off towards the left side. Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. Right turbinate appears enlarged and may contribute to some of the nasal airway obstruction. Left TMJ sagittal view shows condyle that is a little bit posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.
Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that demonstrates a decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is a little flattening on the anterior head but not too significant. A little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Left TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle that with fairly good mediolateral width. There is a little extension of the lateral pole of the condyle out lateral. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly only about 1-2 mm at the most. There is decreased vertical joint space. Right TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm. There is significantly decreased joint space on this side and particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there appears to be decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of about 6 mm at the base of the tongue and about the same at the soft palate level. In the radiograph taken by Park X-ray Laboratory on 22 month ago, B144 has about an 11-mm airway space at the soft palate level and about 8 mm at the base of the tongue. In our x-ray, her head posture appears to be excessively abnormal with the head and neck tilted backwards.

Basic diagnoses for B144 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis but articular discs displaced with early reduction. Bilateral posterior open bites controlled with turbos on the second molars, second bicuspids and first bicuspids. Crowding in the lower anterior arch. Probable tooth size discrepancy (no models were available at the time of evaluation). Neuroma right inferior alveolar nerve.
Paresthesia of right chin and right side of mandible but currently asymptomatic relative to pain but with persistent anesthesia.
Wide columella and narrow nostrils.
Mild sleep apnea. Moderately enlarged right turbinate.
Slight deviation of the nasal septum off to the left side but with a relatively large septal spur at the middle turbinate level off to the left side.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth to correct for the tooth size discrepancy and to keep from flaring the lower incisors too far forward. Surgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain occlusal relationship. Reconstruct columella to narrow and increase nostril size. Postsurgical orthodontics.
Initially obtain occlusion with the first molars and bicuspids.
Remove turbos and erupt the second molars into occlusion.
Finish and retain.

AGE: DOB:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is a little sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There is decreased superior joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat curving only 1-2 mm inferiorly. There may be discal tissue anterior and lateral to the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is a little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. There is a decrease vertical joint space and a little roughness towards the lateral aspect of the condyle. The disc on this side may be anteriorly and medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology with some flattening on the anterior head, and a little bit of sclerosis on top, and some slight anterior beaking. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced but in a vertical orientation and in a probable pre-click position. In the left joint, there is some fluid in the superior joint space, but more in the inferior joint space anterior to the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the anterior head and may have some slight anterior beaking present. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. The disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting in a vertical orientation and adjacent to the mildly high inclination of the articular eminence. There likewise may be in a pre-click position of displacement. On opening, there appears to be an early reduction of the disc and condyle with moderately good translation of both condyles and both articular discs. In the right TMJ, there is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space and inferior joint space.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with very early reduction..
