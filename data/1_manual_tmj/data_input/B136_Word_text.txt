B136
B136 is 43 years old. Referred by Dr. XXXX, and also XXXX.
To the best of B136's recollection, her problems began in about 27 years ago when her jaw would start to click and pop and sometimes lock. Twenty-seven years ago, she saw Dr. XXXX, who did bilateral disc repositioning procedures. The right side apparently did okay, but the left side became displaced again, and, 2 years later, the left side was done again and this time a Proplast Teflon interpositional implant placed. She then saw Dr. XXXX 23 years ago, and he removed the PTIPI and placed a temporal fascia graft. She continued to have severe pain. Two years later, she then came back to Dallas to see Dr. XXXX who debrided the left joint and did a right joint exploration. Twenty-one years ago, Dr. XXXX went back in and debrided the left joint once again. Eight years ago, she saw Dr. XXXX who placed a left Walter Lorenz total joint prosthesis. Her pain and swelling has continued since that time. She has been suffering pain and problems since then. She is currently seeing a pain doctor. She currently takes the following medications:

Lyrica 75 mg 3 times per day. Celebrex 200 mg q.d.
OxyContin 40-mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets twice a day. Baclofen 10 mg t.i.d.
Axert 12.5 mg p.r.n. Amrix 15 mg q.d. as a muscle relaxant.

She gets headaches frequently at a level of 5 predominantly in the left temporal and posterior head area. Five to six times a week she gets rather severe migraines that escalate to a level of 8 to 9. Her average daily pain is around 7. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 5, disability at 8. She gets no earaches, tinnitus, or vertigo and has no hearing loss. Other joints that bother include her neck and her upper back area. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing. She does smoke half a pack of cigarettes per day.

B136 recently has undergone some dental implants and some dental reconstruction and this was completed about 2 weeks ago.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B136 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. The facial midlines and dental midlines are all pretty much aligned, although the nasal tip may be just slightly off to the right side. In profile view, B136 has fairly good facial symmetry and balance. Intraorally, she has had lower restorative work done with replacing teeth back through the second bicuspids. The molars are missing. In the upper arch, she has had some extensive work done on the left side and second molar on the right side. Bite is fairly close to being Class I cuspid. In trying to place her into centric relation, she has significant pain in the left cheek area and the midlines do not line up. The mandibular dental midline appears about 1 mm off towards the left side. She does have some appreciable swelling in the left cheek area over by the malar eminence and likely detachment of the masseter muscle. She also has a little bit of swelling back more towards the ear along the zygomatic arch. Intranasally, the left turbinate appears a little large right now. She says at times she hears squeaking noises in the left jaw joint. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows that B136 is missing all of her permanent teeth. She has 5 implants in the mandibular arch to replace the lower teeth back to the second bicuspids. In the upper arch, she has 6 implants with 5 of them loaded to replace all the teeth from the second molar on the right side around to the first molar on the left side. There is an implant in the second molar area, but there has been no crown placed on that tooth yet. Right TMJ appears a little bit arthritic. The left joint has a Walter Lorenz total joint prosthesis in place with 6 screws holding the mandibular component and 4 screws holding the maxillary component. Axial view shows that the turbinates do not appear too large in size. There is a small spur off the right side of the septum. Coronal view shows that the turbinates are not too enlarged and the airway is reasonably good. The nasal septum is deviated off towards the right side slightly. Left TMJ sagittal view shows the presence of a Walter Lorenz total joint prosthesis. There may be some reactive heterotopic bone around the prosthesis. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit arthritic with some flattening of the posterior head. There appears to be significantly decreased joint space between the condyle and the articular eminence. The condyle appears to be postured slightly forward in the fossa. Left TMJ coronal view shows the mandibular component present and also the upper component can be seen. It appears somewhat thin. There could be some heterotopic bone growing down around the inside of the fossa component. Right TMJ coronal view shows that in some areas there appears to be reasonably good joint space around the condyle. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she probably has reasonably good facial balance and airway looks reasonably good.

Incisal opening is 30 mm, but only 23 mm without severe pain. Excursion movements are only about 1 mm in each direction. To palpation, she has severe pain over the left masseter; high moderate pain over the left TMJ, left posterior neck pain; moderate pain over the styloid areas, right TMJ, and right masseter area.

Basic diagnoses for B136 would be as follows:
Right TMJ failed Walter Lorenz total joint prosthesis. Heterotopic bone formation around the left TMJ prosthesis. Foreign body giant cell reaction around the left TMJ prosthesis.
Right TMJ arthritis and disc dislocation. Severe TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Masticatory dysfunction. Recommended treatment would be as follows:

MRI of right TMJ to evaluate degree of arthritis and articular disc position. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Removal of left TMJ failed Walter Lorenz total joint prosthesis.
Extensive debridement of left TMJ including removal of heterotopic bone, foreign body giant cell reaction, and fibrosis.
Bilateral TMJ versus left TMJ (depending on MRI evaluation) reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Fat grafts to TMJs (harvest from the abdomen).
Application of maxillary and mandibular arch bars. Any dental reconstruction that may be necessary to finalize the occlusion.

B136 MRI AGE: DOB:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There is a depression in the mid-part of the condyle. It is difficult to see discal tissue between the condyle and fossa. The left TMJ has a total joint prosthesis present. It is difficult to evaluate any translation in the joint prosthesis.

Right TMJ shows the presence of a total joint prosthesis with metal-on-metal occlusion likely a Christensen prosthesis. There is a little bit of fluid in the joint space. It is difficult to evaluate for any translation in the joint. There is some restricted translation in the condyle with it coming down just along the posterior slope of the articular eminence and not down beneath it.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of arthritis with some anterior beaking. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears it may be in position, although does appear to be some degenerative changes associated with it. There is some slight amount of fluid in the superior joint space. There is flattening on the posterior head of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ total joint prosthesis with metal-on-metal articulation. Right TMJ arthritis, but articular disc appears to be in position, though with degenerative changes.

B136 MRI AGE: DOB:
Left TMJ coronal view has a total joint prostheses in position.
Right TMJ coronal view shows some advanced arthritis on the condylar head. There is an erosion and depression in the head of the condyle in the mid to lateral aspect of the joint. There appears to be a hot spot of inflammation within the joint. Lateral rim of the fossa is flat. There appears to be decreased joint space medially. There are some areas of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. It is difficult to identify discal tissue.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows the presence of a prosthesis with difficulty identifying the individual structures. There appears to be a lot of metal artifact present.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic. There is flattening on the posterior head of the condyle. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced, although there is some scarred fibrotic tissue over the top of the condyle. There appear to be some bony degeneration on the posterior slope of the articular eminence. Medially, it appears that there is almost bone-on-bone contact.

In the T-2 films, the disc seems to be anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. There appears to be compressed tissue between the condyle and the fossa, probably related to previous surgical intervention. The disc is extremely short anteroposteriorly and not sufficient to cover the head of the condyle. There is noted translation. In the open view, the discal tissue looks very degenerated. The articular disc appears to be adhesed to the articular eminence.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ total joint prostheses.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with significant degeneration and deformation with limited translation with the remnants of the disc adhesed to the articular eminence.
