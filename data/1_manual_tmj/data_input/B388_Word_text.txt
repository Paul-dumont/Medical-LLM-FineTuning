B388 
B388 is 11 years, referred by Dr. . B388 has some significant allergy problems. She has very sensitive skin and is even bothered by her cheerleading outfit. She has had a lot of problems with sinusitis and drainage particularly these past two months. Currently she takes amoxicillin and hydroxyzine. B388 does not have any problems with earaches, tinnitus or hearing loss. She gets occasional dizziness but she thinks this may be due to the medications, particularly hydroxyzine. The other joints that bother her include her knees and perhaps her back a little bit. She does have a lot of allergies. She is not aware of clenching or grinding her teeth at night.

Her TMJ problems began about 1 year ago of unknown etiology. She has had no treatment to date. She gets headaches about 2 times per week that occur in her frontal and temple areas at about a level of 7. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 7, diet at 6, disability at 6. Her jaws get stuck everyday in between so that she cannot open or close her jaws. In frontal view, B388 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is mandibular dental midline and chin.

In profile view, she has good balance between the upper lip, cheeks and nose. The chin appears retruded by probably about 8 to 10 mm. Chin-neckline is short and it appears she has a head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, she has mixed dentition. She has incisors, cuspids and first bicuspids in. She has retained Es in the lower arch and has first molars coming in. In the upper arch the cuspids have not come in yet but the first bicuspid on the right side is in. She has retained D&E on the left side and E on the right side. First molars are in. She has Class II end-on occlusal relationship on the right side and closer to a Class I on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. Oropharyngeal airway looks good. The uvula is mildly enlarged but not too significant. Soft palate may be a little bit elongated. Faucial pillars are somewhat constricted. The tonsils appear normal in size. B388 has extremely large turbinates and this may be contributing to her allergies and her airway dysfunction. To palpation, she has high moderate to low severe pain around the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, SCMs, shoulders and moderate discomfort over the medial pterygoids, styloids and posterior neck area. On opening, she has bilateral clicks of about 10 mm and closing click of 5 mm. On excursion she has bilateral clicking in both joints. Maximal incisal opening is 55 mm but opening without much discomfort is only 30 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 12 mm, to the left 11 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows retained primary Es in the lower arch and Es in the upper arch as well as a D in the maxillary left quadrant. All teeth appear to be accounted for. The second and third molars are developing but unerupted. Turbinates appear large. The sinuses look relatively clear. The left condyle appears a little flattened anteriorly. The right side looks a little bit better but difficult to tell.

Waters view shows that there appears to be significant deviation in the nasal septum. Head is a little bit over-tilted so it is difficult to assess the turbinates but they do appear large. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows some flattening on the anterior head. Decreased posterior joint space and superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Slight increased anterior joint space. The condyle has a little bit of a hockey stick shape to it.  

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is little bit harder to evaluate than the opposite side. There appears to be decreased superior and posterior joint space. There may be a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and a little bit of peaking in the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Increased anterior joint space is present. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles with the right side showing a little bit more translation than the left side. The condyle does come out beneath the articular eminence on the left side and beyond the articular eminence on the right side.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B388 has some adenoid tissues present in the nasal pharynx. Turbinates extend just slightly beyond the hard palate. Oropharyngeal airway looks fairly good. Occlusal plane is slightly increased in angle. There is AP microgenia present.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation (possible ICR.)
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency. AP microgenia. Class II end-on occlusion on the right side with basic Class I on the left. Slight division II malocclusion.
Retained primary Es in all 4 quadrants and D in the maxillary left quadrant.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Moderately high occlusal plane angle.
Masticatory dysfunction.
Hypertrophied turbinates.
Nasal airway obstruction. Chronic allergies.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
Surgery stage I.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral partial turbinectomies. Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery stage II.
Maxillary osteotomies to down graft the posterior aspect. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible.
Augmentation genioplasty. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B388  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Birth: 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have some arthritic changes associated with it. There may be some loss of vertical dimension. The superior surface of the condyle is not well-defined. It appears there is some discal tissue displaced medially. Difficult to assess joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There may be articular disc tissue anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has moderately good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased joint space but really difficult to tell. Difficult to identify the superior surface of the condyle. There appears to be decreased joint space particularly medially. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount. There may be discal tissue anteriorly placed.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with some flattening and some irregularity in the surface of the condyle on the anterior aspect of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep and fairly long in length. Joint space is fairly well balanced around the condyle but the articular disc is anteriorly displaced and foreshortened in an anteroposterior dimension. This sits almost beneath the articular eminence. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, it appears that the disc may partially reduce and there is moderate translation of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with flattening on the anterior head and again some areas where the cortical bone is difficult to identify as being completely intact. Articular eminence is moderately steep and fairly long. There is some anterior beaking of the condyle present. Some peaking of the condyle is present as well. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. The disc is better seen out laterally than it is over-medially. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is better translation on this side and the disc does reduce in the open views.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with perhaps partial reduction. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation but with reduction.
