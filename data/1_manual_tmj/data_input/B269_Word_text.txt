B269 
B269 is 46 years old, referred by Dr. __. B269 has had previous surgery which include 19 years ago she had a herniated discs at L4 and L5 repaired. Earlier this year she had a hammertoe surgery on the right foot. By history, B269's problems began about 4-1/2 weeks ago of unknown etiology. However, about a year ago she and her husband were hiking and they were carrying something heavy and they slipped and fell and he accidentally kicked her in the jaw area. Her jaw was a little bit stiff and sore for about 3 days and then that dissipated and she had no further problem until this recent episode. Initially she went to an emergency-type room and they placed her on some antibiotics and muscle relaxant (Norflex.) She then developed some high blood pressure and was placed in the hospital for about 4 days because her jaws kept closing down to where she could not get her medications in and had significant difficulty eating and chewing. Her muscles would go into a spasm. Finally, she was injected with some local anesthesia into the masseter muscles on the anterior edge and this helped relieve her. The injections were done just on the right side. B269 believes that most of her problems are on the right side as best as she can tell. Following the injections of the right masseter muscle, she feels as though she is locked in her TMJs. She is currently taking Norflex 100 mg b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg q.d.

PRIMARY CONCERNS
Severe limitation of jaw function.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Stiffness in the jaws.
She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her at this time. She has hayfever and did have an adverse reaction to Benadryl recently, but no other known food or medication allergies. She is not aware of any problems with jewelry either. Chewing does cause stiffness and discomfort in her jaws. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She has lost 10 pounds in the last 4-1/2 weeks. She really has no problems with headaches. She is not aware of having any specific TMJ pain. She does get discomfort in her jaw muscles mainly on the right side at a level of 4. She feels it could possibly go up in the joint, but she cannot differentiate between joint discomfort and the muscle discomfort. Therefore, she may have TMJ discomfort to a level of 4. She rates her jaw function, diet and disability all at 7.

In frontal view, B269 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. In profile, B269 has good facial balance and symmetry. Intraorally, B269 has missing mandibular first bicuspids. She has all of her upper teeth back through the second molars. She had a division II malocclusion. She has Class II end-on cuspid relationship and an anterior deep bite probably of 7 or 8 mm. Maximal incisal opening is 22 mm counting the vertical overbite. There appears to be overjet of 3 to 4 mm in each direction. With a little digital help, B269 was able to go to the right about 9 mm and to the left about 6 mm. I was able to get her up by getting her to relax to almost 30 mm. During that relaxing, trying to stretch episode, she had significant tightness and soreness on the right side over the masseter muscle more so than in the joint itself.

With the ability to go 9 mm to the right and 6 mm to the left, there is definitely not an ankylosis in the joint and it appears that her problems are more muscle related, although the muscle problems could be stimulated from the TMJ pathology.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows that B269 actually had her bilateral mandibular second bicuspid extracted. She has the rest of her teeth back through the third molars present. In the upper arch, she is missing third molars. Apparently, the lower second bicuspids were congenitally missing. Sinuses look clear. The condyles actually look relatively normal as best as can be seen in that particular view.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good shape. Articular eminence is relatively steep. Joint space looks reasonably good. Styloid process is slightly elongated, but not real significant.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears appropriate in size for the fossa. There may be a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. There is joint space all the way around that could be slightly decreased perhaps. On one of the tomograms, there appears to be a section of bone that comes out and overlaps the condyle and seems to extrude from around the external meatus area. On the right tomogram there does appear to be some heterotopic bone overlapping the posterior aspect of the condylar head extruding from the posterior fossa area. Styloid process also has a slightly elongated ligament as best as I can see on the tomogram. B269 has no problems, however, in all movements of the neck in both flexion and extension as well as rotation and tipping. She has no difficulties swallowing and has no pain down through the neck or throat area.

Waters view shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size and it appears that it is probably an adequate airway.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has some slight AP mandibular deficiency and a little bit of a high occlusal plane angle. She has an anterior deep bite of only about 8 mm. Upper incisors are in a division II position and have a decreased axial angulation. Oropharyngeal airway looks adequate.

I gave B269 a prescription for Klonopin 1 mg tablet dispending 10 tablets 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x2. I also gave her a prescription for a CT scan of the bilateral TMJs, ears and temple bone area to include axial views, coronal views and sagittal views.

BASIC DIAGNOSES Severe limited jaw opening.
Right masseter muscle myositis and dyskinesia.
Calcified mass, right TMJ/ear/temple area.
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc disloction.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT
CT scan of TMJs, temple and ear area.
Klonopin 1 mg tablet q.h.s. to see if this will decrease muscle dysfunction.
Presurgical Orthodontics.

Align and level the maxillary arch.
Align and level the mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Consider removal of calcified mass around the right TMJ, ear and temple area if CT scan proves abnormal enlargement and impingement. Consider possible articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors if direct examination shows disc displacement.

B269  MRI Evaluation
Age: 46-year-old female.
Date of acquisition: 
Date of interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has very good mediolateral width. Cortex appears to be intact across the head of the condyle. Fossa appears to be intact. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. It is difficult to identify the discal tissues. Joint space appears to be decreased.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit more narrow than the opposite side, but not too much. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a little greater amount than the opposite side. Joint space appears to be decreased at the lateral rim of the fossa. Cortical bone structures appear to be intact. Disc may be medially displaced. There appears to be heterotopic bone overlying the right joint including coming down below the head of the condyle, down the neck and up above the arch.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some superior peaking of the condyle and decreased superior and joint space particularly at the lateral margin of the fossa. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular is in the vertical orientation probably functioning as a wedge displaced in the condyle posteriorly. There is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle particularly involving he osteophyte sticking out along the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the disc is more difficult to identify. It is possible that this disc may be laterally displaced although reviewing the coronal views again, there possibly could be lateral displacement of the disc. On the open views, there is very restricted translation of the condyle and discs. Condyle may come forward a couple of mm. There may be some inflammation around the joint, but not a real significant. No fluid seen in the joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes associated with it. There is some flattening on the posterior head and there is actually an osteophyte sticking out from the posterior head of the condyle in one area. There is some anterior beaking present on the head of the condyle as well. Also, there is some peaking on the top part of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is vertically oriented and anteriorly displaced more so towards the medial side of the joint as compared to the lateral. There is a little bit of sclerosis on the top of the condyle. On opening, there is virtually no translation of the condyle, though the disc does appear to be in position in some of the views on opening. Decreased translation could possibly mean adhesions within the joint spaces. Need to correlate this to clinical evaluation. There does not appear to be any significant inflammatory process around the joint.

IMPRESSION Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated anteriorly and perhaps laterally with minimal translation of the condyle and disc.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced in a vertical orientation with minimal translation.
Discs appear salvageable depending on correlation of jaw function with the clinical evaluation. Possible heterotopic bone formation over the right TMJ.

B269 CT 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes associated with it. The cortical bone is intact across the head of the condyle. Decreased superior and medial joint spaces. Cortical bone in the fossa appears to be intact with some relatively minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa, but decreased joint space there as well.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit more arthritic. The superior surface has some slight irregularity, but not much. Decreased superior and medial joint spaces. In both joints, the medial wall of the fossa seems to curve inferiorly quite significantly.

3D assessment shows from a posterior view, that the styloid processes are moderately long being greater on the left side than the right side. Condyles appear to have a good width.

Left TMJ lateral view shows moderately long styloid processes. The condyle appears to have reasonable morphology, but the joint space looks narrowed superiorly, but this is probably not the best to determine joint space. The condyle appears to be sitting forward slightly in the fossa. The view of the left TMJ shows the condyle has good mediolateral width.

Right TMJ basically likewise shows good width of the condyle. The right joint appears to have fairly good morphology, but there seems to be limited joint space. But again, this may not be the best view to evaluate joint space.

In the coronal view, the styloid processes look longer than normal.
IMPRESSION: Arthritic changes in the joint. Most notable is decreased joint space, lateral, superior and medially.

B269 Brain MRI 
BRAIN MRI ALSO INCLUDES THE TMJ (PROBABLY RIGHT JOINT)
First sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis on top. It appear to be a little bit postured forward in the fossa. The fossa has a little bit of a different kind of shape to it with a little downward depression in the mid part of the fossa area. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Disc appears to be vertically oriented within the joint. It may be acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posterior into the bilaminar tissue. It is in a displaced position, but in a preclick position. Out laterally, this is harder to visualize.

Left TMJ shows a little bit more arthritic change compared to the opposite side. Disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence as best as I can see. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space in some views toward the medial side. There is anterior beaking present on this condyle. Laterally, the disc is not as readily seen. The joint space appears to be decreased vertically.

Left TMJ coronal view shows decreased joint space medially. There appears to be some arthritic changes on the head of the condyle. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears discal tissue may be anteriorly displaced. I really cannot identify discal tissue in the fossa area. Significantly decreased medial joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit better in morphology. Decreased medial joint space and lateral joint space. I cannot see the disc in these views. There is some medial displacement of the disc towards the anterior aspect of the joint.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and anteriorly displaced articular disc that could be creating a closed lock based on clinical assessment.
Right TMJ anterior displaced disc with a vertical orientation.
