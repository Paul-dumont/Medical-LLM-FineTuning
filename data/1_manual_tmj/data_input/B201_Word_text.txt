B201
B201 is 52 years old and is a self-referral. B201 became aware of joint problems and pain about 2 weeks ago. So far she has had no treatment. The incident began when she was brushing her teeth and developed some severe pain in her right jaw joint. She has had no treatment so far except she is on ibuprofen 600 mg p.r.n. pain and Skelaxin 800 mg 2 times per day. In addition, she takes Aciphex 20 mg per day and Cozaar 100 mg q.d. B201 gets headaches daily in the frontal, temporal, and occasionally in the back of the head at a level of 7. Her daily TMJ pain reaches a level of 8, average daily pain is at 6, jaw function at 8, diet at 8, disability at 6. She has no earaches but has constant tinnitus and occasional vertigo. She probably has some hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She does have a history of high blood pressure. She is aware of clenching her teeth at nighttime and also during the day.

On frontal view, B201 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 0. Maxillary midline is just a touch to the left about 2 mm. The right eye is about 2 mm higher than the left. The mandibular dental midline is about 3 mm to the left. The chin is fairly close to being on the facial midline. In profile, B201 has fairly good facial symmetry. The chin is a little bit AP deficient. Chin neckline is short and chin neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B201 is missing the mandibular right second bicuspid and all third molars. On the left side, she likewise is missing second bicuspid and all three molars. She has significant lower arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being about almost 4 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, she is missing the right second bicuspid and has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. She also in the upper arch is missing the two central incisors and right lateral incisor, but she has had two implants placed and a 3-unit bridge placed in the area. She has a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side and almost a full Class II cuspid on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 to 4 mm. The lower anterior teeth have a transverse axial inclination where the roots are displaced towards the right and crowns towards the left. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Fascial pillars are mild to moderately constricted. Intranasal structures look relatively normal. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseter muscles, right TMJ, and milder tenderness over the left TMJ, right retromolar area, and right SCM. The maximum incisal opening is 28 mm, opening without pain 21 mm. Excursion movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 4 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows that absence of the mandibular second bicuspids through the molars bilaterally. In the upper arch, she is missing the right second bicuspid and bilateral third molars. She has an osteointegrated implant in the left central incisor area and right lateral incisor area with a pontic replacing the right incisor. Sinuses look relatively clear. She has a prominence of the styloid processes, particularly on the right side. Coronal radiograph shows that she does have a hypertrophied right turbinate more towards the posterior aspect and it appears the sinuses appear clear.

Axial view shows that the septum appears relatively straight and sinuses are clear. Right turbinate is moderately enlarged, particularly at the posterior aspect of it.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with arthritis. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. Condyle appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa more towards the lateral aspect of the joint. There is also an increased joint space towards the lateral aspect.

Right TMJ appears to have a little bit more arthritic changes with some definite anterior beaking and sclerosis on the head of the condyle. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The joint appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. There is increased anterior joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased lateral joint space.
Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that may a little bit more arthritic. There is decreased joint space.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is over angulation of the lower incisors and the upper incisors to a degree. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures about 9 mm and at the base of the tongue measures about 5 mm. The tongue is held low in the mouth with a space of about 8 mm between the level of the palate and the dorsum of the tongue.

Basic diagnoses for B201 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction on the left side and closed lock on the right side with adhesions of the disc to the articular eminence.
TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain.
Headaches. Missing bilaterally the second bicuspids through third molars, in the upper arch missing the right second bicuspid and bilateral third molars. Class I cuspid on the right side, Class II cuspid on the left side. Significant mandibular arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being about 4 mm posterior to the right cuspid.
Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). c.	Application of arch bars.
B201 MRI

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There appears to be discal tissue medial and anterior to the condyle. The fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. There is decreased vertical joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is arthritic. There are some depressions and elevations in the contour and the condyle appears to have decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm. There is discal tissue that appears to be medially displaced. The joint space is decreased at the lateral aspect of the joint.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology with some anterior beaking present, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. Out laterally, the disc is not really visible but it appears to come into view almost at the medial aspect of the condyle. The disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is some restricted translation. However, it appears that the disc goes back into position, although it is significantly deformed.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic with some anterior beaking and sclerosis in the top. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The disc is displaced laterally and not seen very well towards the medial aspect of the joint. This disc has a little better morphology than the opposite side. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. The right TMJ appears to have restricted translation and the disc appears to remain anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reduction on the left side and non-reducing on the right side.
