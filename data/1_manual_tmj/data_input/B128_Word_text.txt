B128
B128 is 22 years old, referred by XXXX.
PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Bites the inside of the cheeks.
Facial imbalance. Predominately mouth breather particularly when sleeping.

In frontal view, B128 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 0. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline or maybe just about 1 mm to the left. Maxillary mandibular dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The maxillary midline is about 1 mm to the left. Chin is fairly well aligned on the facial midline. The right side of the mandible appears to be elongated by probably about 3 or 4 mm. In profile view he has some sallowness in the infraorbital area. Perhaps some slight AP maxillary deficiency but not too significant. Chin actually appears a little bit retruded but lower lip is prominent and everted. Chin is retruded about 4 or 5 mm. Chin-neckline may be a little bit short and chin-neck angle has a soft curvature to it. Intraorally, B128 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. The teeth appear to be fairly well aligned and leveled. In the upper arch he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has an accentuated curve of Wilson in the upper jaw. He has a full Class III cuspid molar relationship bilaterally. In fact, just a little bit of a super Class III on the left side. He has an open bite of about 2 mm. Anterior 8 to 9 teeth in the mandible are completely out of occlusion. Transversely, the occlusal plane appears relatively level in the maxilla but the mandible may be down about 1 mm on the right side. Nasal tip appears to be deviated off to the right side about 2 mm. On evaluation it appears that the maxillary midline may be on the facial midline and it may be the mandible that is a little bit off to the right side in both the dental midline and chin. He does have an anterior crossbite with reverse overjet of about 8 or 9 mm. Maxilla has been expanded posteriorly so that the molar area there is not a crossbite. Intranasally, the septum appears deviated a little bit off towards the right side. The right turbinate appears moderately enlarged and may be encroaching on the airway a little bit. The left turbinate appears more normal in size and it appears that there may be an adequate airway on that side. B128 has quite large tonsils but states he does not have problems with sore throats or tonsillitis. The nasoseptum is deviated a little bit off to the right side and the right turbinate is moderately enlarged, left one is relatively normal. Columella is a little bit wide. No history of snoring, daytime somnolence or sleep apnea. To palpation, B128 has no tenderness around the head and neck area. He definitely has audible clicking and popping in the left TMJ at about 20 mm of opening and 15 mm of closing. The right side seems relatively smooth except B128 states that it does click and pop at times. B128 rates his TMJ pain at 0, headaches at 0, pain around the head and neck area at 0, jaw function at 1, diet at 0, disability at 4. B128 has had orthodontic appliances on for about a year and 9 months and he has had some maxillary expansion. When B128 was about 13 or 14 years of age, his bite was much better aligned than it currently is. When he went through his pubertal growth spurt, the lower jaw did grow excessively then he felt it sort of stabilized before he began the orthodontic treatment. The orthodontics has made the bite worse. B128 had his wisdom teeth removed over the Christmas holiday.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars but all the rest of the teeth are present. The left sinus appears a little bit more cloudy than the right sinus. Condylar heads and necks appear elongated.

Waters view shows that he has a significant deviation of the nasal septum with a large spur back in the bony part of the septum extending into the right side of the nose. On the left side he has a large bony spur also extending out in the left side of the nose blocking off the majority of the airway there. Right turbinate is extremely large as are the middle turbinates particularly on the right side. There is a little bit of cloudiness in the left maxillary sinus but the other sinuses all appear clear.

Tomographic evaluation of the right TMJ shows a condyle head and neck that is quite elongated. Articular eminence is moderate inclination. There appears there may be adequate joint space although the joint space is narrow indicative of either disc displacement or a thin disc.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have some mild changes on the top. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence appears a little bit more shallow on this side than the opposite side. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalogram shows that B128 has a high occlusal plane angle with an anterior open bite. There is a skeletal Class III relationship but a greater Class III occlusal relationship. Chin appears weak. Oropharyngeal airway is about 6 mm at the soft palate level and about 13 mm at the base of the tongue. Dental model analysis shows that B128 has small upper lateral incisors creating about a 3 mm or more tooth size discrepancy. In the Class I position, the maxilla is excessively wide compared to the width of the mandible and he actually goes into a total buccal crossbite with the first and second molars. The teeth are distorted on the model so tooth size analysis cannot be performed. Transverse width of the lower arch appears somewhat narrow.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral condylar hyperplasia (probably arrested but further evaluation is required.)
Left TMJ articular disc dislocation with reduction. AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
Transverse maxillary excess. Mandibular prognathism.
Anterior open bite.
Class III occlusion. Deviated nasal septum with septal spurring to both the left and right sides.
Hypertrophied turbinate on the right side. Nasal airway obstruction.
Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 2 to 3 mm.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
MRI of left and right TMJ. Presurgical orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. It would actually be helpful to let the upper jaw shift back into a posterior crossbite relation because in the Class I position the maxilla is excessively wide (however, this can be addressed surgically as well.)
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm or perhaps 3 mm of tooth structure to help correct for the tooth size discrepancy.
Surgery.
Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, decrease the occlusal plane angle and transversely narrow the maxilla.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to counterclockwise rotate the mandible into proper occlusal position. Nasoseptoplasty.
Partial right turbinectomy. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
