B281 is 20 years old, referred by Dr. __. B281 has stomach and intestinal infection that is ongoing that has been there since high school. She takes medications to keep it under control. She had surgery to repair a broken right arm 11 years ago. She currently takes Nystatin 4 tablets once daily and thyroid (Armour) 180 mg daily. She has had an adverse reaction to codeine. The codeine makes her sick and that gives her a rash.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Pain through the jaw and face area.
Pain down through the neck and back.
Cannot chew.
Limited jaw function.
Noises in the joints.
Facial swelling.
Locking of the jaw where she opens a small amount but then cannot close her jaws.

She gets frequent earaches but no tinnitus and sometimes gets vertigo but no hearing loss. She has no other joint problems. She is aware of clenching of her teeth at night and also she catches herself doing this during the daytime. She gets headaches at a level of 8 in the frontal, temple and posterior head area bilaterally. Her pain is worse in the mornings. She rates her TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at 6 to 7, jaw function and diet at 7 and disability at 7.

In frontal view B281 has good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. Maxillary, mandibular and chin midlines are all pretty much aligned on the facial midline. In profile view, B281 has some fairly good facial symmetry. Chin may be just a little bit retruded perhaps maybe 5 mm. Intraorally, B281 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. A little bit of crowding in the lower anterior arch. Apparently her teeth were much straighter and have gotten a little bit crowded since all this began. In the upper arch, B281 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. The oropharyngeal areas look healthy with the uvula, soft palpate and faucial pillars all relatively normal. Her tonsils are present. Intranasally, the septum is deviated off towards the left side some. The turbinates are fairly large in size. The left one seems to be more obstructed than the right side although the right turbinate is larger. B281 states that she does not sleep well at night and gets up about every two hours and this is mainly related to her pain problems. She had no trouble sleeping prior to this injury. Prior to the injury, B281 was unaware of any noises in her jaw joints. To palpation, she has some high moderate to low severe pain in the masseters and TMJs, high moderate pain in the temporalis and posterior neck, moderate pain in the medial pterygoids, SCMs, shoulder areas and milder tenderness in the styloid areas. On opening, the lower jaw deviates to the left side about 4 mm. Maximal opening is 38 mm with only about 20 to 25 mm without significant pain or discomfort. Excursive movement to the right was only about 2 to 3 mm and to the left side was 7 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. Difficult to tell but the sinuses look reasonably clear. Condyle on the right side appears a little bit flattened in the front. On the left side it looks more reasonably good.

Waters view shows that the bony septum is nice and straight. The turbinates are enlarged and fill up most of the nasal cavity. The sinuses appear relatively clear.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking perhaps and a little bit of sclerosis on top of the condyle. Superior and posterior joint spaces are decreased. Articular eminence has some moderate steepness. It could be a little pseudocyst in the condylar head.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology. Decreased posterior joint space and perhaps a little bit in the superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There could be a little pseudocyst in the head of the condyle as well. On opening, there is better translation in the left joint than the right side. The right side shows significant decreased translatory movements. The left side shows some translation but the condyle falls short of the apex of the articular eminence.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows skeletal Class I jaw relationship. Incisors are slightly over-angulated and both arches appear harmonious. Chin is a little AP deficient. Oropharyngeal airway looks very good with relative normal limits.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction on the left side.
Relative mandibular hyperplasia. TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain. Headaches.
Masticatory dysfunction.
Nocturnal and daytime clenching.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications. Klonopin 1 mg tablet q.h.s.
Lortab 7.5 mg 1 tablet q.4-6h. p.r.n. Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch.
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies with bone screw stabilization. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

I gave B281 2 prescriptions today: 1. Klonopin 1 mg tablets dispensing 30 tablets 1 tablet q.h.s, refill x5. 2. Lortab 7.5 mg tablets dispensing 30 tablets 1 tablet q.4-6h. p.r.n. pain, refill x5.

She has tried Advil with Tylenol and Darvocet. Darvocet only last for about an hour for her and then the pain is quite severe again. I believe that the medications that I prescribed for her should help her situation.

B281  MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is some anterior beaking present. The disc is anteriorly displaced sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is foreshortened anteroposteriorly and thickened. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is some anterior beaking present. The joint space actually looks reasonably good though this could be related to longterm splint therapy.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Decreased posterior joint space. The disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence but in much better shape than the opposite side. The disc has reasonably good morphology and probably reduces early. Out laterally, it appears it is a little bit more thickened and a little bit more deformed and not as significant as the opposite side. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that fairly good morphology. Decreased vertical dimension. Views are rather dark and are difficult to identify discal structure.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit smaller than the opposite side. It appears there may be loss of vertical dimension. The cortical bone appears intact. There may be some discal tissue over-medial to the condyle. The joint space is somewhat decreased but not as significant as the opposite side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 2 to 3 mm. It is difficult to identify discal tissue on this side.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation being worse on the left side than the right side with greater articular disc deformation on the left side.
