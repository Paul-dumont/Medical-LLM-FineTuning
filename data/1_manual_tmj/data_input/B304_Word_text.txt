B304 
B304 is 48 years old and is referred by. B304 has had a previous tonsillectomy, three laparoscopies, previous hand surgery and she has had rib resections for vascular problems.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS: Lipitor 10 mg.
Nortriptyline 30 mg q.h.s.
Tylenol, Advil and occasionally Excedrin for her headaches.
B304 has had headaches all of her life as long as she can remember. She had a fall when she was seven years old and hit the back of her head. She has had headaches at least since that time. Seven years ago, a truck hit the car that she was driving and she hit the left side of her face. She did have a concussion in that accident.

She had orthodontic treatment including headgear as a teenager. Her pain had gotten more intense. She saw Dr. __, who placed her in an orthotic appliance which she continues to use. She also started physical therapy treatments initially three times a week. She now goes in one to three times a week depending on the necessity.

She gets earaches that are severe on the right side but no tinnitus. She gets vertigo but has no hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her neck where she has a herniated disc and a bulging disc in her neck. She also has some problems of the right shoulder and does need some chiropractic treatment on that occasionally. No other joints bother her. She does clench and brux at nighttime and during the day she is aware of clenching.

B304 gets daily headaches at a level of 9 predominately in the temporal and posterior head area and occurs more frequently on the right side than the left side. Overall, her pain is worse on the right side than the left side. She rates her TMJ pain at 9, average daily pain at 9, jaw function at 9, diet at 5, disability at 5. B304 wore the orthotic for quite some time and it did help her some but then her pain problems got significantly worse again. She had not seen Dr. __ in some time and went back to see him this year and he made a new splint for her but this has not really improved her situation. B304 had an done on as ordered by Dr. __. The films are not available so I cannot interpret them myself but the impression was that there was gross anterior displacement of the articular discs with failure to recapture and moderate to large joint effusion. On the left side, there is anterior displacement of the articular disc without recapture.

In frontal view, B304 has fairly good symmetry to middle and upper third face. She has some slight orbital dystopia with the right eye being about 2 to 3 mm higher than the left eye. Maxillary midline is pretty well aligned with the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm off to the left side but it is fairly well aligned with the chin. The chin is off to the left side probably about 3 or 4 mm. Upper lip length is 20 mm.

B304 
Tooth-to-lip relationship is 1 mm. In profile view, B304 has some slight AP maxillary deficiency maybe a couple of mm. Chin appears to be retruded about 10 or 12 mm. Chin-neckline and angle are not well defined. Intraorally, she is missing mandibular right first molar replaced by a bridge. She has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. She has good attached gingiva in the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side. Class II end-on cuspid relationship being about almost 5 mm Class II on the left side. She does have about a 2 mm anterior overbite relationship. Transverse cant is present in the occlusion with the left cuspid being about at least 2 mm higher than the right side. Uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars appear to be relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum is deviated significantly off towards the right side. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. It appears there is moderate nasal airway obstruction. B304 has had a sleep study done and will send the report later. In the lower arch, the left cuspid is about 1 to 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. The upper arch appears fairly symmetric anteroposteriorly. To palpation, B304 has some moderate discomfort over the temporalis muscles, right masseter, very high moderate pain over the right TMJ and mild tenderness over the right medial pterygoid and the styloid areas bilaterally. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is 31 mm, 17 mm without discomfort. Interestingly, excursive movements are about 8 mm in each direction. Joints seem to function smoothly and B304 reports no noises with jaw function in her joints. B304 does have a CPAP machine. However, she does not tolerate it well and has significant difficulties wearing the device.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presence of impacted mandibular left third molar but the other third molars are absent. The mandibular right first molar is absent but replaced with a 3-unit bridge. She has a root canal on the right second molar. Pulp chambers in the canals are difficult to identify particularly in the molar teeth. The left sinus looks a little bit cloudy compared to the right side. The condyles appear arthritic with the left side actually looking worse than the right side.

Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Bony nasal septum is straight indicative of the deviation primarily in the cartilaginous portion of the septum. Right turbinate appears quite large. Facial asymmetry is noted. Slight difference in orbital heights can be noted as well.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic with some flattening on the anterior head. There is actually increased superior and posterior joint space and decreased anterior joint space. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has some anterior beaking and some flattening on the superior head. Joint space may be better balanced. Articular eminence has some moderate inclination. On opening, there is restricted translation of both condyles with them coming down towards the articular eminence but not beyond.

B304 
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a slight skeletal Class II occlusal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway dimension at the base of the tongue measures about 6 mm and soft palate level closer to 8 mm. B304 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm. Unilateral thickness of the crowns may indicate even a greater discrepancy probably estimated 4 mm. B304 does remember that her jaw joints did click and pop before she got her first appliance. It was after that when the disc stopped clicking and popping.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. AP mandibular deficiency.
Facial asymmetry with the left side of her face being shorter than the right side.
Transverse cant in the occlusion with the left side being 2 to 3 mm shorter vertically than the right side.
Class I occlusion on the right side.
Almost a full Class II occlusion on the left side. Severe TMJ pain. Severe headaches. Myofascial pain. Masticatory dysfunction. Deviated nasal septum. Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Sleep apnea syndrome. Tooth size discrepancy (estimated 4 mm.)

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
Medications.
a. Klonopin to control nocturnal clenching and bruxism. Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch. Open up 1 mm space around each upper lateral incisor. Tip the lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally and make room for interdental osteotomy. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing no more than 1 or 2 mm of tooth structure to help compensate for the significant tooth size discrepancy. Presurgical orthodontics.
CT scans of TMJs and jaws (TMJ Concepts protocol.)

B304 
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction and level transversely.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts.
Bilateral mandibular coronoidectomies.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
Nasal septoplasty.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

Evaluation Age: 48/F
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite flattened and it appears to have lost vertical dimension. Some sclerosis in the cortical bone on top of the condyle. Decreased vertical joint space. Fairly significant downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa probably 3 to 4 mm. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better architecture with less loss of vertical bone. There appears to be sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves significantly inferiorly. Joint space is decreased but not as much as the opposite side and more so at the lateral rim of the fossa area. The disc is anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with a little bit of flattening on the anterior aspect with maybe just some slight anterior beaking. There may be a little superior peaking in the condyle and in some views towards the lateral side of the joint. Decreased superior and posterior joint space is present. Particularly at the medial side of the joint and then towards the lateral side of the joint there is loss of vertical space. Articular disc is sitting anterior to the articular eminence. It is quite short anteroposteriorly in some of the views and it appears quite deformed and distorted. It appears that it has some medial displacement as well. In some of the views it is rather difficult to identify the tissue. However, it is significantly degenerated. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle and the disc remains anteriorly dislocated. The disc appears to be adhesed to the articular eminence as there is virtually no movement forward. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not too significant.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening. A little osteophyte is sticking off the superior aspect. A little bit of anterior beaking may be present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence but actually angled quite inferiorly beneath the articular eminence. This is foreshortened and deformed, thickened but not as severely degenerated as the opposite side. On opening, there is restricted translation although slightly better than the opposite side. The disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. In one view it does appear that there could be an osteophytic projection that could almost touch against the fossa. This is towards the lateral aspect of the joint. The disc does seem to have some ability to translate.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ significant arthritis and articular disc dislocation with major deformation non-reducing and probably adhesions to the articular eminence. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and significant degeneration.
Right disc could possibly be salvaged. The left disc appears non-salvageable.
