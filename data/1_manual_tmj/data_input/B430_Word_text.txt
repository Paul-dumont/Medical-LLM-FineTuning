B430 
B430 is 29 and two minutes older than her identical twin sister.
Patient History
B430's problems began about four years ago of unknown etiology. She originally thought it was all sinus related problems. An ENT doctor did tell her that he thought it was TMJ. It wasn't until more recently that it became more evident to her that it was, in fact, a TMJ problem. She did try a splint about four years ago. She currently is undergoing significant physical therapy for myofascial release treatments.

Other joints that bother her include her neck, back, hips, knees, and feet. She gets earaches with sharp pains in the ears, and she gets occasional tinnitus and vertigo, and she has a feeling of fullness in her ears.

She is allergic to SULFA, MEDROL, REGLAN, and she does have problems with cheaper jewelry.
Her mother has severe TMJ and migraine problems.
B430 drinks about one Coke per day, has daily chocolate but a small amount, and she does not take any significant milk foods except for some cheese.

Patient Concerns
Basic concerns B430 has include the following:
Severe TMJ pain.
Severe headaches.
Severe pain through the muscles around the head and neck area.
Pain on eating and chewing.
Pain down from the neck into the shoulders and into the back.
Significant GI problems.

Current Medications
She takes the following medications:
Zoloft 100 mg q.h.s.
Trazodone 50 mg q.h.s.
Ultracet 100 mg.
Fiorinal.
Clomid 50 mg q.d.
Multivitamins.
Calcium 1000 mg q.d.
Clinical Evaluation

Upper lip length is 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1.5 mm. Maxillary dental midline is shifted just a little bit off to the right side.

In profile view, she has some slight AP maxillary deficiency and some AP mandibular deficiency. Chin neckline is a little bit short, and chin-neck angle is not really well defined.

Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. She has some mild crowding, lower anterior teeth. She has some mild stripping around the lower anterior teeth, particularly the central incisors and high attached labial frenulum. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some moderate crowding. She has a slight Class II end-on occlusal relationship on the right side and Class I on the left side. She has an anterior overbite of about 3 mm. Transversely, she has a little asymmetry with the left cuspid being about 1 mm lower than the right side. Intraorally, oropharynx appears clear. Soft palate appears relatively normal as does the uvula. There appears to be good distance between the soft palate and posterior pharyngeal wall area. Tongue may be slightly large.

Intranasally, the septum is deviated off toward the left side anteriorly causing significant narrowing of the nostril on that side. More posteriorly, however, it appears to be deviated off toward the right side. Opening up the nostrils significantly improved her ability to breathe through her nose.

To palpation, she has some moderate pain over the temporalis muscles, some high moderate pain over the masseters, and severe pain over the rest of the head and neck area. Maximal incisor opening is 38 mm but without significant pain only 27. Excursive movements are 6 mm in each direction, but there is some crepitus in both joints with the left side being worse than the right side.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. Sinuses appear a little bit cloudy. Nasal airway on the left side appears decreased compared to the right side. Condyles appear to have a little of anterior beaking and flattening of the anterior head of the condyles. There could be a little loosened area beneath the incisors. It is difficult to tell on these x-rays.

Waters view actually shows the sinuses are relatively clear. Turbinate on the right side appears a little bit large.
Left TMJ tomogram shows that the teeth weren't together, so she may not have been biting all the way. It shows a decreased posterior and superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep and quite long. Increased anterior joint space indicative of probably a vertical orientation of the articular disc and anterior displacement.

Right TMJ tomogram reveals teeth are apart with increased joint space. Will need to repeat that. Opening shows there is restricted translation.
Cephalometrically reveals a skeletal Class II relationship. Oropharyngeal airway is somewhat narrow opening of about 4 mm. Tongue fills most of the oral cavity.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations.
AP maxillary and mandibular deficiency (probably not worth treating at this time).
Severe headaches.
Severe TMJ pain.
Severe myofascial pain.
Probable fibromyalgia.
Nasal septum deviated off toward the left side.
Wide columella base with constricture of the nostrils.
Moderate hypertrophied turbinates.
Multiple joint problems including neck, back, hips, knees, and feet.
Slight Class II occlusion on the right side, Class I on the left.
Maxillary dental midline shifted a little bit to the left about 1.5 mm.

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch.
Medications
Doxycycline 100 mg tablets, disp. 60, 1 tablet b.i.d., refill x 3.
Klonopin 1 mg tablet, disp. 30, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x 2.

Perform the following lab tests
Immunodeficiency panel including CD56.
IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgM.
Chlamydia antibody group including psittaci.
HLA-A, B, C, and DR loci.
ANA rheumatoid factor and thyroid profile.

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies with bone screw stabilization.
Consider possible eminectomies.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
Physical therapy if necessary to re-establish good jaw function
B430 could possibly be done without orthodontics, although it will leave her in a Class II end-on occlusion on the right side, but her occlusion would remain pretty much as it is. She would get a more ideal result of the arches were aligned and leveled appropriately.

B430 MRI Evaluation 
Date of MRI:  
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears somewhat narrow mediolaterally. The condyle may be narrow anteroposteriorly because the condyle is seen in three different views, and the medial pole must be rotated posteriorly fairly significantly. It appears the cortical bone is intact as best as can be ascertained from these views. Significantly decreased lateral joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves downward fairly significantly. There may be some medial displacement of the articular disc.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width and joint space over medially. The lateral rim of the fossa does not have quite as significant downward curvature as the left side. Cortical structures appear to be intact. Disc may be anteriorly displaced. Slightly decreased joint space out laterally.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is somewhat narrow. Decreased posterior joint space. The disc appears anteriorly displaced. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Out laterally, the disc is in a vertical orientation and perhaps a little bit more displaced than it is toward the medial aspect. Condyle also is much wider out laterally as compared to medially. A little bit of fluid is present in the superior joint space.

On opening, there is some restricted translation, although the condyle appears to reduce over the disc. There is some slight anterior beaking of the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposteriorly. A little sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence is quite steep on this side, and, in fact, steeper than the opposite side. Articular disc is vertically oriented and anteriorly displaced but is a little bit better position medially as compared to laterally. There is fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. Condyle does appear to have some deformation to it. On one view, it appears that there is some loss of cortex on the anterior aspect of the condylar head.

On opening, there is slightly better translation than the opposite side, and the disc appears to reduce. Changes in the condylar head morphology are better appreciated in the open views.

Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation in a vertical orientation with reduction but somewhat limited translation.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
