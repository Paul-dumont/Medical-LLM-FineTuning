B363 
B363  is 30 years old. Her primary concerns are as follows:
Chin is recessed.
Difficulties breathing in deeply.
Tired during the day and can fall asleep at almost any time.
Low energy at times.
Anxiety.
Problems with concentration, forgetfulness.

B363 takes the following medications:
Synthroid 125 mcg 1 per day.
Lexapro 10 mg 1 per day. Allegra 180 mg as needed.
Rhinocort nasal spray 32 mcg q.d.
Pulmicort inhaler 180 mcg q.d.
Milk of magnesia as needed.

B363 has previously been diagnosed with Graves disease (hyperthyroidism), anxiety, and allergies. Graves disease was treated with radioactive iodine, and now she is hypothyroid.

vgets headaches about 2 to 3 times per month at a level of 4 predominantly in the frontal and temporal area. She has no identifiable TMJ pain at this time. Average daily pain is at 3, jaw function, diet, and disability are at 0. She is aware of some clicking her jaw joints, but the onset is unknown and the etiology is unknown. She had orthodontics from about the age of 12 to 14 by Dr. __. She has no trouble with earaches, tinnitus, gets occasional vertigo, but no hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching some during the day. She has had a rhinoplasty 14 years ago and then a secondary rhinoplasty last year which also included a septoplasty.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B363 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is zero. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. The right side of the jaw may be slightly longer than the left side by maybe 4-5 mm. In profile view, she has fairly good projection of the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. The chin may be somewhat retruded. Chin neckline may be a little bit short. Chin neck angle is not very well defined. There is just some slight AP maxillary deficiency of 2 mm and the chin appears to be retruded about 8-10 mm. Intraorally, B363 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. Teeth appear to be nicely aligned and leveled. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. Oropharyngeal tissues all look normal and healthy. She has a good Class I cuspid-molar relationship and about a 2 mm vertical overbite. Intranasally, it is hard to see because she has some constricture of the luminal valves. At least anteriorly, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size and the septum appears reasonably straight. Radiographic exam will help delineate the nasal airway.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The rest of the teeth are all present. Sinuses look relatively clear. Coronal view shows that the turbinates appear quite large. The septum appears reasonably straight. Sinuses look clear. Axial view shows that the turbinates are quite large, but sinuses are clear and septum appears reasonably straight. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that oropharyngeal airway appears relatively normal. She has a Class I skeletal and occlusal relationship. Cephalometric analysis demonstrates that the mandible is a little bit retruded compared to the maxilla, although there is a Class I occlusal relationship. Maxillary incisors are a little bit vertical and the mandibular incisors have a relationship normal inclination. Oropharyngeal airway measures 8-10 mm which is within normal range.

Right TMJ tomogram coronal and lateral views show significant arthritic changes in the condyle. There is increased vertical joint space in the center part of the joints, but decreased at the articular eminence area. There is also decreased joint space at the lateral rim of the fossa. This may be indicative of medial disc displacement.

Left TMJ sagittal and coronal views show the condyle does appear arthritic. Joint space appears decreased vertically and also at the lateral aspect of the joint. It is quite possible that she has displaced articular discs.

Basic diagnoses at this time would include the following:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and probable articular disc dislocations. Headaches. Hypertrophied turbinates with probable partial nasal airway obstruction. Daytime somnolence.

Recommended treatment is as follows:
MRI of left and right TMJs.
Reassess patient after MRI data obtained. Consider reduction turbinectomies by ENT specialist.

B363  MRI 
AGE: 30/F
DOB: 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat arthritic. There appears to be some flattening on the superior head. Lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat. There may be some discal tissue medial to the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of an odd shape to it and in one area it is almost like a heart. There appears to be some discal space up in the joint area. There appears to be a medial extension of the condylar head. The lateral rim of the fossa is quite flat.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Discal tissue is degenerated out laterally. More medially, there is very identifiable discal tissue. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint, but at the very medial aspect it is appears to be in better position. Lack of disc at the lateral aspect of the joint may indicate a medial displacement. There may be a little bit of fluid in the joint space, but not too significant. On opening, there appears to be a reduction of the disc, and there is good translation of the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows more advanced degenerative changes in the condyle with a little bit of anterior beaking and seems to show an erosion on the top of the condyle. In some of the views, the condyle looks very unusual. At the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc may be anteriorly displaced, but more medially it appears to be in better position, although the disc may be somewhat degenerated. There is some fluid in the joint spaces. On opening, there is reduction in the disc and good translation of both the condyle and the disc.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and medial and anterior displacement of the articular disc. Right TMJ arthritis (worse than the left side) and articular disc that is anteriorly displaced with early reduction.
