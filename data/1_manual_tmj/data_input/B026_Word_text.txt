B026
B026 is 53 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B026 believes that her TMJ problems may have begun when she was about 23 when she was assaulted and beat around the jaw area. She has been aware of breathing problems since about the age of 9 when she could not keep up with the rest of the kids. She also had a fall as a kid and has a fairly large laceration beneath her chin area. She also fell one other time and knocked her front tooth. She was diagnosed with sleep apnea about 7 years ago, but her kids tell she had severe snoring problems and would wake up gasping for breath quite a few years earlier. She has earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, and hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her back, neck, and right knee. She is aware of clenching at night time and also during the day.

She takes the following medications:
Atacand for blood pressure.
Zocor (cholesterol).
Imitrex for migraines.
During the years that she had splint therapy about 30 years ago and she wore these for several years and did not really have any problems but gave her chocking and gagging problems. She has tried various night guards through the years, but these have not worked either. She has had several occlusal adjustments, physical therapy, chiropractic treatment, and massage therapy without relief. She did have an arthrogram done 30 years ago that did show that she had displaced discs at that time. Apparently, there already were perforations at that time. B026 currently has an APAP that she uses. She has difficulties tolerating the mask and the straps that hold it in place. These devices increase her pain. She is so hypersensitive from the TMJ problems that she has significant difficulties even wearing glasses. A sleep study that she had taken on 6 years and 4 months ago, shows that she has significant sleep apnea problems and would desaturate down to about 84%.

CLINICAL EVALUATION. In frontal view, B026 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is probably -2 mm. The maxillary incisors appear to be pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is shifted off to the right side about 1.5 mm. Chin is off to the right side probably a couple of millimeters as well. The maxilla is retruded by about 6 mm and the mandible is deficient by probably 15 mm. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 3-4 mm. There is no defined chin neckline. Intraorally, she is missing the mandibular left first molar and third molar. On the right side, she is missing the crown on the second bicuspid. There is mild crowding in the lower anterior arch with good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she is missing the right second and third molars. She has an anterior deep bite of about 4-5 mm. She is fairly close to being a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy, but the soft palate appears elongated and the fascial pillars appear to be moderately constricted. The septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. The turbinates are moderate in size. She may have some mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, she has high moderate to low severe pain over the TMJs, retromandibular area, and pretty much moderate pain throughout the rest of the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 36 mm, opening without significant pain about 27 mm. The excursion movements are about 3 mm in each direction and with pain.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars and the maxillary second molars and mandibular left first molar. She has root canals on the maxillary left central, right lateral, right cuspid, right second bicuspid, left first molar and mandibular right first molar. She has a residual root in the second bicuspid area. Sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size, although the bony septum appears reasonably straight. The joints look arthritic.

Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear, but the turbinates particularly on the right side are extremely large and appear to block most of the nasal airway.

Axial view likewise shows that the sinuses are clear and that the right turbinate is quite large. The septum looks reasonably straight.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows severe arthritis in the left TMJ with what appears to be bone-on-bone contact in areas. There is anterior beaking and just significant deformation.

Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that also looks deformed and arthritic, but not as deformed as the opposite side. There is actually decrease joint space more anterior and better joint space superiorly and posteriorly.

Left TMJ coronal view shows what appears to be almost bone-on-bone contact with sclerosis and arthritis including pseudocysts in the head of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 4 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is arthritic with a little osteophyte sticking up in the middle of the condyle. There is decreased joint space, but not as severe as the opposite side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B026 has a retruded maxilla and mandible and a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 6 mm at the soft palate level and about 4 mm at the base of the tongue. B026 also has speech problems as a result of her situation and states that people complain that they cannot understand her.

Basic diagnoses for B026 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis.
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Missing maxillary second and third molars and mandibular left first molar as well as missing the crown on the mandibular right second bicuspid.
Severe TMJ pain.
Severe headaches. Myofascial pain.
Bilateral hypertrophied nasal turbinates.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Dental restorations as necessary to maintain the health of the teeth.
2. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. Maintain spacing around the upper anterior teeth as there is a mild tooth size discrepancy of about 1-2 mm. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
3. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
4. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses with advancement of about 15 mm at pogonion. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction approximately 8 mm at the incisor tip. c.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. d.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). e.	Bilateral coronoidotomies.
5. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
6. Restorative dentistry that may include implants and crown and bridge work to finalize the occlusion.

B026 MRI AGE: 53/F Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears severely arthritic. There is decreased vertical joint space. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is in a little bit better shape than the opposite side. There is a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There appears to be decreased joint space. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite arthritic with sclerosis, anterior beaking, flattening on the posterior head and on the anterior head of the condyle. The articular eminence is fairly steep. There appears to be some degenerative changes in the articular eminence as well. There is significantly decreased vertical and posterior joint space. The articular disc is anterior to the condyle and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there is limited translation and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction and with significant deformation. It appears that there may be bone-on-bone contact in some areas with probable perforation through the bilaminar tissues.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit more hockey stick shape to it with some anterior sclerosis on the head of the condyle and anterior beaking. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is short anteroposteriorly. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is better translation on this side with the condyle coming down almost beneath the articular eminence, but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction with significant degenerative changes.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ advanced arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced, severely degenerated, non-reducing and with degenerative changes on the articular eminence. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction and with significant deformation and non-reducing. Probable indication for bilateral total joint prostheses.
