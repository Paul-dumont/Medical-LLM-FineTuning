B034
B034 is 32 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B034's problems began in eight years ago at the age of 25 of unknown etiology. She began developing clicking and pain in the right side of her head, jaw, and neck area. She saw an orthodontist who felt he could fix the problem. She began orthodontics sometime the following year and the braces were finally taken off in two months ago. She had all four first bicuspids extracted. She had splint therapy beginning one month ago. She has had three splints since that time. Her right joint locked after receiving the splint therapy, and has remained locked since that time. She rates her headaches at 10 on the right side in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area. Her rates her right-sided TMJ pain at 10, average daily pain at 10, jaw function at 9, diet at 9, disability at 10. Her right TMJ has been locked now for 9 weeks. She has moderate earaches, has moderate tinnitus, and moderate vertigo. No other joints bother her. She has problems with nausea and vomiting. Her vision is affected particularly on the right side. She also has developed GI problems. She has pain down on the right side through her head, TMJ, jaw, neck, and shoulder area. She gets numbness through her right arm. She is in bed frequently. She has had two occasions where she had to go to the emergency room for pain relief. She currently takes the following medications:

Vyvanse 70 mg.
Synthroid 0.1 mg.
Reglan 10 mg.
Mobic 15 mg.
Fioricet q.4 hours.
Treximet one time per week.
Xanax 0.5 mg 1 to 3 per day.
In frontal view, B034 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. There is symmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. The maxillary midline is about 1 mm off to the right as is the mandibular dental midline. Chin is probably about 5 mm off to the right side. In profile view, B034 is about 5 mm AP deficient in the maxilla and about 18 to 18 mm deficient in the mandible. Chin neckline is quite short creating fullness in the submental area. Intraorally, she is missing the lower first bicuspids and upper first bicuspids. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship, being probably 5 mm Class II. She has some slight spacing between the cuspids and second bicuspids in all four quadrants. She has adequate attached gingiva. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged particularly on the right side. She does have a history of moderate snoring. She has moderate to severe daytime somnolence. She may have mild to moderate sleep apnea. She is predominantly a mouth breather at nighttime and also breathes through her mouth a lot during the day. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the right temporalis, right medial pterygoid, right retromandibular area, and right shoulder. The maximal opening is 31 mm, opening without pain 14 mm. The excursion movements are 6 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The left second molars in both the upper and lower arch appear to have advanced carious lesions as does the maxillary right second molar. The sinuses appear relatively clear. The condyles appear a little bit arthritic but difficult to tell.

Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear. Right turbinate enlarged.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear and right turbinate is enlarged.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is displaced posteriorly in the fossa with an increased anterior joint space. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is moderately steep. Left condyle actually looks a little bit more arthritic than the right side.

Right TMJ tomogram shows arthritic changes in the joint with some anterior beaking. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with increased anterior joint space. The articular eminence is moderately steep.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good width. There is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is arthritic and has an unusual shape to it. There is some sclerosis on the top of it. There is decreased lateral joint space and superior joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a retruded maxilla and mandible and a moderately high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 8 mm at the soft palate level and about 5.5 mm at the base of the tongue. B034 has developed more recently clicking in the left joint as well and beginning to develop pain on that side. B034 developed hypothyroidism after the birth of her second child and she has been on thyroid medicine since that time. The onset was 3 years ago.

Basic diagnoses for B034 would be as:
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Severe mandibular AP hypoplasia. Class II occlusion.
High occlusal plane angle.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Hypertrophied right turbinate.
Severe headaches. Severe TMJ pain. Myofascial pain. Severe difficulties eating and chewing. Dental caries in the mandibular left and maxillary left second molars.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Dental restorations, if possible, on the left mandibular second molar and maxillary left second molar.
2. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
3. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise rotation. d.	Right inferior turbinectomy.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5. Restorative dentistry to reconstruct her teeth.

B034 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit flat across the top. There appears to be joint space and the disc appears to be in position. There is sclerosis on the head of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is flat across the top. There appears to be decreased lateral and medial joint space. The disc may be anteriorly and laterally displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking and sclerosis on the head of the condyle. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc may be slightly anteriorly displaced more so at the lateral aspect of the joint. The disc may be acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posterior in the fossa. The posterior joint space may be a little bit narrowed. On opening, there is early reduction and good translation of the condyle and the articular disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is somewhat arthritic with some anterior beaking and some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and there is thickening of the posterior band and a relatively narrow intermediate zone. There is significant fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with early reduction.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction.
Both discs are salvageable.
