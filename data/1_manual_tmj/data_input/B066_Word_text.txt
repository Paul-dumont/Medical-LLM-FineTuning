B066
B066 is 37 years old and referred by Drs. XXXX and XXXX. The only previous surgery she has had is removal of her wisdom teeth. She otherwise is in good health. Primary concerns that B066 has include the following:

Jaws not aligned properly.
Headaches.
Narrow smile.
Difficulty finding a bite relationship.
B066 reports that her jaw problems began when she was about 9 years old and that is when her headaches developed of unknown etiology. She had orthodontics from the age of 10 to 13. She has had acupuncture treatment for the past 2 years to try to control her headaches and more recently she went to the Diamond Headache Clinic in Chicago where they treated her with biofeedback. They diagnosed her as having tension in the jaws and at least currently they feel that that may be the primary etiology for her headaches. She rates her headaches, the severe ones that she gets two to three times a month, at a level of 9 in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area. She wakes up frequently with headaches in the morning that are at about a level of 5, but these usually subside during the day. It is only two to three times a month that she gets the real severe headaches. She rates her TMJ pain at 1, average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 1, diet at 1, disability at 5. She has no trouble with earaches and only occasionally gets tinnitus and vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at night time and also during the day. She takes the following medications:

Butterbur.
Magnesium.
D3, B2, multivitamins.
Acetyl-L-Carnitine. N-Acetyl-Cysteine.
She does use over-the-counter pain relievers such as Advil, aspirin, etc., for her headaches.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, she has a little bit more fullness in the right masseter muscle than the left side by probably a good 3-4 mm. This may be due to masseteric hyperplasia. Upper lip length is 24 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is shifted about 2 mm to the left as is the chin. When she shifts her chin towards the right side 2 mm of the midline, it does improve her facial balance except for the fullness in the masseter area on the right side. In profile, upper lip is retruded by may 3-4 mm and the chin is retruded by 15-20 mm. Chin neckline is extremely shortened, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. The lower lip is somewhat retrusive and everted. Intraorally, B066 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. She has some mild crowding of the lower anterior arch, but transverse width of the lower arch is somewhat constricted. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. The anterior teeth are somewhat crowding. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship by probably 2-3 mm on the right side and probably 4-5 mm on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 2 mm. She has an overjet of 2-3 mm. Transversely, the occlusal plane is level at the first bicuspid area, but at the cuspid area the right cuspid is short in vertical height by at least 2 mm compared to the rest of the teeth on the right side. B066 has very prominent alveolar ridges surrounding her teeth, particularly in the anterior mandibular area from cuspid to cuspid, and, to a lesser degree, she has fullness around the maxillary posterior teeth. B066 has almost a reverse curve of Wilson in the upper arch and almost a fairly accentuated curve of Wilson in the lower arch. She also demonstrates about 6 mm of lip incompetence. Septum appears to be maybe slightly deviated off towards the left side. Turbinates appear large and appear somewhat boggy and inflamed. To palpation, she has very minimal tenderness over the left temporalis and left TMJ area. On opening, she has a click in the right joint as she comes across the articular eminence. She has more translation in the right joint than the left joint. I believe this is the clicking and popping that she is referring to. On excursion movements, I could palpate a little bit of crepitation in her joints and she states as she opens to a certain point, she hears a little bit of crepitus in the left joint. Maximal incisal opening is 52 mm and she could open comfortably to 20 mm and hold it in that position. Excursion movements are about 8 mm in each direction. B066 appears to have a little bit of posterior yaw with the molars being shifted towards the right side 1-2 mm. This likely accounts for the slight increased fullness in the right side of the face besides the masseteric hyperplasia that may be a little bit greater on the right side than the left side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a root canal on the mandibular right second molar and left first molar. Sinuses appear relatively clear. TMJ joints appear a little bit arthritic. Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. There is a little deviation of the nasal septum off towards the left side. Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The right turbinate is moderately enlarged and the left one appears a little bit more normal. Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that is a little bit arthritic with a little bit of anterior beaking present. There is a slight decreased posterior joint space, but the rest of the joint space appears fairly well balance, although at the lateral aspect of the joint it narrows. Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show arthritis and some anterior beaking and a little bit of sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Joint space may be just slightly decreased anteriorly, but otherwise appears fairly well balanced. Left TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably a good 3-4 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space indicative of probable medial displacement of the articular disc. Right TMJ coronal tomograms likewise show a condyle with good mediolateral width. There is a little bit more sclerosis in this condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a good 4 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space indicative of medial displacement of the articular disc. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B066 has maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia as well as mandibular AP hypoplasia. She has a skeletal Class II relationship. Airway however appears reasonably good with an AP dimension of 7.5 mm at the base of the tongue and 8 mm at the soft palate level. She has a moderately high occlusal plane angle.

Basic diagnoses for B066 would be as follows:
Maxillary AP, posterior vertical, and transverse hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP and transverse hypoplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion. Mandible is deviated to the left side 2 mm.
Posterior yaw with maxilla and mandible shifted towards the right side about 2-3 mm.
Crowding of the lower anterior arch.
Mild crowding upper anterior arch. Maxillary right cuspid positioned superiorly, but also with loss of cuspid tip.
Missing crown on mandibular left first molar.
Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular discs that are slightly medially displaced but asymptomatic.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Place temporary crown on mandibular left first molar and bond onto the right maxillary cuspid to achieve normal crown contours.
Presurgical orthodontics. Begin aligning and leveling the maxillary arch. Place brackets on the posterior teeth from the cuspids through the second molars but no arch wire. Surgery Stage 1. Placement of distraction osteogenesis device.
Mandibular vertical midline osteotomy.
Initiate distraction osteogenesis, expanding the mandible 6-8 mm.
Orthodontics.
Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery Stage 2.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction and expand it. Augmentation genioplasty.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Place definitive crowns on the mandibular left first molar and maxillary right cuspid.

B066 MRI AGE:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears to be medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width with a downward slope towards the lateral pole of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space. Disc appears to be medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has anterior beaking and some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. Articular disc is not seen as well at the lateral aspect, but appears to be in reasonably good position through the rest of the joint. There is significant inflammatory processes seen. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc with the disc in normal position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some anterior beaking and sclerosis on the head. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. Articular disc appears to be in good position, but at the lateral aspect of the joint it is not as readily seen indicative of medial displacement. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space and along the posterior aspect of the condyle. In the open views, there is good translation of both the condyle and the articular disc with the disc in a normal-appearing position.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc medially displaced. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc medially displaced.
