B039
B039 is 46 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. She is not sure when her joint problems began but was at least aware of symptoms 15 years ago. She originally had orthodontics from the age of 8 to 13. She developed a deviated mandibular prognathism and went back into orthodontics from the age of 21 to 22. Twenty-five years ago, she underwent bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to correct the mandibular asymmetry. She did fairly well for a while, but during the last 8 to 10 years, her bite has been “managed” by Dr. XXXX with crowns, equilibrations, etc. She has had “mouth guards” for at least the past 20 years.

She gets headaches about 3 times per week in the frontal and temporal areas bilaterally at a level of 3. She rates her TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at 8, jaw function, diet, and disability at 6. The incisal opening is 48 mm and 35 mm without significant pain. The excursion movement to the right is 8 mm, to the left 9 mm. She has an audible crepitation in the left TMJ. On the right side, she has an opening click at about 35 mm and a closing click at about 15 mm. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the TMJs and retromandibular area and milder pain through most of the rest of the head and neck area. She has no earaches, tinnitus nor vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is aware of clenching at nighttime. The medications she takes include the following:

Cymbalta 30 mg q.d.
Motrin 4 to 6 tablets per day.
Advil p.r.n.
She feels that the medication requirements are more for her neck and shoulder pain than for her jaw joint pain. To manage this severe pain, she gets osteopathic treatments and she does an inversion table procedure on a daily basis. Surgery has been recommended on her neck, but she is trying to avoid it. She apparently has stenosis, arthritis, degenerative disks, etc., in the neck.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has arthritis in both joints. There are wires in the ramus areas indicative of vertical oblique osteotomies that were done previously for her deviated mandibular prognathism.

Coronal radiograph shows that she has had previous turbinate reductions with total removal of the turbinate on the right side and partial removal on the left side. The sinuses appear reasonably clear with just a little bit of thickening of the sinus membrane in the floor of the right maxillary sinus.

Axial view shows that she has a nasal septal deviation anteriorly significantly off to the left side. The left turbinate has been removed anteriorly, but it has a moderate size more posteriorly. The sinuses appear relatively clear.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show that she has severe arthritis in this joint with very minimal joint space and probable bone-on-bone articulation. The articular eminence is moderately flat.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has anterior beaking and an osteophytic extension upwards towards the articular eminence. There is decrease joint space anteriorly between this osteophytic formation and the eminence. The articular eminence is moderately flat.

Left TMJ coronal view shows advanced arthritis and with significantly decreased joint space. There are pseudocysts in the head of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm and there appears to be actually some almost inward curvature at the inferior aspect of the lateral rim.

Right TMJ coronal tomograms show decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint and a little osteophytic sort of development extending out towards the lateral rim of the fossa. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is good AP facial balance and a good oropharyngeal airway.
Diagnosed for B039 would be as follows:
Left TMJ severe arthritis.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Cervical arthritis, stenosis and degenerative disks (by history).

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics: Place appliances on maxillary and mandibular teeth.
2. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints.
3. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B039 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite arthritic, but with sclerosis of the head of the condyle. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly 1 to 2 mm with a fairly sharp downward curvature at the lateral aspect. The condyle appears to have lost some vertical dimension. It is difficult to identify discal tissue.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width and looks more normal. The joint space looks better except it is decreased at the lateral aspect of the joint. There may be discal tissue medially and anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is severely arthritic with sclerosis on the head of the condyle and anterior beaking. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence with severe deformation and extremely short anteroposterior dimension. There is a significantly decreased vertical joint space. There is a moderate slope to the articular eminence. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced and with severe deformation and degeneration.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. The articular disc appears to be in position in this joint. The articular eminence has a moderate steepness but fairly long slope. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. The disc is in reasonably good position but does not cover the entire head anteroposteriorly. The top of condyle is fairly flat and the flatness on top of the condyle extends further posterior than the disc covers. There is a little bit of an osteophytic formation on the posterior head of the flattened condyle that extends slightly upwards behind the posterior band of the disc. There is good translation of the condylar head and disc with the disc in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction and with severe deformation and degeneration. The disc is non-salvageable. Right TMJ slightly anterior position of the disc and some mild arthritic changes of the head of the condyle.

Based on the MRI, treatment of choice would be:
Left TMJ total joint prostheses.
If right TMJ is symptomatic, then consider posterior repositioning of the articular disc with a sagittal split osteotomy. If the patient is asymptomatic, then no treatment to the right side.
