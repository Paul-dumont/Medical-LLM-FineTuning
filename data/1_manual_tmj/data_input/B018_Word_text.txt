B018
B018 is 52 years old and referred by XXXX.
B018's TMJ problems began 21 years ago. As a police office, she was on a foot chase after a suspect, tripped over a wire hidden in the grass and fell striking her chin, then her chest, abdomen, and then her legs. She sustained injury to her TMJ joints. She had an open laceration that required repair. Twenty-one years ago, we believe that XXXX attempted to put the articular discs back in place. She was reoperated in the following year by XXXX. During one of the procedures, and we think it is the second procedure, Silastic implants were placed. She is not aware that those implants have ever been removed. Sixteen years ago, XXXX performed bilateral mandibular ramus sagittal split osteotomies. She had orthodontics at age 34. She had sinus lift procedure and implants done three years ago, but she had other dental implants placed prior to then. She got her first TMJ splints 21 years ago and has had at least 15 splints since that time. She currently does not wear one as it does not seem to help her.

B018 takes the following medications:
Fentanyl patch 50 mcg per hour.
Percocet 5/325 four tablets per day. Ambien 10 mg tablets q.h.s.
Xanax 10 mg q.h.s.
Estrogen.
Progesterone.

B018 rates her headaches that she gets every day and they are continuous there all the time in the frontal, temporal, posterior head, and top of the head at a level of 5. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 5, jaw function and diet at 7, and disability at 9. She gets earaches, but no tinnitus nor vertigo. Other joints that bother her are primarily her neck where she has some bulging discs. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at nighttime. She has mild snoring, mild daytime somnolence, but she is not aware of sleep apnea. She has a moderate sleep disorder that she attributes mainly to her pain problems. She has some mild to moderate problems with mouth breathing.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B018 has reasonably good facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 1 mm. The maxillary midline is shifted off to the left side about 2-3 mm. The mandibular dental midline is also off to the left side about 2-3 mm. The chin is slightly to the left about 1-2 mm. In re-evaluation of her facial symmetry in frontal view, the nasal tip is actually off to the right side about 2 mm. The maxillary and mandibular dental midline are fairly close to being on the facial midline, and chin is off to the right side about 2 mm. She may have some slight AP deficiency in the maxilla and mandible, but in the chin only about 4-5 mm. Chin neckline and angle are not well defined. Intraorally, she is missing mandibular left second bicuspid, first molar, and bilateral third molars. In the upper arch, she is missing the left third molar and in the right side she is missing the bicuspids and molars which have all been replaced with four implants. The mandibular left second bicuspid has been replaced by an implant, and she has 3-unit bridge to the second molar. She has crowns on the second bicuspid and molars in mandibular right side and crowns on the second bicuspid and molars in the maxillary left arch. She has veneers on her maxillary central incisor. She is basically Class I cuspid on the right side. She is just slight Class II end-on on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of about 4 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues looks reasonably healthy. Uvula is moderately elongated. She had tonsils and adenoids removed as a child. Intranasally, it is difficult to evaluate the turbinates, but she does have a significant septal deviation off towards the left side that seems to blocking a portion of the airway, and that is probably about 1 cm or so back inside the nose. Anteriorly, the septum appears to deviate just slightly off towards the right side at the columella area. B018 has high moderate to low severe pain to palpation in the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, and styloids area. She has moderate pain over the medial pterygoids, SCMs, and milder pain over the posterior neck and shoulder area. Maximal incisal opening is 44 mm, but only about 20 mm without pain. Excursion movements are about 7 mm in each direction. She has numbness to the lower right lip and chin area from her previous surgery.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars as well as missing the maxillary right first and second bicuspids, first and second molars, and missing the mandibular second bicuspid, first molar. She has four implants in the maxillary right posterior quadrant, and one implant in the second bicuspid area in the left mandibular quadrant with a 3-unit bridge in place. She has crowns on the maxillary left second bicuspid and molars and essentially all the posterior teeth on the right side except for the mandibular first bicuspid. Both joints look quite arthritic. Sinuses look relatively clear. Coronal view shows that she has quite large turbinates particularly in the right side of the nose, and she has a significantly deviated nasal septum with a large bone spur coming off the left side that appears to touch almost against the lateral nasal wall. Sinuses look relatively clear with just a little bit of fluid in the base of the right sinus. Axial view shows septum deviated off towards the left side. Sinuses look relatively clear in this view, but the turbinates are enlarged. Left TMJ sagittal tomograms shows a condyle that appears arthritic with some anterior beaking. Joint space may be somewhat decreased. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. There is anterior beaking present on the condyle. Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show some arthritic changes particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint with significantly decreased joint space there. Condyle looks narrow anteroposteriorly towards the medial aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit narrow in width. Joint space may be a little bit narrow vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows a significantly decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint and over medially the joint appears a little bit more towards normal. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 3 to 4 mm. There appears to be almost bone-on-bone contact at the lateral rim of the fossa. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she is pretty much skeletal Class I. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue measures about 8 mm and at the soft palate maybe about 7 mm. There is a cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being almost 2 mm higher than the left side.

In talking with B018, it appears what may have been put in her joints, at least she remembers XXXX telling her, was that was Proplast Teflon that had been put in the joints. Thus, she may have a foreign body giant cell reaction in there as well.

Basic diagnoses for B018 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis with degenerated articular discs and foreign body giant cell reaction secondary to previously placed Proplast Teflon implants. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
AP mandibular hypoplasia.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Sleep apnea symptoms (snoring, daytime somnolence, obstructive episodes, etc.)
Hypertrophied turbinates. Deviated nasal septum off to the left side with septal spurring. Nasal airway obstruction. Missing mandibular left second bicuspid, first molar, maxillary right bicuspids and molars with the maxillary right four teeth and mandibular left second bicuspid replaced with dental implants. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 2 mm lower than the left side.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. CT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction using the TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it in a counterclockwise direction. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). Bilateral coronoidotomies.
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty. Application of maxillary and mandibular arch bars if orthodontics are not performed. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B018 MRI AGE: 52/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit narrow in width. There appears to be discal tissue anteriorly positioned. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat in some areas, and in other areas it may rotate downwards about 3 mm or so. The condyle appears a little flat across the top.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit greater width. Joint space may be a little bit decreased out laterally. There may be discal tissue displaced medially. There could be some discal tissue anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little arthritic. Out laterally, there is a little bit of anterior beaking. Joint space appears to be decreased. It is difficult to see the disc at the very lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is elongated and moderately steep. The disc appears deformed as though it could almost have a perforation through it, but it is in position. The appears to be some remnant of the disc superior to the top of the condyle and also anterior to the condyle with not much in between. In the T2 films, it appears that the disc could be posteriorly displaced, but other views in the T2 pictures, at least one view, show the disc could be in position. There is significant arthritis present in this joint. On opening, there appears to be discal tissue that is in position, and there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the disc.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows some arthritic changes with a little sclerosis on the head of the condyle and some flattening as well as some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Out lateral, the disc appears to be anteriorly displaced and may seem in a little bit better position more medially. Far medial, it is difficult to identify discal tissue. On opening, there is reasonable translation of the condyle and it appears that the disc may be in position on opening.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ disc probably in reasonable position with some arthritic changes present on the condylar head. Right TMJ articular disc anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint, but appears to reduce on opening.
