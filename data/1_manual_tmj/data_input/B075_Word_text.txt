B075
B075 is 15 years and 10 ½ months of age. B075 was born with a cleft palate that was repaired at the age of 7 months. He then had a pharyngeal flap performed at the age of 4. He has had several sets of tubes in his ears. He takes no medications except occasional allergy medicines. He has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain, tinnitus, or vertigo. He gets occasional earaches. No other joints are of concern at this time. He rates jaw function at 9, diet at 1, and disability at 0.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B075 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is probably about 3 mm off to the left side. The mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the left side. The chin is about 1 mm off to the left side. In profile view, upper lip is probably about 5 mm AP deficient and the chin is about 20 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is extremely short, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. He has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. Intraorally, B075 is missing the lower first bicuspids that were extracted for orthodontic reasons. The lower teeth are almost a little bit over retracted. In the upper arch, he is missing the first bicuspids and may be missing the second bicuspids all on the left side. He has an anterior open bite of about 1 to 2 mm. He has a Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and to a lesser extent a non-Class II relationship on the left side. Upper teeth are pulled back in significantly lingual inclination. He has adequate attached gingiva, although the gingiva are somewhat inflamed. The lower arch is fairly symmetric relative to the AP position of the cuspids. In the upper arch, the left cuspid is probably about 3 mm posterior to the right cuspid. He has a nice repair on the palate. There is a pharyngeal flap present with an oronasal opening in the mid part of the flap. The palate appears nicely repaired. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal as does the septum. He has some mild nasal airway obstruction. He has moderate to severe snoring, moderate daytime somnolence, but does not have any sleep apnea symptoms apparently. He has a moderate sleep disorder. B075 tends to breathe more through his mouth than his nose except when he is out in public when it gets much easier. B075 has no tenderness around the head and neck area to palpation. Joints function smoothly. Incisal opening is 43 mm and excursion movements are about 7 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the presence of four impacted third molars. He is missing the first bicuspids in all 4 quadrants plus the second bicuspid in the left maxillary quadrant. Right sinus appears to have something in it. It is difficult to evaluate the TMJs. Waters view shows that there is a septal spur going off the right side of the septum. Turbinates are moderate in size. Sinuses look relatively clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows that a condyle that has fairly good morphology and there appears to reasonable joint space, though difficult to evaluate radiograph. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ tomogram is likewise a little bit hard to read, but it appears that everything is relatively normal there. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B075 has a retruded maxilla, significantly retruded mandible, and a high occlusal plane angle. He has a low positioned pharyngeal flap also present. Upper and lower incisors are decreased in angulation. He has a head postured forward neck position.

Basic diagnoses for B075 would be as follows:
Repaid palatal cleft.
Posterior pharyngeal flap. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.
AP mandibular hypoplasia. Class II occlusion on the right side, Class II end-on occlusion on the left side. Missing appears second bicuspids in the lower arch, maxillary right second bicuspid, and mandibular left first and second bicuspids. Maxillary dental midline shifted 3 mm to the left of the facial midline. Anterior open bite.
Impacted third molars x4.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Open up space between the left cuspid and first molar to equal about 6 mm (about the same width as the bicuspid on the opposite side) as this will improve the overall dental fit as well as flare the upper incisors forward and align them better on to the facial midline.
Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Monitor facial growth and development.
Surgery.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward about 6 mm, level it transversely, and expand if necessary. Lengthen the pharyngeal flap, if necessary, to accommodate the maxillary advancement. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward approximately 18 mm. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5. Restorative dentistry. a. Place osteointegrated implant to the maxillary left bicuspid area. b. Place crown on maxillary left implant.

B075 MRI AGE: 17/M
Left TMJ coronal view shows a small condyle with significant loss of condylar structure. There is decreased superior joint space. There may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with a downward curvature of probably about 2 mm. There may be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is small in size with loss of vertical and mediolateral volume. This condyle appears a little bit larger than the opposite side. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably a couple of millimeters. Difficult to identify discal tissue, but there may be some anterior to the condyle. There may be a little bit of fluid in the right joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic and sclerotic. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced and sitting towards the articular eminence. The articular eminence is moderately steep, but appears elongated. The disc appears to be deformed. On opening, it appears that the disc does reduce in position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have undergone resorption and is very narrow anteroposteriorly with a decreased superior and posterior joint space. The disc is anteriorly displaced. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening, the disc appears to reduce and there is moderately good translation of the condyle. The disc itself, however, does not appear to move very well and may be adhered to the fossa.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis and articular discs anteriorly dislocated, but it appears there is reduction on opening but with deformation of the articular discs.
