B207
B207 is 55 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B207 TMJ's problems began 9 months ago. Within the year prior to that, she had had thyroid surgery and also gallbladder surgery. It was about 5 months after the thyroid surgery that she began developing clicking and popping in the jaw joints. At first it did not bother her a whole bunch, but then she began developing pain and headaches with it. Five months ago, her first splint was made and she is now on her second splint. She also started chiropractic treatment and had approximately 20 treatments. Three months ago, she began massage therapy and does that now about once a week and finds that more beneficial than the chiropractic treatment.

B207 rates her headaches in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area at about a level of 6. TMJ pain is at 6, average daily pain at 4, jaw function and diet at 7, disability at 4. She gets occasional earaches, frequent tinnitus, but no vertigo or hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her knees, ankles, fingers, and her neck. Radiographically, she has compressed vertebrae at approximately C4-C5. She had thyroid disease for which she had a total thyroidectomy and in the process her recurrent laryngeal nerve was damaged on the left side. She also has had gallbladder surgery performed within the past year. She is aware of clenching her teeth at night time and also during the day time. She has been tested for rheumatoid arthritis and these results are negative.

She currently takes the following medications:
Synthroid 100 mcg q.d.
Lexapro 10 mg q.d.
Klonopin 0.5 mg 1 to 2 q.h.s.
Flexeril 10 mg q.h.s.
Glucosamine 3 per day.
Omega 3 2000 mg q.d.
CQ-10 (vitamin).
Calcium 1500 mg with vitamin D 1000 mg.

Primary concerns that B207 has include the following:
Constant pain in her jaws and neck.
Unable to chew her food and raw vegetables.
Decreased jaw opening.
Headaches.
Snoring.
Moderate daytime tiredness.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B207 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20. Upper tooth lip relationship is about zero. The maxillary midline is just slightly to the left about 1 mm. The mandibular dental midline and chin are closer to being on the facial midline. In profile view, B207 has some slight AP maxillary deficiency of about 3 to 4 mm and AP deficiency in the mandible of about 8 to 10 mm. Chin neckline is short and chin neck angle is not real well defined. Intraorally, B207 has all of her lower teeth through the second molars. She has some moderate crowding of the lower anterior arch. There is some hyper-eruption of the cuspid and the anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth. She has an anterior deep bite of probably about 3 mm. She has bilateral posterior open bites in part related to the splint therapy that she is having. She is basically a Class I cuspid on the left side and slight Class II on the right side by probably 2 mm. Posterior open bites are about 2 on the left side and 3 on the right side. With the splint in place, the splint covers only the bicuspids and molars and leaves the cuspids and incisors out of occlusion. Oropharyngeal tissues appear reasonably healthy. Soft palate may be slightly elongated. Intranasally, the septum is deviated a little off towards to the left side, but the left turbinate appears relatively normal to small in size. Right turbinate appears moderate in size, but it appears that there is a passable airway. To palpation, she has mild tenderness throughout most of the head and neck area. Joints are not particularly uncomfortable to palpation. She has fairly constant pain in the jaw joint, particularly with any type of jaw function.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The first molars in the lower arch have crowns on them. She has a root canal on the mandibular left lateral incisor. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Right turbinate appears enlarged. The condyles appear arthritic with flattening on the anterior heads. The left condyle appears slightly smaller than the right side. Articular eminences are moderately steep. Left TMJ sagittal views show some anterior beaking in the left condyle and some significant flattening on the posterior head of the condyle. There is significant anterior beaking particularly towards the medial side. The lateral side of the condyle has a little bit better morphology. Articular eminence is quite steep. The condyle appears to be posteriorly displaced in the fossa with an increased anterior joint space. Right TMJ sagittal view shows condyle that has a greater amount of bone change on the posterior head of the condyle. The condyle has a hockey stick shape to it, particularly towards the medial aspect of the joint. It appears there may be some erosions on the cortical head of the condyle, particularly at the lateral margin. The condyle has an unusual shape to it in the mid-part of the condylar head. The condyle actually appears postured forward in the fossa with increased vertical and posterior joint space. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is arthritic and actually has erosive changes in the condylar head. There appears to be decreased joint space at the lateral pole of the condyle. The vertical joint space appears decreased at the lateral aspect of the joint. Right TMJ shows the there appears to be a little bit of erosion in the head of the condyle, particularly adjacent to the lateral rim of the fossa. There is decreased joint space in this area, but good joint space vertically at the medial half of the condyle. Axial view show that the right turbinate is quite large and may obliterate part of the nasal airway. Sinuses look relatively clear. Coronal view shows that there is deviation of the bony nasal septum with a septal spur extending off towards the left side that may be causing significant obstruction of the airway on that side. Turbinate on the right side is quite large and it appears it could be causing some significant nasal airway problems. Sinuses are clear involving both the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there a mild AP maxillary and mandibular deficiency. The oropharyngeal airway is somewhat decreased particularly at the soft palate level. She appears to have a moderately high occlusal plane angle and she has posterior open bites. B207 has no significant tooth size discrepancy.

The basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction on the left side but with reduction on the right side.
AP maxillary hypoplasia.
Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.
AP mandibular hypoplasia. Decreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 mm (normal 11 mm).
Bilateral posterior open bites.
Crowding in the lower anterior arch. TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain. Polyarthropathy with numerous other joints involved including the neck, knees, ankles, wrists, fingers, etc.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Sleep study to evaluate for sleep apnea. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip the lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla and down graft it posteriorly to decrease the occlusal plane angle.
Bilateral mandibular coronoidotomies to maintain function of the temporalis muscle. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B207 MRI AGE: 54/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a left condyle that has undergone severe degenerative changes. There is also significant degenerative changes in the fossa. There appears to be increased soft tissue mass in this joint. There may be some erosions in the fossa. The condyle appears to be rotated out laterally in reference to the lateral rim of the fossa and extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There is discal tissue medial and anterior to the disc. The disc appears to be completely on the medial side of the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat arthritic. There is a bony extension medially. The articular disc is medially displaced with fairly minimal coverage over the medial aspect of the condyle. Probably less than a quarter of the condyle is covered by the disc at this time. The lateral rim is fairly flat. There appears to be increased soft tissue thickness within the joint space area.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that out laterally has reasonably good morphology, but more medially it is flattened with increased vertical joint space. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. It is more prominent towards the medial aspect of the joint than lateral. It appears that there is some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the condyle translates forward almost beneath the articular eminence, but the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced and significantly deformed. In the closed position, the disc is short anteroposteriorly and appears degenerated.

The right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that actually has a little bit more deformity to it, particularly associated with the posterior head of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is medially displaced, and, towards the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc is not quite as identifiable. The disc may also be anteriorly displaced. There is significant fluid in the superior joint space throughout the joint space. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in a reduced position, however, towards the more lateral aspect of the joint, the disc is hard to identify consistent with the medial displacement.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced without reduction and with significant deformation and degeneration of the articular disc. dislocated without reduction with significant deformation. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteromedially displaced with reduction on opening and in anteroposterior position, but still displaced medially.
