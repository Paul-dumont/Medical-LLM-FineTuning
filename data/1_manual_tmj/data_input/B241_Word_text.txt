B241
B241 is 22 years old. An orthodontist had suggested that they come to see us, but it was probably Dr. ____ who was the initial referring person.

Primary concerns that B241 has include the following:
Severe pain due to limited jaw function. Cannot chew.
Headaches. Lower jaws recede.
She has some mild snoring, but no daytime somnolence and no apparent sleep apnea problems. She is predominantly a mouth breather at nighttime.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B241 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3 mm. Right central incisor is a little bit lower than the left central incisor. The maxillary, mandibular and chin line are fairly on the facial midline. The nasal tip is just slightly to the right side about 1 mm or 2. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale. The maxilla appears to be probably about 6 mm AP deficient. Chin appears to be about 15 to 18 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is shortened and chin neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B241 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. There is reasonably attached gingiva. There appears to be a little bit of inflammation. There is a little bit of calculus along the cervical margins of the central incisors. The labial frenulum is a little high attached. In the upper arch, B241 has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. When she bites her teeth together, she occludes on her second molars and perhaps just a little bit the first molars, but all other teeth throughout the bite are nonoccluding. In centric relation, she has an anterior open bite of about 1 to 2 mm. She has Class II end-on being slightly worse on the right side than the left side by probably 3 mm on the left and 4 to 5 mm on the right. The oropharyngeal tissues at the uvula is slightly elongated as is the soft palate. The fascial pillars are moderately constricted. The tonsil on the right side appears relatively normal in size, but the left one appears somewhat enlarged. It appears there is a slight amount of transverse deficiency in the oropharyngeal dimension. Transversely, the maxilla is fairly level. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderate in size. The septum may be deviated just slightly to the right side. She may have mild to moderate nasal airway obstruction. Columella is moderately wide. To palpation, B241 has moderate tenderness over the masseters and TMJs and milder tenderness over the temporalis muscles. Joints function relatively smooth. Maximal incisal opening is 30 mm and opening without pain probably 2 mm. She had about 3.5 mm of excursion movement in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. It is difficult to evaluate the sinuses, but they look relatively clear. She appears to have severe arthritis in both joints. Waters view shows that the bony septum appears reasonably straight. Turbinates are moderate in size. Sinuses appear clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows that a condyle that is quite small in size with evidence of significant vertical and anteroposterior resorption. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has also undergone significant resorptive changes. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space appears slightly better than the opposite side. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyles with the condyles coming forward along the posterior slope of the articular eminence. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the mandible is actually postured forward in position so this radiograph was not taken in centric. However, it shows she does have an anterior open bite and appears to occlude on the second molar area. She has a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures about 3.5 mm at the most and at the base of the tongue it is probably 3 to 4 mm as well. There is a tooth size discrepancy with a 's difference of 2 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B241 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis (probable adolescent internal condylar resorption) with articular discs dislocated and severely degenerated.
AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.
Class II end-on occlusion being worse on the right side. Occludes only on the left first and second molars with all other teeth out of occlusion.
Anterior open bite of 2 mm and open bite extending from the left first molar through the right second molar. Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm (normal dimension 11 mm).
Hypertrophied turbinates. Partial nasal airway obstruction. High occlusal plane angulation. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract.
Place brackets on the second molars, but do not extend the arch wires to the second molars.
CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it and down graft it posteriorly to decrease the occlusal plane angle and maximize the occlusal fit. Bilateral coronoidotomies.
Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest graft from the abdomen). Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B241 I-CAT AGE: 22/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Right TMJ frontal view shows significant arthritic changes and significant decrease in the joint space. The condyle has lost vertical volume. In sagittal view, the condyle is quite small and degenerated. There is significant anterior beaking. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a significant loss of volume and degenerative changes. There is significantly decreased joint space vertically.

In sagittal view, the condyle is quite small and deformed. There is some anterior beaking present. There is significantly decreased superior and posterior joint space.

Left turbinate appears exceptionally large. Septum in the one view available appears to be reasonably straight. The sinuses appear clear in the one view that they can be seen.

B241 MRI AGE: 22/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant degenerative changes. There is significant loss of volume including vertical as well as mediolaterally. There is significantly decreased joint space. There may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with no more than a 2 mm downward curvature.

Right TMJ coronal view likewise shows a condyle that has undergone significant degenerative changes with significant loss of volume including vertical and mediolateral. This condyle may be even slightly smaller than the opposite side. There is decreased superior joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly no more than 2 mm. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost significant vertical volume and may be a little bit narrow anteroposterior, but not too bad. The top of the condyle appears sclerotic. Articular eminence is moderately steep and slightly elongated. Articular disc is sitting beneath the articular disc and significantly deformed. It is very short anteroposteriorly and thick. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle as it comes down short of the articular eminence. The disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is small in size with loss of vertical and anteroposterior volume. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is sitting beneath the articular eminence. It is short anteroposteriorly. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle coming down short of the articular eminence. The articular disc remains anteriorly displaced and significantly degenerated and deformed.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis changes (compatible with AICR) and articular disc dislocations without reduction and significant deformation and degenerative changes.
