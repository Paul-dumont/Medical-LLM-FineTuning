B233
B233 is 36 years old and referred by Dr. ___.
Primary concerns B233 has include the following:
Jaws are out of alignment making it difficult to chew.
Bite is significantly off. Speech is affected.
Headaches.
Swallowing difficulties.
Grinding teeth.

He takes Benicar 20 mg q.d. and albuterol inhaler as needed. He also takes ibuprofen taken almost every other day for headaches. He has been in orthodontic treatment since 7 months ago. He does have a history of asthma and high blood pressure.

The onset of B233's headaches and joint problems is unknown. He feels it has probably been there for several years. His headaches have gotten significantly worse since he began orthodontics 7 months ago. The etiology is unknown. B233 did have orthodontics when he was a teenager around the age of 13 to 14. He believes his bite was much better at that time. Then when he had his “growth spurt”, his lower jaw outgrew the upper jaw significantly.

B233 gets headaches about four times a week primarily in the temporal areas bilaterally and can get as high as a level of 4. He rates his TMJ pain at 1, average daily pain at 3, jaw function, diet and disability at 7. He gets infrequent earaches and tinnitus but has no vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother him. He is aware of clenching and bruxing at night time. He does have mild snoring, mild daytime somnolence, but he is not aware of having sleep apnea issues. He does have high blood pressure. He has a moderate sleep disorder. At night, he is predominantly a mouth breather and also during the day he breathes a lot through his mouth.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B233 has fairly good facial balance in the middle and upper third face. He has some asymmetry in the lower third face. Right angle of the mandible appears to be probably a good 8-10 mm wider on the right side as compared to the left side. Upper lip length is about 26 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is probably about minus 2. Maxillary midline may be about 1 mm off to the left. The mandibular dental midline is at least 5 mm off to the left. The chin midline is probably close to that as well off to the left. In profile view, he has some significant deficiency in the infraorbital rim projection with probably being close to 8-10 mm of AP infraorbital rim projection. He may have 2-3 mm of AP maxillary deficiency. Chin may be just slightly AP deficient by maybe 4-5 mm. Chin neckline has a moderate length and chin neck angle is well defined. Intraorally, B233 has all of his teeth back to the second molars. He has appliances on. Dental arch looks fairly well aligned. He has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has a super Class II occlusion on the right side being probably about 9 mm Class III and on left side is closer to being about 5 mm Class III. He has anterior open bite of probably around 2 mm. He occludes only the right side extending from probably the second bicuspid to the second molar that actually occlude. All the other teeth are out of occlusion. He has a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the maxillary left cuspid being down about 0.5 to 1 mm and with the mandibular left cuspid being almost 2 mm lower than the right side. He has an anterior and bilateral posterior cross bites, but the cross bite is significantly greater on the left side with the maxillary teeth being aligned almost completely lingual to the lower teeth. B233 has a posterior yaw with the maxilla being probably 2-3 mm to the right and the mandible is slightly off to the right side as well. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. Uvula is moderately enlarged. The rest of the structures look reasonably normal. Intranasally, he has a large septal spur off towards the left side towards the anterior part of the nose. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged, but difficult to assess them posteriorly. The turbinate on the left side appears to be positioned high superiorly within the nose as compared to the normal position. To palpation, B233 has some mild tenderness of the TMJs. Incisal opening is 43 mm and excursion movements are about 5 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. He appears to occlude only on his right maxillary second bicuspid, first molar, and lower first and second molars. Bony septum looks reasonably straight. He has an open bite anteriorly and completely around on the left side.

Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear. He has significantly enlarged turbinates on both sides with the left side actually being more obstructed than the right side.

Axial view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear with just a little bit of thickening of the mucosa at the posterior wall of the sinus. The septum appears reasonably straight in the bony area. Turbinates are enlarged and appear to block off a good part of the airway with the left side being larger than the right side.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that appears to have a significant anterior beaking present. In some areas, the condyle appears almost too large for the fossa. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination, although very short in length. The joint space does look reasonably good. It appears there could almost be a little excessive growth on the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the condyle gets extremely narrow anteroposteriorly. In the medial side of the joint, the condyle is back almost against the posterior wall of the fossa. The anterior joint space appears to be increased. The condylar head and neck appears may be longer on the left side as compared to the right side.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 4 mm. There appears to be decreased joint space out laterally between the condyle and the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be decreased joint space in the medial aspect of the joint where there is almost bone-on-bone contact. There is almost a double image of the cortical bone out in this area which is a little bit unusual.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B233 has a skeletal Class III relationship. He has got what appears to be a high occlusal plane angle. He has a decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of about 6 mm at the soft palate level and probably 7-8 mm at the base of the tongue. Vertical discrepancy can be easily seen at the inferior border of the mandible and also at the occlusal surface. The infraorbital deficiency can also be observed.

Tooth size analysis reveals a 's difference of 2.25 mm. There is a transverse maxillary deficiency of close to 15 mm. B233 does have a relative macroglossia.

Diagnoses for B233 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and disc displacements.
Maxillary AP, transverse, and vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular deviated prognathism.
Super Class III occlusion.
Anterior open bite.
Anterior and bilateral posterior cross bites with the cross bite being significantly greater on the left side than the right side. Hypertrophied turbinates creating nasal airway obstruction.
Large septal spur on the right side.
Headaches.
Malpositioned maxillary second molars bilaterally.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Continue to align and level the maxillary arch. Try to rotate the maxillary second molars palatally to get them in better alignment with the first molars in a transverse position as well as a vertical position. May need to position the brackets on the second molars closer to the occlusal surface or place a vertical step in the arch wire. b.	In the upper arch, tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdentally osteotomies. c.	Align and level the lower arch. Place brackets on the second molars to try to better align them, particularly on the left side where the second molar is slightly elevated in slight lingual inclination.
2.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral ramus osteotomies to rotate the mandible back onto the facial midline. c.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward, down graft it about 3-4 mm, and expand approximately 15 mm. d.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e.	Nasal septoplasty to remove large septal spur.
3.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B233 MRI --/--/----
DATE OF MRI ACQUISITION:	
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Difficult to identify discal tissue within the joint, although the joint space looks fairly good vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a relatively minimal amount. There is some sclerosis on top of the condyle. There may be some discal tissue displaced medially.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is also good vertical joint space but difficult to identify discal tissue. There may be discal tissue displaced medially.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears somewhat enlarged compared to the size of the fossa. There is significant anterior beaking and extension of the condyle. Articular disc actually appears to be in reasonably good position. The disc appears thickened. At the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc is more difficult to identify. There are some arthritic changes on the top of the condyle. On opening, there is good translation of the left condyle and disc with the disc in a reduced position.

Right TMJ shows a condyle that has a little bit different and unusual shape to it being extremely narrow anteroposteriorly in the mid part of the joint. The condyle is back against the posterior wall of the fossa and medial part of the joint. The disc is anteriorly displaced. The disc is thickened, particularly the posterior band and the intermediate zone seems to be a little bit narrow. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc is more difficult to identify. On opening, there is some restricted translation of the condyle but it does appear reduced onto the disc. There is poor translation of the disc, perhaps evidence of adhesions between the disc and the fossa.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ mild arthritic changes, but articular disc in fairly good AP position but with some medial displacement. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with reduction, but with adhesions of the disc to the fossa.
