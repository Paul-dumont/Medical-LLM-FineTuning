B243
B243 is 47 years old, referred by Dr. _____. Previous surgeries include a tonsillectomy 41 years ago, D&C 18 and 17 years ago and as well as uterus surgery 17 years ago and a hysterectomy 21 years ago. She had her gallbladder removed 4 years ago. In addition, B243 has thyroid problems and also an anxiety disorder.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Muscle and jaw pain.
Nighttime clenching and bruxism that creates significant pain.
Difficulties eating and chewing.
Significant noises in the jaw joints.

MEDICATIONS:
Paxil.
Synthroid.
Depo Estrogen 1.5 cc biweekly.
Xanax 5 mg p.r.n. Flexeril p.r.n. Hydrocodone 7.5 mg p.r.n. as needed at night.
She has had some reaction in the past to some pain medications, penicillin, erythromycin, and sulfa antibiotics.

B243's problems began to the best of her recollection of at least 5 years ago of unknown etiology. She was involved in a motor vehicle accident about 3 years ago which may have exacerbated her situation. She began orthodontic treatment 2 years ago with Dr. ____ and this was her first orthodontic treatment. She did go to see Dr. ____ for mandibular advancement but then she did not proceed with that surgery. Also had massage therapy performed. She does get occasional earaches, occasional tinnitus but no vertigo or hearing loss. The other joints that bother her include her right shoulder where she has a rotator cuff injury. She has problems with her right elbow and then bilaterally the wrists, hands and fingers get tender, sore and swollen. She has no known allergy to jewelry. She does have the previously stated allergies to medications.

She wakes up at night frequently with pain. She has a significant amount of clenching and bruxism at night and also during the day clenches significantly. She gets headaches almost on a daily basis at a level of 7 that occur predominately in the frontal area behind the eyes and in the temple area. She rates her TMJ pain at 9 particularly when she wakes up at night and in the morning. Average daily pain is around a level 5. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 4, disability at 4. B243 does say that her husband thinks that she is talking a lot louder now particularly when she is on the phone as compared to when she did a year or two ago indicative of perhaps some hearing changes.

B243
In frontal view, B243 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 1 mm. Maxillary dental midline, mandibular dental midline and chin are all pretty much aligned on the facial midline. In profile view, B243 has some AP deficiency in the maxilla and AP deficiency of the mandible. The chin appears to be 12 to 15 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is extremely short and chin neck angle is not identifiable. Intraorally, B243 has all of her teeth back through the molars. The lower teeth appear to be angulated forward excessively. She has thin, but appears to be adequately attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. She has a little bit of spacing on the left side between the cuspid and lateral incisor. The cuspids are fairly symmetric in AP position. In the upper arch B243 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has turbos on the maxillary central incisors. She has a Class II cuspid relationship being about 5 mm Class II. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. The uvula is fairly elongated. The soft palate appears elongated. There appears to be a short distance between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall area. Faucial pillars appear relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum may be a little bit off to the left side but not too bad. The left turbinate looks normal. The right turbinate is extremely large and hyperplastic filling a good part of the nasal airway on that side. Luminal valves, columella and nostrils are all pretty much within normal limits. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the TMJs, masseters, styloid areas, milder pain over the medial pterygoids, posterior neck and shoulder areas. Maximal incisal opening is 37 mm but only about 20 mm without significant discomfort. Excursive movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 5 mm. She has significant crepitation and it is actually audible in her joints. B243 does have severe snoring problems, severe daytime somnolence and she reports moderate to severe sleep apnea problems as well. B243 had a sleep study performed last year. Her sleep diagnoses were as follows:
Primary snoring but few apneas were hypopneas. Restless leg syndrome. Inadequate sleep hygiene. Sleep bruxism. Sleep talking. She had 2.15 apneas or hypopneas per hour of sleep. She had less than 1 dozen oxygen desaturations.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. Braces are on through the second molars on the right side and first molars on the left side. Joints look arthritic with the right side being worse than the left side. Sinuses look relatively clear.

Waters view show that the sinuses are clear. Right turbinate appears quite large. The nasal septum is deviated off to the left side particularly back in the bony area.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears arthritic and there is a decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is restricted translation in both joints but the condyle is not coming down to the eminence area.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that the maxilla and mandible appear AP retruded. Lower incisors are significantly overangulated. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level looks to be around 3 to 4 mm and at the base of the tongue approximately 5 mm. She has a relatively low occlusal plane angle. Chin is fairly prominent. There is a tooth size discrepancy with a 's difference of about 2 mm.

BASIC DIAGNOSES: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with perforations.
AP maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Class II occlusion. Overangulation of lower incisors.
Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway approximately 4 mm (normal 11 mm.)
Hyperplastic soft palate. Hyperplastic uvula.
TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.
Severe snoring.
Sleep apnea symptoms. Hypertrophied right nasal turbinate.
Partial nasal airway obstruction.
AP macrogenia.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Medications.
a. Klonopin 1 mg tablet 1 tablet q.h.s. to help eliminate clenching. 2. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies in case they are needed. Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure but remove more tooth structure on the right side compared to the left because the right incisors are larger than the left ones. Also, close the space in the mandibular left cuspid lateral incisor area. Consider slenderizing lower bicuspids removing about 1/2 mm of tooth structure from each of those teeth and retract. This will correct the tooth size discrepancy as well as decrease the over angulation of the lower incisors.

B243 MRI Evaluation 
Date of Acquisition: 
Date of Interpretation: 
This is a poor quality MRI.
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have significant arthritis. There is a lot of erosion on the head of the condyle. There may be some artifact present. There may be bone-on-bone contact. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a fair amount in one view probably 3 to 4 mm. In another view it appears that the lateral aspect of the condyle extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that likely has had some previous surgery. There appears to be significant arthritis in this joint. Lateral pole of the condyle extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some significant arthritic changes. Bone looks a little bit rough at the lateral aspect with some osteophytic formation. There may be a little bit of degenerative changes in the fossa as well but difficult to tell. Towards the middle part of the joint, the condyle is quite flattened posteriorly and there is some anterior beaking and a little sclerosis on the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced. Disc is sitting beneath the articular eminence. Disc appears degenerated. On open view, there is fairly minimal translation of the condyle. The disc remains anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence area. The disc may be adhesed to the eminence. The condyle looks quite arthritic in the open view. Articular eminence appears quite steep in the open view.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic. Towards the medial aspect it is quite narrow anteroposterior. At the lateral aspect it appears wider. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The posterior head of the condyle is quite flattened. Anterior beaking is present. Decreased superior and posterior joint spaces. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint there is a large erosive area on the anterior aspect of the condyle. The disc is anteriorly displaced and very difficult to identify but may be sitting around the apex of the articular eminence. The disc appears significantly deformed. On open view, there is restricted translation of the condyle also on this side. The disc sits beneath the articular eminence with very little translatory movement and may be adhesed to the articular eminence. The articular eminence on this side does not appear to be quite as steep as the opposite side. Towards the lateral aspect of the joint, however, it is difficult to identify the articular eminence in some of the views indicative of perhaps some significant degenerative changes on the articular eminence.

IMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation with likely adhesions to the articular eminence and severe deformation. Highly questionable salvageability of the articular disc.
May be candidate for total joint prosthesis but will be dependent on clinical and radiographic assessment.
