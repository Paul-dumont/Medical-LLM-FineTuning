B263 
B263 is 15 years old and referred by Dr. __.
Patient History

B263 has had her adenoids and tonsils removed 11 years ago. She had sleep apnea at the age of 4. This pretty much eradicated her sleep apnea problems. She has some problems with seasonal allergies. She takes no medications. She has no known drug reactions.

She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, or headaches. She recently has been diagnosed as having some mild scoliosis. Her toes pop a lot but cause no other problems. She has an allergic reaction to most fruits and seasonal allergy problems. No known problems with jewelry. She used to clench and grind her teeth a lot but doesn't do that much anymore because her teeth just don't fit together at all.

To the best of her knowledge, her problems began about 2-1/2 years ago while she was in orthodontics. She said when she was wearing elastics she first noticed having some clicking and popping in her jaw joints. She had orthodontic appliances from the age of 13 to 14-1/2. Upon completion of the orthodontics, her bite was very good. Most of the changes in her occlusion have occurred since her braces have been removed. She rates her TMJ pain at 4 and pain on an average day is somewhere around 3. She rates her jaw function at 6, diet at 5, and disability at 3.

Patient Concerns
Teeth and jaws don't fit together
Jaw malalignment has been getting progressively worse
Speech has been significantly affected
Difficulty swallowing
Can't chew
Mouth is open all the time
Difficult to close the lips
Chronic mouth breathing.

Clinical Examination
In frontal view, B263 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 mm. In centric relation, maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline may be about 0.5 mm to the right, and chin is probably 1 to 2 mm to the right.

In profile, she has significant lip incompetence of about 12 mm. She has a slight C-shaped curve to the upper lip. Some slight AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 3 to 4 mm. Chin is retruded by approximately 18 mm. Chin-neckline is short, although the chin-neck angle is fairly well-defined. She has some lower lip evertion, and the lower lip is more prominent than the chin. In centric occlusion, she occludes only on the second molars bilaterally, and all other teeth are out of occlusion. She has about a 3-mm anterior open bite with a tendency toward crossbite on the right side and a tendency toward a buccal crossbite on the left side. She has an end-on Class II occlusion being probably close to 5 mm Class II. Oropharynx, soft palate, and uvula all look normal and healthy.

Intranasally, the nares are a little bit constricted. Transverse width of the nose is narrow. Turbinates are of moderate size but may be significantly contributory to some nasal airway obstruction.

To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the masseters, TMJs, styloid areas, SCMs, posterior neck, and shoulder area. On jaw function, she has a fairly palpable opening click at about 40 mm and closing click at 15 mm on the left side and probably at about the same on the right side but a little bit softer and more difficult to pick up by palpation. Maximal incisal opening is 52 mm. Excursive movements are 9 mm in each direction.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the presence of four impacted third molars with inadequate room for them to erupt in. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size, but septum appears fairly straight. Appears to be some degenerative changes of the condyles being a little bit greater on the left side as compared to the right side. Anterior open bite is quite evident.

Waters view shows the turbinates are moderate size with the left one being larger than the right and a little bit more airway obstruction on the left side compared to the right side. Maxillary sinuses appear clear as do the ethmoids. She doesn't have a frontal sinus of any significance on the right side and has a relatively small one on the left side, but it is clear. Jaws look fairly symmetric.

Left TMJ tomogram shows that the condyle is postured forward, so she may not have been in centric relation when the x-ray was taken, maybe postured forward slightly. She has a slightly increased posterior joint space. Anterior joint space appears somewhat decreased. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Anterior aspect of the condylar head appears flattened. It appears as though there has been significant loss of condylar volume.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears smaller than normal indicative of loss of condylar volume. Significant anterior beaking is present on this side. Superior joint space may be decreased slightly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Condylar head and neck appear foreshortened.

On opening views, there is good translation of the condyles bilaterally. The smallness of both condyles is seen in the forward position. In this particular position, there seems to be a little bit more sclerosis on the left condyle as compared to the right side. Articular eminences relatively have the same amount of inclination.

Cephalometrically, she has a significant Class II skeletal relationship. Has an anterior open bite of at least 3 mm. She has a skeletal and occlusal Class II relationship. Has a high occlusal plane angulation. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures about 4 mm and at the soft palate level measures about 3.5 mm at the base of the tongue (normal airway 11 mm). Appears to be plenty of room for the tongue intraorally as the tongue sits well below the height of the palate. Dental model analysis shows that she doesn't have any significant tooth-size discrepancy. She does, however, have a significant accentuate curve of Spee with the incisors being 3 to 4 mm above the flat plane. In the lower arch, she has an accentuated curve of occlusion as well with the lower incisors being at least a couple of millimeters higher than the bicuspids. She has an increased curve of Wilson in the molars in the upper arch.

Basic Diagnoses
Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocations without reduction
Vertical maxillary hyperplasia
AP mandibular hypoplasia
Apertognathia
Class II end-on occlusion
Accentuated curve of occlusion, upper arch
Slight overangulation of maxillary and mandibular incisors
Hypertrophied nasal turbinates
Partial nasal airway obstruction
Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 to 4 mm (normal 11 mm)
Significant speech disorder
Lip incompetence
TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars
High occlusal plane angulation

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch in three segments:
Segment 1: Left cuspid through first molar Segment 2: Left lateral incisor through right lateral incisor
Segment 3: Right cuspid through right first molar Place a step in the arch wire so that the four incisors are aligned at an elevated plane compared to the posterior teeth. Keep the lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower incisors removing 2 mm of tooth structure and retract. Place an arch wire only back through the first molars. Place brackets on all four second molars but do not engage in the arch wire at this time

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly and level the accentuated curve of occlusion (Spee)
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies Surgical removal of impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4

B263  MRI Scan Evaluation
Date of Acquisition:	
Date of Reading: 

Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears to have lost significant vertical height. Appears somewhat narrow, but the head has a mushroom shape to it. On some views there is a decreased vertical joint space, and the bone quality on some of the views does not look really good. In fact, the condyle shows up well on only one view. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa by about 3 mm. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly positioned.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that likewise has lost significant vertical dimension. Has more of a mushroom shape to it. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 or 3 mm. Joint space is not too deficient and similar to the opposite side. Discal tissue is probably anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is quite small in size. Has definitely lost condylar volume both vertically and anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is actually fairly steep. Particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint it is quite steep and long. Disc is anteriorly dislocated and sitting beneath the articular eminence.

On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle, and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. The disc is short anteroposteriorly.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, demonstrates a condyle that has undergone significant loss of volume vertically and anteroposteriorly. Anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is extremely steep very similar to the opposite side. Appears to be some decreased superior joint space. Articular disc is anteriorly positioned and sitting beneath the articular eminence very similar to the opposite side.

On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle, and the condyle stops quite a bit short of the apex of the articular eminence. Articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. Disc is short anteroposteriorly and appears somewhat degenerated.

Impression:
Left TMJ significant condylar resorption (probably ICR) and articular disc dislocation with deformation and nonreducing
Right TMJ significant condylar resorption (probably ICR) and articular disc dislocation with deformation and nonreducing
Probable salvageable articular discs

RE:	B263 
Dear __:
Thank you so much for referring B263  for consultation. She is certainly a lovely young lady, and I enjoyed visiting with, her mother, and her aunt. B263 is 15 years old and had previous orthodontics performed from the age of 13 to 14-1/2. At the completion of her orthodontics, she had a really good bite relationship. Since that time she has developed significant retrusion of the mandible, Class II occlusion, and anterior open bite. MRI evaluation demonstrates relatively classic idiopathic condylar resorption bilaterally with subsequent retrusion of the mandible and development of an anterior open bite.

Based on clinical, radiographic, dental model, and MRI analyses, B263's diagnoses are as follows:
Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption with articular disc dislocations without reduction
Vertical maxillary hyperplasia
AP mandibular hypoplasia
Apertognathia
Class II end-on occlusion
Accentuated curve of occlusion, upper arch
Slight overangulation of maxillary and mandibular incisors
Hypertrophied nasal turbinates
Partial nasal airway obstruction
Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 to 4 mm (normal 11 mm)
Significant speech disorder
Lip incompetence
TMJ pain
Myofascial pain
Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars
High occlusal plane angulation
Recommended treatment would be as follows:

Presurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch in three segments:
Segment 1: Left cuspid through first molar Segment 2: Left lateral incisor through right lateral incisor
Segment 3: Right cuspid through right first molar Place a step in the arch wire so that the four incisors are aligned at an elevated plane compared to the posterior teeth. Keep the lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies
Align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower incisors removing 2 mm of tooth structure and retract. Place an arch wire only back through the first molars. Place brackets on all four second molars but do not engage in the arch wire at this time

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly and level the accentuated curve of occlusion (Spee)
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction
Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies Surgical removal of impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
I feel this treatment plan would get B263 the best possible functional and aesthetic result.
B263 has a significant accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch. Therefore, I have recommended that we align the teeth in segments but use a continuous wire with a vertical step in that wire. Segment 1 would be left cuspid through first molar, segment 2 left lateral incisor through right lateral incisor, and segment 3 right cuspid through right first molar.

Although it would be very helpful to have brackets on the second molars particularly at the time of surgery, do not engage the second molars in the arch wire as they could cause some significant aberrant tooth movement at this time since those are the other teeth that are in a functional occlusion. They can be engaged in the orthodontic treatment following surgery. Also, I plan to do interdental osteotomies between the upper lateral incisors and cuspids. Please be sure that the lateral incisor roots remain tipped mesially and cuspids distally to make room for these interdental bone cuts.

In the lower arch, the lower teeth are slightly overangulated. In order for us to get the best interdigitation, it would be helpful to slenderize the lower anterior teeth by removing approximately 2 mm of tooth structure and retracting the lower anteriors.

If you have any other thoughts or suggestions in reference to her treatment, please contact me. Thank you again so much for referring B263 , and I look forward to the opportunity of working with you in correcting her concerns and problems.

With best regards,
