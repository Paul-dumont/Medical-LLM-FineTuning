B006
B006 is 55 years old. Referred by Dr. XXXX.
B006's TMJ problems began at the age of 51. She yawned and heard a large cracking noise in the left jaw joint. It did not bother her at first, but within about 6 months she began developing pain. B006's primary concerns at this time involve the following:

Chronic pain in the jaw and shoulders.
Severe teeth clenching and grinding. Lower teeth have moved.
Treatment she has had to date includes splint therapy 2 years ago that actually made her condition worse. She has also had some physical therapy and pain medications. Currently, she only takes Tylenol for her pain.

B006 gets headaches one to two times per week at a level of 3 in her frontal, temporal, and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 4, diet at 3, disability at 6. She gets frequent earaches, occasional tinnitus, but no vertigo and no hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is very much aware of clenching fairly severely during the day, but is unaware of clenching at night and actually feels the best in the morning when she wakes up. When she tried the splint therapy, this apparently caused her to clench more and increased her pain levels.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B006 has fairly good left-to-right symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is a little bit off towards the right side probably about 2 or 3 mm. The maxillary midline is off to the left about 1 mm. The mandibular dental midline is off to the right about 1 mm. The chin is fairly close to being on the midline. In profile view, she has fairly good projection of the upper jaw. The mandible appears to be retruded probably about 4 or 5 mm. The chin neckline is not well defined. Intraorally, B006has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has developed a little bit of spacing around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a Class II division 2 malocclusion with a deep bite of about 5 mm. The lower two thirds of the lower third of the face appears vertically deficient. She has pain over the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, low severe pain over the retromandibular area, moderate pain over the shoulders, and milder tenderness over the medial pterygoids and SCMs. The maximal incisal opening is 32 mm, but opening without significant pain 17 mm. The excursion movement to the right is 3 mm and to the left 5 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look reasonably healthy. The uvula is quite elongated but the rest of the structures look relatively normal. Intranasally, she has a septal spur off the base of the nose on the left side. The turbinates have just mild enlargement.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The condyles appear a little bit arthritic in nature. The sinuses appear relatively clear.

Coronal view shows that there is a bone spur sticking off the left side of the nose. The septum deviates a little bit towards the left side. The turbinates are mildly enlarged particularly on the right side where it extends further towards the midline than the left turbinate extends.

Left TMJ coronal tomograms shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is decreased lateral joint space, but the rest of the joint space looks pretty good. There is a lateral protrusion at the lateral pole of the condyle.

Right TMJ coronal tomograms show good joint space.
Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has anterior beaking present. The superior joint space looks actually fairly good, although there is a slight decreased joint space anteriorly. It appears almost as though the mandible is being held forward.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some slight anterior beaking present. The condyle appears to be postured a little bit forward. The joint space appears fairly well balanced.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a Class II skeletal and a Class II occlusal relationship with a division 2 maxillary incisor position. Oropharyngeal airway appears somewhat constricted with an airway dimension of only about 3 or 4 mm at the base of the tongue area. At the soft palate, there may be space of about 4 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B006would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and degeneration of the articular discs. Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia.
Class II division 2 malocclusion.
TMJ pain. Myofascial pain. Headaches. Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm (normal AP dimension is 11 mm.
Large nasal septal spur on the left side. Chronic daytime clenching.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2.	CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
3.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction with mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.	Bilateral coronoidotomies. e.	Nasal septoplasty.
4.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

I decided to start her on some antibiotics and antiinflammatory medication. I gave her a prescription for doxycycline, dispensing 60 tablets, 1 tablet b.i.d. for 1 month and then 1 tablet q.d. after that with 2 refills. I also suggested she should take Advil 2 tablets q.i.d. to see if this helps with her inflammatory process.
