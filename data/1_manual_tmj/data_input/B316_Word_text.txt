B316 
B316 is 37 years old and referred by Dr. __. She had previous surgeries for ovarian cysts x2. She had her appendix removed and breast augmentations. B316 is in good health with no major medical problems. The only medication she takes is birth control and then she takes Excedrin for her migraine headaches as needed. She also takes ibuprofen.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
Chronic clicking and popping of the jaw joints.
Pain.
Headaches.
B316 has no earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She does clench at nighttime and daytime. She rates her TMJ pain on an average day at about 2 but can escalate to 10 and average daily facial pain and headaches are a level of 2 but can escalate to 10. She rates her jaw function at 2, diet at 6, disability at 1. Her headaches occur predominately in the frontal and temple area and also in the posterior head area at about a level of 4. They also can escalate to 10. In frontal view, B316 has good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 to 2.5 mm. Maxillary and mandibular midline could be just 1 mm off to the right. In profile view, B316 has fairly good AP and vertical facial balance. She may have some slight retrusion in both the maxilla and mandible probably related to the previous extractions she had of four first bicuspids. B316 is missing all 4 first bicuspids. She has basically a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side but a slight Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the left side by about 2 mm. Soft palate and uvula appear a little bit hypervascular. Uvula appears pretty much normal length as does the soft palate. Faucial pillars, however, are moderately constricted. This could be contributing some to her snoring pattern. To palpation, B316 has some mild to moderate tenderness over the TMJs and mild tenderness over the styloid areas. On opening, she has audible clicks and pops in both TMJs with the left opening clicking occurring about 10 mm and the right one about 15 mm. Closing clicks are between 5 and 10 mm on both sides. Maximal Incisal opening is about 46 mm. Opening without pain is about 25 mm. Excursive movement to the right is 7 mm, left 6 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars as well as all 4 first bicuspids. She has a root canal in the maxillary right first molar. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size. The condyles grossly appear intact with perhaps some minor bony changes.

Waters view show that the turbinates are moderate in size. The bony septum at least is fairly straight. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Frontal sinuses are fairly large.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of a hockey stick shape to it. Posterior joint space actually looks good but the anterosuperior joint space appears a little bit constricted. Articular eminence is moderately steep.

B316
Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit better morphology than the opposite side. Articular eminence is relatively normal inclination. Joint spaces appear a little bit better balanced in this joint. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a slight skeletal Class II occlusal and skeletal relationship. She has an overjet of about 2 mm. Oropharyngeal airway appears to be about 9 mm in AP dimension at the soft palate area and about 10 or 11 at the base of the tongue. The lateral faucial pillars can be seen to extend down into the lateral pharyngeal wall area. Maxilla and mandible appear retruded.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.
AP maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency.
Class II end-on occlusion on the left side and Class I occlusion on the right side.
Missing all 4 first bicuspids and all 4 third molars.
Constricture of the faucial pillars. TMJ pain.
Myofascial pain.
Headaches.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics.
Align and level maxillary arch.
Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla.
Consider UPPP procedure to reconstruct the posterior fascial pillars.
Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B316 EVALUATION : 37/F
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Decreased lateral joint space. The disc appears to be medially displaced. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of only about 1 mm. Condylar head extends almost beyond the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology but has more of a downward slant from the medial pole to the lateral pole compared to the opposite side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. There appears to be fairly good joint space vertically. However, there could be some decreased joint space towards the lateral aspect. The discs may be medially displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology with some flattening on the anterior head with a little bit of peaking at the top of the condyle. A little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep and somewhat elongated. The disc is anteriorly displaced particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint and medially displaced. The disc is not as evident laterally as it is medially. Towards the medial aspect the disc is actually in better position so it is actually a rotational factor occurring within the joint. Some fatty deposition in the articular eminence. On opening, there is reduction of the articular disc and good translation.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some anterior beaking present. Little osteophyte sticking off the superior head of the condyle perhaps. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint whereas at the medial aspect the disc appears to be in a better position. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space and inferior joint space. There may be some inflammation in the retro-discal area or some fat deposition. On opening, there appears to be early reduction with good translation of the articular disc and condyle.

IMPRESSION: Left TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint with early reduction and good translation. Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint with early reduction on opening.
