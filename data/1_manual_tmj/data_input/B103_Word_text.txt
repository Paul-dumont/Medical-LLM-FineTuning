B103
B103 is 34 years old and is a self-referral. B103 had an onset of her TMJ problems at the age of 14 probably related to AICR. She did have an accident of age of 7 on a diving board where she hit the underneath of her chin and damaged some of her primary teeth. She had orthodontics from the age of 11 to 12 and then again from the age of 14 to 15. She had her third molars removed at the age of 15. At the age of 16, she had double jaw surgery by Dr. XXXX. That same year she also had a nasal septoplasty and an external rhinoplasty. She has been in splint therapy for 14 years and estimates she has had 20 to 30 splints. Following completion of her orthodontics, her bite did open again. After the surgery, the bite opened once again. B103 rates her headaches at a level of 7 that occur in the temporal areas bilaterally. They occur at a rate of two times per day. She wakes up with the headaches and then in the afternoon around 5 o'clock the headaches begin again. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 2, diet at 3, disability at 7. She gets occasional earaches, gets tinnitus about 2 times per week, but has no vertigo or known hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her wrists and her neck. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime. She takes the following medications:

Lexapro 10 mg q.d.
Advil 1200 mg p.r.n.
In frontal view, B103 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip is 20 mm in length and upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm on the left and 2.5 on the right. The maxillary midline is about 1 mm off to the right side. The nasal tip is about 1 mm off to the left side. The chin is about 2 mm off to the left side. In profile, the maxilla is retruded about 4 to 5 mm and the chin is retruded about 10 to 12 mm. The chin neckline is short and chin neck angle is not defined. Intraorally, B103 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has adequate attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has got crowns in the maxillary left first molar and right first and second molars. She is fairly close to a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. There is some mild crowding in the lower arch. She has a 2 mm anterior deep bite. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and normal with the soft palate appearing maybe a little bit elongated with a deep crease dimension perhaps from the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size and the septum appears reasonably straight. There appears to be good nasal airway. To palpation, she has some moderate discomfort over the TMJs and milder tenderness over the temporalis, masseters, medial pterygoids, and SCMs. The maximal incisal opening is 47 mm but 25 mm without discomfort. Excursion movements to the right is 9 mm, to the left 8 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars. There are four bone plates in each side, but each bone plate only has two screws with one screw above and one screw below the osteotomy site. There are two screws in the left ramus, but none in the right ramus but apparently these were removed. She has two screws in the chin area. She had root canals on the maxillary left second bicuspid, right cuspid, first bicuspid, and mandibular right cuspid and left first molar. She has crowns on the maxillary right first and second molars, mandibular left first and second molars, and maxillary left first molar. The condyles appear arthritic.

Coronal view shows that the septum is reasonably straight and turbinates are relatively normal in size. The sinuses appear clear.
Axial view shows that the septum has a little deviation off towards the right side. The turbinates are relatively normal in size and the sinuses appear clear.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show condyles that have undergone significant resorption with loss of vertical and anteroposterior volume. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. There is decreased joint space more towards the lateral aspect of the joint. There are some pseudocysts in the head of the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that has undergone significant condylar resorption with loss of vertical and anteroposterior volume. There are some pseudocysts in the head of the condyle. The articular eminences are just slightly steeper on this side but are still moderately shallow. The condyle is positioned somewhat posterior in the fossa.

Left TMJ coronal view shows that there is significant loss of vertical volume and mediolateral width of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 5 mm. There is decreased vertical joint space particularly towards the medial side of the joint.

Right coronal view shows a condyle that has lost significant vertical volume and mediolateral volume and may be a little bit more narrow than the opposite side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 5 to 6 mm extending down beyond the head of the condyle. There is somewhat decreased vertical joint space.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a Class I occlusal relationship, but probably a slight Class II skeletal relationship. She has a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway measures 4 mm at the soft palate level and about 6 mm at the base of the tongue.

Basic diagnoses for B103 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis (AICR).
Maxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia. Class I occlusion.
Moderate crowding of the lower anterior arch.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway.
Sleep apnea. Bilateral TMJ pain. Headaches.
Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level the maxillary arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).
3. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to down graft the posterior aspect and advance in a counterclockwise direction. c.	Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.	Bilateral coronoidotomies.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B103 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view show a condyle that is very narrow in mediolateral width and has lost significant vertical volume. There is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim appears to curve inferiorly 5 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle is very narrow mediolaterally and has lost vertical volume. The lateral rim of the fossa appears to curve inferiorly about 4 mm. There is decreased superior joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is somewhat narrow anteroposteriorly. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. The disc is significantly deformed and degenerated. The condyle is sitting posterior and superiorly in the fossa with decreased joint spaces. The anterior joint space is increased. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction with significant deformation.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is arthritic with some sclerosis in the ________ portion of the head of the condyle. There is some anterior beaking present. There is decreased superior joint space. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence and appears significantly deformed and degenerated. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, but the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction with significant deformation.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction with severe deformation and degeneration. Discs appear non-salvageable. Patient probably a candidate for total joint prostheses.
