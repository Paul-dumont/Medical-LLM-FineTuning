B487 
B487 is 9 years old. Referred by Dr. XX. Primary concerns for B487 is that:

His jaw may be growing differently on the left side compared to the right side.
He manipulates his jaw to try to crack the joints at least 10 times per day.

B487 has no trouble with headaches. He rates his TMJ pain at 2, but on the average day he does not have any significant pain. He rates his jaw function, diet, and disability at 0. The onset of his TMJ problems are at the age of 9 years of unknown etiology. He takes no medications. He has no earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss and no other joints bother him. He is not aware of clenching or bruxism. Telephone conversation with XX. I talked to him about her treatment and the fact that she needs braces on the upper arch with fairly heavy wire and slenderizing the lower anterior teeth with retraction. He says that he will get on that as soon as she gets back in town and he will be gone for a week or so also. The dad would like to have the surgery done in September, but he does not think that that is feasible but perhaps not too long after that. He will let us know when she can proceed on. He agrees that we do not need to do the extractions.

In frontal view, he appears to have good facial symmetry. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, he appears to have good facial balance. Intraorally, he has got his primary C's, D's, and E's in place yet and the first molars and four incisors are in position. He appears to have adequate attached gingiva. There appears to be no crowding present. In the upper jaw, he has C's, D's, E's in position, but has his 4 incisors and his second molars erupted in. He is basically a Class I cuspid relationship. He has some significant wear on the primary teeth with there being almost a slight open bite in the left side between the C's, D's and E's. He has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. He does have a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 2 mm shorter vertically than the left side in the cuspid area. He has about a 2 mm anterior over bite. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. The tonsils are moderately enlarged. To palpation, he has some mild tenderness over the TMJs. On opening, joints seem to function reasonably smoothly. On excursion movements, he has audible pops and crepitus sounds. The maximal incisal opening is 45 mm and excursion movements are about 11 mm in each direction. B487 did have an adenoidectomy 4 years ago.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the development of all 4 second molars, all 8 bicuspids, and all 4 cuspids. All 3 incisors are erupted in as well as four of the 6-year molars.

Coronal view shows turbinates are enlarged particularly on the left side and appears to be pretty much elimination of the airway space on the left side. The sinuses are small but clear. The septum appears reasonably straight.
Axial view shows that the septum is reasonably straight. Both turbinates are large, but the left one is the largest.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the anterior head. The articular eminence is fairly shallow. There appears to be some anterior beaking present. The joint space appears reasonably good, although the condyle appears postured forward some.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a little bit of anterior beaking that has developed. Overall joint space looks pretty well balanced.
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears flattened across the top as though there may have been some resorption. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is increased upper joint space. The condyle may be just slightly narrow mediolaterally.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows he has his mandible postured forward a little bit for this x-rays so he is almost end-on and he actually has about 2 mm overbite relationship. Posterior teeth are apart, but again I believe this is due to some slight forward posturing of the lower jaw.

Diagnoses for B487 would be as follows:
Rule out TMJ articular disc dislocation.
Facial asymmetry with the right side being shorter in vertical height than the left side.
Chin shifted to the right side about 2 mm. Nose shifted a little bit to the right side about 1 to 2 mm. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 2 mm higher vertically than the left side. History of dystonic mandibular movement that he does at least 10 times a day of shifting his jaw side to side.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
MRI of left and right TMJ.
Continue to monitor facial growth and development.

DATE OF INTERPRETATION:	 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width, although a little bit flattened on top. It appears that there is discal tissue in position. It could be just slightly medially displaced. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 1 to 2 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that may be a little flat on top with a little downward slope to mid coronal area towards the lateral pole. It appears there is discal tissue in position. The joint space is greater on this side compared to the opposite side. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view is not good quality. There is fluid in the superior joint space. It is difficult to tell where the disc is in this view. The articular eminence appears fairly long in length and has a moderate slope to it.

The right side is non-readable.
On the left side in another image, the disc appears to be in position. The articular eminence is more shallow than in the previous image that was not very readable. At the lateral aspect of the joint, it is possible the disc might be a little bit anteriorly displaced.

Right TMJ shows that there appears to be a little bit of dent in the head of the condyle, but again difficult to tell because of the poor imaging. The disc appears that it is in position. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.

Left TMJ on opening, there is some limited translation; however, the disc appears to be in position at this particular depth of the cut. There does appear to be a little bit of fluid in the inferior joint space.

On right TMJ, it appears that there is a little bit of an anterior beaking on the condyle. The disc appears to be in position. There is slightly better translation on this side than the opposite side.

IMPRESSION: Possible slight anterior displacement of the disc at the lateral aspect of the joint on the left side. Otherwise, joints are reasonably unremarkable.
