B131
B131 is 25 years old and referred by XXXX and Dr. XXXX. B131 has a long history of airway problems and has had previous tonsils and adenoids removed and also has had a deviated septal repair; however, he continues to have significant breathing problems. He had orthodontics at the age of 17 to 18 and then had appliances replaced. During his first orthodontic round, he had palatal expansion attempted, but apparently the device kept breaking. He developed some TMJ clicking and popping of unknown etiology at about the age of 22. B131 gets headaches once or twice a week at about a level of 2 in the temporal area. However, he claims no TMJ pain and on the average day does not have any significant pain problems. He rates his jaw function, diet, and disability at 0. He takes Allegra as needed for allergies. He has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother him. He is aware of bruxism at nighttime. He has had a sleep study and it shows that he does have sleep apnea. In addition, he has extreme difficulties eating and chewing and keeping his lips together.

In frontal view, B131 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is 22 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 5.5 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is deviated off to the right side about 3 mm. The left eye is just slightly higher than the right eye 1 to 2 mm. In profile view, B131 has some prominence of the nasal dorsum. He has nasal tip ptosis. He has an acute nasolabial angle, although the maxilla is significantly AP deficient. The mandible is probably about 25 mm AP deficient. B131 does have a neck postured forward head position. The lower third face appears elongated. He does have eversion of the lower lip. The lower third face is elongated. Chin neckline is short, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. In the lower arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has a power chain on the lower arch. He has a space between the lower central incisors. Gingiva is hyperplastic and somewhat inflamed. In upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has a power chain on the upper arch as well. The upper teeth appear to be vertically inclined. He has a slight Class III cuspid relationship on the right side of about 1 to 2 mm, but on the left side he is basically Class I. The lower dental midline may be 1 mm off towards the left side. He has an end-on incisor relationship. The chin transversely appears wide. Transversely, the occlusal plane appears to be fairly level. Lateral palpebral ligaments are inferiorly positioned probably 2 to 3 mm. B131 has an extremely high arched palate. Oropharyngeal tissues (uvula, soft palate, fascial pillars, etc.) look reasonably healthy and free of disease. Intranasally, it is hard to evaluate, but it appears that the turbinates are enlarged. The septum may be a little bit over towards the left side. He has moderate nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, he has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, the left joint functions smoothly, but on the right side, he has a glitch consistently at about 15 to 20 mm of opening, but does seem as though it is related to a disc displacement. The incisal opening is 47 mm, excursion movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 7 mm. Apparently, B131 previously had some polyps removed from his sinuses.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars but the rest of the teeth are present.
Coronal view shows that the sinuses are relatively clear with just some slight thickening of the sinus membrane on the floor of the right sinus. The left turbinate appears enlarged and appears to be blocking the airway. The right side does not appear to be quite as large.

Axial view shows the sinuses are clear. The turbinates are moderately enlarged and the septum is deviated anteriorly off towards the right side and a little bit towards the left side in the mid nasal area. There does not appear to be a significant airway passage, but it is greater on the right side as compared to the left side.

Left TMJ sagittal tomogram shows that there appears to be decreased vertical joint space. There is a little bit of flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and some slight tendency towards anterior beaking. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The joint space is decreased vertically as well as posteriorly.

Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that has some slight anterior beaking tendencies. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space, not quite to the degree as the opposite side.

Left TMJ coronal view shows there is significantly decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably at least 4 mm over the lateral aspect of the condyle. There is decreased superior and lateral joint space.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is significantly larger than the left side. There is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 4 to 5 mm.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B131 has a significantly retruded maxilla and mandible. Oropharyngeal airway space is decreased to 5.5 mm at the base of the tongue (normal dimension is 11 mm), but it significantly closes down more when sleeping. Tongue is in the inferior position relative to the height of the palate. He has a high occlusal plane angle. Vertical height of the mandible is extremely long.

Basic diagnoses for B131 would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation (needs to be confirmed by MRI).
Maxillary AP and transverse hypoplasia but anterior vertical hyperplasia.
Mandibular AP hypoplasia, but anterior vertical hyperplasia.
High occlusal plane angle.
Decreased oropharyngeal airway (50% of the normal dimension).
Sleep apnea.
Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. External nasal deformity.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. MRI of TMJs to determine TMJ pathology.
2. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Remove power chain from the maxilla. Open slight spacing between the upper lateral incisors and cuspids. b.	Continue to align and level mandibular arch.
3. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ surgery for disc repositioning with ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction, advancing it about 16 mm. c.	Maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly 4 mm and advance it forward 10 mm. d.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to decrease the height of the mandible and augment it at the anterior. e.	Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. f.	External rhinoplasty.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B131 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. There is significantly decreased vertical joint space. There appears to be discal tissue medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 4 to 5 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite large and perhaps slightly larger than the opposite side. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm. There is significantly decreased lateral joint space.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is flattened on top. The articular eminence is relatively flat. The disc is anteriorly displaced. There is decreased vertical and posterior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. The condylar head and neck appears long on this side. The articular eminence is moderately flat. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

I find it very difficult to read this MRI. I need to meet with Dr. XXXX. The radiologist read it as both joints being arthritic and having displaced discs that reduced, being worse on the left side than the right side.
