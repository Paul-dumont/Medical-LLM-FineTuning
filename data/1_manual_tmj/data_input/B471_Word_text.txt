B471
B471 is 39 years old and referred by Dr. XX.
Patient History
She has had a history of bronchitis in the past and has had a tonsillectomy.

B471  is in good health except for the jaw problems.
Current Medications
She currently takes the following medications:
Tylenol.
Advil.
She takes those medications for jaw joint pain.

Patient Concerns
Primary concerns that B471 has include the following:
Headaches.
TMJ pain.
Extreme difficulties eating and chewing.
Pain in the muscles.
Snoring.
Difficulties sleeping on her back.
Teeth and jaws don't fit together very well.

Of interest is that her father has to sleep with a CPAP machine.
B471's problems began in her teenage years of unknown etiology, probably associated with idiopathic condylar resorption. She was treated with bite splints in high school because of severe clenching and bruxism. She also had orthodontics as a teenager and had upper first bicuspids extracted to retract the upper teeth to the lower teeth. By history, her father and her grandfather also have retruded lower jaws. She is not aware of her lower jaw retrusion becoming any worse currently. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, but does get occasional vertigo. She does have scoliosis, but she doesn't have any joint problems per se where there is any functional or pain problem associated with them except for the TMJs. She still continues to have some nocturnal clenching and bruxism but not as significant as it was earlier. She gets headaches predominantly in the temporal area bilaterally and rates them at about a level of 5, TMJ pain at 5, overall pain at 5, jaw function and diet at 6, and disability at 7.

Clinical Evaluation
In frontal view, B471 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Some asymmetry in the position of the mandible. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is 5 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted 3 mm off to the right. Chin is 5 mm off to the right. Right side of the mandible is probably at least 4 to 5 mm shorter than the left side.

In profile view, B471 has some significant AP maxillary deficiency of probably 6 to 8 mm. She is probably 20 mm AP deficient. B471 has an obtuse nasolabial angle. There is no chin-neckline or chin-neck angle. Dorsum of nose appears to be in good balance with the cheeks and forehead. Upper lip supralabrale is retruded probably 3 to 4 mm relative to subnasale.

Intraorally, B471 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. They appear to be nicely aligned and leveled. She has really thin attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch but may be adequate. It is very thin particularly around the right central incisor. In the upper arch, she is missing the first bicuspids. Upper arch has been set up segmentally with the four incisors aligned in a segment and each of the posterior quadrants lined up separately. She has a Class II skeletal relationship and occlusal relationship. She hits end-on on the right cuspid and actually has a crossbite on the right side of the jaw. Left side has a tendency towards crossbite posteriorly. Anteriorly she has probably a 3- to 4-mm anterior open bite. Probably Class II by 5 mm on the right side and 3 mm on the left side. Transversely, the right cuspid is down about a millimeter more than the left cuspid is but maybe just due to some extrusion. Transversely, in the lower arch, the right side is 2 mm higher than the left side. Currently, in centric relation, she occludes only on her right cuspid teeth; all other teeth are out of occlusion. Intraorally, oropharynx appears clear. Uvula is hyperplastic. Soft palate, however, appears to have a wide width to it and a wide distance between the posterior faucial pillars, which appear to insert more into the lateral wall of the pharynx than directly into the posterior wall. In the lower arch, the left cuspid is about 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, the right cuspid is about a millimeter posterior to the left cuspid.

Intranasally, the turbinates appear fairly large. The nostrils are a little bit constricted but not too badly. The luminal valves, particularly on the right side, create quite a constricture. Holding the luminal valves open significantly improved her abilities to breathe through her nose.

Joints seem to function fairly smoothly. On excursive movement, occasionally there would be a click-type noise in the right TMJ. To palpation, she has some mild to moderate pain in the temporalis, masseters, TMJ styloid areas, and right medial pterygoid area. Maximal incisal opening eliminating the open bite is about 30 mm and without significant discomfort 25 mm. Excursive movement to the right was difficult for her, but she could achieve about 5 mm and to the left side about 7 mm. Lower dental midline and chin midline are fairly well aligned with each other.

Radiographic Evaluation
Panorex shows the absence of all four first bicuspids and all four third molars. Sinuses appear clear. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged. Appears to be a septal spur coming off the septum on the right side. Left condyle appears as though it has undergone some degenerative changes, and there is some anterior beaking present. Left condyle looks extremely small, and the condylar neck is even extremely thin indicative of probably previous condylar resorptive problems.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle sitting posteriorly in the fossa with decreased superior and posterior joint space. Anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is fairly shallow. Condyle has moderate anteroposterior width.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is fairly small in size vertically and anteroposteriorly. Some anterior beaking is present. Condyle is positioned almost right up against the posterior wall of the fossa. The AP width of the ramus and vertical height of the mandibular posterior body appears to be small compared to normal.

Opening views show moderately good translation of both joints, however, clinically there is no reduction of the articular discs.
Waters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Mandible is foreshortened on the right side considerably compared to the left side by probably 5 to 6 mm. Mandibular dental midline is seen shifted off towards the left side. Nasal airway looks fairly clogged. Frontal sinuses are quite large being significantly larger on the left side than the right side.

Cephalometrically, B471 has some slight vertical maxillary excess but AP maxillary deficiency and AP mandibular deficiency. There is a high occlusal plane angle facial type. She said she has an open bite all throughout the occlusion except for premature contacts on the left cuspids. Oropharyngeal airway shows significant constricture with the width at the soft palate level being only about 4 mm, at the base of the tongue just below the soft palate 3.5 mm, and further down at the base of the tongue about 2.5 mm (normal 11 mm). Interestingly, the inferior border and the occlusal planes appear to line up fairly equally.

Tooth-size analysis reveals no significant evidence of tooth-size discrepancy. However, the lingual labial width of the incisors appears somewhat broader than normal, and, therefore, there could be a slight discrepancy.

Recommended Treatment
Presurgical orthodontics
Continue to align and level maxillary arch.
Continue to align and level mandibular arch.

Surgery
Bilateral TMJ condylectomies, debridement, reconstruction, and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.
Fat grafts, bilateral TMJs.
Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it, downgraft it posteriorly, and expand it with bone plate stabilization and hydroxyapatite grafting.
Uvulectomy.
Partial turbinectomies.

Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion
B471 MRI Evaluation  
Left TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly quite significantly. There appears to be significant discal tissue medially. Cortical bone in the fossa and condyle appears to be intact. There appears to be decreased lateral joint space on some of the views.

Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is quite small in size mediolaterally and perhaps a third of the volume of a normal condyle. Some evidence of some discal tissue medially but not very well defined. Evidence of probable previous condylar resorption. Lateral rim of the fossa curves severely inferiorly, being almost 6 mm lower than the depth of the fossa. On the left side, the lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly only about 4 mm compared to the roof of the fossa. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically, although there is some space there.

Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some significant anterior beaking present. Decreased joint space vertically. Articular eminence is long with a gentle slope. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting along the posterior slope of the articular eminence. Discal tissue not well visualized out laterally. There is some joint fluid in the superior joint space. There is restricted translation of the condyle on opening and no evidence of reduction of the disc.

Right TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is very small anteroposteriorly and vertically. There is fairly good size anterior beaking present medially. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Disc is foreshortened and significantly deformed. The slope of the eminence of fairly long and slightly steeper than the opposite side. There is fluid in the superior joint space. Cortical bone appears to be intact in the joint structures.

On opening, there is some restriction in translation, although it is better than the opposite side. Disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.

Impression:
Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced with significant decreased transitory mobility of the condyle and nonreducing disc.
Right TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and significant discal deformation.
Rule out idiopathic condylar resorption, reactive arthritis, or other pathological process causing the condylar resorption in the right TMJ.
