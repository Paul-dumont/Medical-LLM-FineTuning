B164
B164 is 60 years old. B164 is in good health. She takes vitamins and a baby aspirin. B164's problems began last year. The etiology is unknown except she feels it could be related to the dental implants that were placed about 2 years prior by Dr. XXXX. The implants got infected and she was treated with antibiotics.

Treatment so far has consisted basically of a nighttime splint that was constructed seven months ago. This has helped the pain some. Her pain is generally worsen in the mornings and tends to go away within a couple of hours or so. She gets headaches at about a level of 3 in the temporal area that used to occur daily, but she has really not had a significant headache in the past 3 weeks. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 1, diet at 5, and disability at 1. She gets left-sided earaches and occasionally right-sided ones as well. She gets frequent tinnitus but has no vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her left knee, left shoulder, and lower back. She is aware of clenching at nighttime.

B164 has good facial balance and symmetry. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molar on the right side and third molar on the left side except the left second molar and first molar have been replaced by implants. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some crowns on all four right-sided molars and in the mandibular arch in the first and second molar. She has basically a Class I cuspid relationship on the right side and slight Class II cuspid relationship on the left side by probably 2 mm. She has an anterior deep bite of probably about 3 mm. The mandibular dental midline is shifted about 1 mm to the left. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size with the right one maybe slightly enlarged. She gives no history of snoring, but has moderate daytime somnolence and has probably a moderate sleep disorder. She wakes up at night and is unable to go back to sleep. She has significant hearing loss in her right ear. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening though, she has noises in both joints with opening clicks at probably around 25 to 30 mm and closing click is probably 15 to 20 mm. The incisal opening is about 50 mm and excursion movements are about 12 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows missing mandibular left second bicuspid, first molar replaced by implants. There is a root canal on the left mandibular first bicuspid as well as the second molar. The third molar is retained on that side. She has crowns on the posterior teeth on the mandibular left side extended from the first bicuspid through the second molar. On the right side, she has crowns on all four molars and is missing the third molars. The sinuses look relatively clear. The right turbinate appears enlarged compared to the left one.

Coronal view shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates are moderately enlarged, but the septum appears relatively straight.
Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear and the septum is straight. The turbinates have a mild size increase.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the anterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking present but not too much. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. The articular eminence has a moderate steepness, although not very long in length. There is definite increased anterior joint space and has a significantly decreased posterior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal view tomograms show a condyle that has perhaps a little bit of a tendency towards anterior beaking in some views. The articular eminence is moderately steep, but not quite as steep as the opposite side. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with an increased anterior and anterior superior joint space.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that fairly good mediolateral width. There is maybe some mild degenerative changes on the head of the condyle with some areas of sclerosis and some smaller areas of erosion. There is a little osteophytic growth off the lateral pole of the condyle. Joint space may be a little bit narrowed.

Right TMJ coronal tomograms show a bond with good mediolateral width and bone structure actually looks a little bit healthier than the opposite side. There may be some decreased lateral joint space.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B164 has good skeletal and occlusal jaw relationship. The oropharyngeal airway looks normal.
Basic diagnoses for B164 would be as follows:

Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation.
Mandibular hyperplasia.
TMJ pain. Headaches.
Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Align and level maxillary arch. b.	Align and level mandibular arch.
2. Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain the occlusion and allow the condyles to move down and forward to accommodate the articular discs.
3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
