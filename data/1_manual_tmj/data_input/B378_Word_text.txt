B378 
B378 is 16 years old and is referred by Dr. _. B378's jaw joint problems began about 2 years ago of unknown etiology. He had orthodontics at the age of 10 and had a palatal expander at the age of 4. He has had myofunctional therapy and some tongue thrust therapy as well. B378 gets headaches at about a level of 5 in the frontal, temporal and then on top of the head areas. He rates his TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 1, jaw function and diet at 5, disability at 3. B378 was in orthodontic appliances from about the age of 10 through the age of 14.

When B378 lies on his back he sometimes has difficulty breathing and also some difficulty swallowing. Sometimes during the day also when he is up particularly like if he is driving and he is turning his head to look behind him, he can develop difficulties breathing.

In frontal view, B378 has some asymmetry in the nasal structures. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm. The right eye may be just slightly elevated 1 to 2 mm compared to the left one. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is probably about 5 mm off towards the right side. Mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm to the right side. Chin is fairly close to being on the facial midline. In profile view, B378 has prominence of the nasal dorsum. He has some slight AP deficiency of maybe 2 to 3 mm. Chin appears to be retruded by probably about 15 to 18 mm. Chin-neckline is short although the chin-neck angle is reasonably well defined. He does have some definite prominence of the nasal dorsum. Intraorally, B378 appears to have all of his lower teeth back to the second molars and also the upper teeth back through the second molars. I do not see any maxillary third molars but he does have a developing mandibular left third molar but no developing right third molar. In the lower jaw, the arch is quite asymmetric with the right cuspid being about 3 mm posterior to the left cuspid. Midline of the mandibular right central incisor appears to be in line with the chin. He appears to have a full Class II cuspid relationship on the right side. He is fairly close to being Class I on the right side. He has about a 2 mm vertical overbite relationship. Oropharyngeal area looks relatively normal as does the uvula, soft palate, faucial pillars and tonsils. Intranasally, B378 has a significantly deviated septum with it being tipped off to the right side at the superior aspect, but at the base the septum it is tipped off to the left side. He has a fairly large spur from the septum on the left side that is actually touching against the turbinate on the left side. The right turbinate is quite hyperplastic whereas the left one is moderate hyperplastic but he probably has more nasal airway obstruction on the left because of the septal spurring. To palpation, he has some mild to moderate tenderness over the TMJs, left medial pterygoid, left masseter and bilateral styloid areas. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is 44 mm. Excursive movements are about 6 mm in each direction. On B378's right side he has an open bite posteriorly and he may have only an occlusion on the maxillary right second bicuspid, lower first bicuspid. He also has crossbites in the molar areas bilaterally.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
:
Panorex shows the presences of the mandibular third molars and perhaps some beginning development of the maxillary third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear.

 
Waters view shows that there is a deviation in the bony nasal septum and turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The sinuses look relatively clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has sort of a hockey stick shape to it. It appears to be a little bit decreased in vertical volume. Articular eminence is fairly steep.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that also appears to be a little bit flat on top. There appears to be almost increased vertical joint space. Articular eminence is fairly steep. On opening, there is moderately good translation of both condyles.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B378 has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway particularly at the base of the tongue measures about 8 mm but at the soft palate level it measures about 12 mm. Prominence of the nasal dorsum is noted.

B378's diagnoses is as follows:
Rule out TMJ pathology ( shows articular discs in place, but possible reactive tissue present).
AP maxillary deficiency.
Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.
AP mandibular deficiency. AP microgenia. Class II occlusion on the right side and Class I occlusion on the left side.
Arch asymmetry with mandibular dental midline being shifted off towards the right side. Mandibular right cuspid may be 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. Probable tooth size discrepancy with small upper lateral incisors.
Open bite on the right side. Impacted wisdom tooth or teeth in the mandible. Nasal septal deviation. Hypertrophied turbinates. Difficulties breathing through the nose. Nasal asymmetry with it being shifted significantly towards the right side. Transverse cant in the occlusion with the left side being lower than the right side. Over-angulation of lower incisors.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT: Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Expand the arch transversely some and open up 1 mm of space around each upper lateral incisor. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies.
Align and level mandibular arch. Consider slenderizing the lower anterior teeth and removing 1 to 2 mm of tooth structure and retract to help decrease the significant over-angulation of the lower incisors.

 
Surgery.
Perform any indicated TMJ surgery.
Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward, downgraft it posteriorly and level transversely.
Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward in a counterclockwise direction.
Augmentation genioplasty.
Removal of impacted third molar(s)
Bilateral inferior nasal turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty if indicated.
External rhinoplasty.
Post surgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B378  Evaluation Age: 16
DOB:
Date of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears abnormal. It is difficult to tell if the cortical plate is intact. It appears there may be some discal tissue medially displaced. There appears to be some decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with a downward curvature of perhaps a couple of mm. The lateral pole of the condyle appears to expand lateral to the lateral rim of the fossa.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears similar in size to the opposite side. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The disc appears to be medial and perhaps anteriorly displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat similar to the opposite side. It curves inferiorly 1 to 2 mm.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit pointed and blunted at the anterosuperior aspect of the condyle particularly towards the medial side. There appears to be some significant flattening on the posterior head of the condyle. Articular disc appears to be in position. The joint space almost appears to be excessive. It appears there may be some fluid or tissue in the superior joint space and there appears to be increased soft tissue between the disc and condyle in the lower joint space. Articular eminence is fairly steep. On opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle and the articular disc appears to translate with the condyle in a reduced position. There appears to be some additional tissue between the disc and the condyle.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears flattened on top. There appears to be an increased vertical joint space. Articular disc appears to be in position. There may be some tissue superior and inferior to the disc. Articular eminence is fairly steep. There appears be fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening there appears to be reasonable translation of the condyle and the articular disc appears to move with the condyle in a reduced position.

IMPRESSION: Mild TMJ arthritis with both articular discs in position but with possible reactive tissue surrounding the discs.
Possible reactive arthritis.
