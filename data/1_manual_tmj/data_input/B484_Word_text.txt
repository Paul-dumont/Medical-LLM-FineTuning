B484 
B484 is 31 years old and is a self-referral. By history, B484's joint problems began 10 years ago when he was about 22 years old. He had his wisdom teeth removed 9 years ago and this exacerbated his joint symptoms. He developed chronic headaches, TMJ pain, popping, constant pressure in the ears, tinnitus, etc. He saw an orthodontist, Dr. XX. He began orthodontic treatment about 7 years ago and finished 4 years ago. 5 years ago, he had maxillary and mandibular osteotomies by Dr. XX. 3 years ago, he received a splint. 2 years ago, the mandibular bone plates were removed bilaterally. From 3 to 1 year ago, he has been on numerous medications including Skelaxin, amitriptyline, Valium, etc., and had Botox injections last year. Up through this year, he has had clicking and popping in his joints, but this apparently has subsided within the last couple of months. B484 states that his headaches are at a level of 8 in predominantly the frontal and temporal areas. He rates his TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 7, diet at 3, and disability at 8. He has no earaches, but has frequent tinnitus and vertigo. No other joints bother him. He is aware of clenching his teeth at night.

In frontal view, B484 has fairly good facial symmetry with a little bit more fullness in the right mandibular area of probably 3 to 4 mm. Upper lip length is about 21 to 22 mm and upper tooth lip relationship is about -1. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are in acceptable alignment with the facial midline. Profile view shows some fairly nice facial balance. Intraorally, he is missing the mandibular right second bicuspid and left second bicuspid. The rest of the teeth are fairly well aligned and leveled. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He is close to being a Class I cuspid relationship but has a cross bite tendency posteriorly on the left side, and there is a Class III molar relationship because of the missing lower bicuspids. He has about a 1.5 mm vertical overbite. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. B484 feels as if he does not have as much freeway space between his teeth as he used to have. Sometimes when he talks and so forth, his teeth hit and he has a tendency at times to bite his lip and cheek area. The maximum incisal opening is about 51 mm, opening without discomfort 26 mm. The excursion movement to the right was 2.5 mm, to the left about 4 mm. B484 states that the headaches he gets occur predominantly around the eyes and he points to the infraorbital areas and all the periorbital areas and above the eyeball but below the frontal bone. On opening, he has got a soft click at about 35 mm in the left joint and about 30 mm on closing. On the right side, he has got some glitches in the joint. B484 will occasionally have a fairly loud audible pop in the left joint on wide opening and getting up to about 40 to 45 mm. When B484 opens and closes his jaws, the mandible shifts back and forth from side to side, more obvious in the closing pattern than the opening. Intranasally, the turbinates appear moderately enlarged and the septum is deviated off to the right side.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars and bilateral mandibular second bicuspids. All the rest of the teeth are present. He has four bone plates in the maxilla with four bone screws in each plate. The sinuses look reasonably clear. It is difficult to evaluate the joints.

Coronal view shows that he has got a little thickening of the sinus membrane in the floor of the right sinus. The turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum in the bony area curves slightly off to the right side.

Axial view shows the turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum deviates significantly off towards the right side. There is some thickening of the sinus membrane on the anterior wall of the sinus. Bone plates are evident.

Left TMJ sagittal tomograms show a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is a little bit of sclerosis on top and there are some minor changes. The condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There are some bumps in the articular eminence morphology. There is decreased posterior joint space but slight increase in anterior joint space.

Right TMJ sagittal tomograms show that there is anterior beaking present. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The condyle appears to be a little bit more arthritic on this side than the other side.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has adequate mediolateral width, but is somewhat narrower than the opposite side. Vertical joint space is somewhat decreased. The lateral rim of the fossa curves probably about 3 to 4 mm.

Right TMJ coronal views show a condyle that is large than the opposite side vertically as well as mediolaterally. There is decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint and the lateral aspect of the superior joint area. This would be indicative of a medial displaced articular disc. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm or so.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B484 has an acceptable facial balance. Oropharyngeal airway looks well within normal range.
Basic diagnoses for B484 would be as follows:

Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and laterally displaced.
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced with adhesions to the articular eminence. Mandibular hyperplasia. TMJ pain.
Headaches.
Myofascial pain.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1.	Presurgical orthodontics: Apply maxillary and mandibular appliances.
2.	Surgery. a.	Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies.
3.	Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

B484 MR 
AGE:	31/M
DOB:	 
DATE OF ACQUISITION: 
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. There is decreased vertical joint space. The articular disc is seen to be laterally and anteriorly displaced.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little flattening on the posterior head with a little tendency to form some anterior beaking but not too significant yet. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. On opening, there appears to be early reduction with good translation of the condyle and the articular disc. There is fluid in the superior joint space. Reduction occurs early in the opening process.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There is decreased vertical joint space. On this side, it appears that the disc is medially and anteriorly displaced.

Right side sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology with a little flattening on the posterior aspect of the condyle and there is a tendency towards anterior beaking. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. There is decreased superior and posterior joint spaces. On opening, there appears to be reduction of the articular disc and some restricted translation of the condyle. The disc may be adhesed to the fossa.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ articular disc anteriorly displaced with early reduction but subsequent reasonably good translation. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with adhesions to the fossa but with relatively early reduction.
