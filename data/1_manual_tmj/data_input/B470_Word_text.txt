B470 
B470 is 15 years old, referred by Dr. XX. B470  is in good health with no major medical problems. He takes no medications. He has had an adverse reaction to erythromycin. B470 does not have any problems with headaches. He gets some TMJ pain at about a level of 3. Average daily pain may be about a level of 3. Jaw function is at 2, diet is at 2, and disability is at 1. B470 is not aware of any problems with snoring, but does have some mild daytime somnolence. He states he does not have any sleep apnea problems and sleeps fairly well at night. He feels he breathes predominantly through his nose at night.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
In frontal view, B470 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3.5 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline and chin are shifted about 4 mm off towards the left side. In profile view, B470 has some significant AP maxillary deficiency with upper lip supralabrale about 3 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is a good 6 to 8 mm AP deficient. Chin appears to be about 18 to 20 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is short and chin neck angle is moderately well defined. He does have a moderate head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, B470 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. He has some diastemas around the lower anterior teeth. Cuspids appear quite small and almost peg shaped cuspids while the lower incisors look relatively normal. However, he does have spaces around the cuspids and the between the central incisors. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. The right cuspid is partially blocked out of the arch. He has a Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally. He has an anterior open bite of about 2 mm and an AP overjet of probably 4 mm. Upper lateral incisors are quite small. Transverse occlusal plane is slightly canted with the right side being a little bit lower than the left side by about 1 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues looks relatively healthy. Intranasally, the right turbinate is moderately enlarged, but the left one is more normal in size. However, there does appear to be adequate nasal airway. B470 does get bilateral clicking and popping in his joints, although the right side is worse than the left side. The right side opening click on some occasions occurred at about 20 mm of opening and almost 5 mm with closing. He will sometimes get a click on the left side at about 30 mm of opening. He has no tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is about 61 mm, excursion movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 10 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of the mandible left third molar, but the maxillary third molars bilaterally and the right third molar are present and unerupted. Sinuses look relationship clear. Left condyle appears small in size compared to the right condyle.
Waters view shows the septum is fairly straight. Right turbinate is quite large and there could possibly be a spur off the septum posterior aspect on the left-hand side. Right nasal airway appears fairly well blocked. Sinuses look relatively clear. Right TMJ tomogram is somewhat difficult to interpret. Left TMJ tomogram also is a little bit difficult to interpret. There is decreased joint space. On opening, there is moderately good translation of both joints. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows the Class II skeletal relationship and occlusion. Oropharyngeal airway is surprisingly good with an AP dimension at the soft palate level at about 8 mm. At the base of the tongue, there is an AP dimension of probably 12 mm.

Basic diagnoses for B470  would be as follows:
Bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocations with reductions.
Possible progressive condylar resorption particularly in the left joint. AP maxillary hypoplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia. Class II occlusion. Anterior open bite. Small mediolateral dimension of the mandibular cuspids. Significant crowing of the upper anterior arch particularly on the right side. Upper arch asymmetry with the right cuspid being about 2 mm anterior to the left cuspid.
Impacted maxillary third molars and mandibular right third molar.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
MRI of left and right TMJ. Restorative dentistry to place bonding on the mandibular left and right cuspids to make them a more normal width. Add about 1 ½ mm of material to each tooth
Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.
Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward, move the anterior aspect superiorly slightly, and correct any transverse discrepancy. Bilateral ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x3.
Consider reduction turbinectomy on the right side. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
Restorative dentistry to finalize the restorative work on the mandibular cuspids.

B470 MRI  
AGE: 15/M
DOB:  
Date of Acquisition:  
Date of Interpretation:  
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to be a little bit deformed and arthritic. Articular disc is medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have better bone quality than the opposite side. The articular eminence appears to be medially displaced. There appears to be decreased joint space superiorly.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little flattened on the posterior head, and there is some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately flat. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced. At the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc appears short anteroposteriorly, but more medially it appears to have a better morphology. On opening, there appears to be a late reduction of the disc. There is good translation of the condyle found beneath the articular eminence.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has better morphology. There is a little bit of flattening on the anterior head at the lateral aspect of the joint. The articular eminence is slightly steeper on this side than the opposite side. Articular eminence appears to be in position, particularly towards the medial side, but at the lateral aspect the disc is not as readily seen indicative of medial displacement. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc appears to reduce and there is good translation of the condyle and disc. Particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint, the disc may be anteriorly displaced.

IMPRESSION:
1.	Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with some deformation, but reduces on late opening.
2.	Right TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc medially displaced with perhaps some slight anterior displacement at the lateral aspect.
