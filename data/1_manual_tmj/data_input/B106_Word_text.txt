B106
B106 is 53 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B106 is in good health with no major medical problems. The only medication she takes is Angelique (mild HRT). She does not know when her joint situation began and the etiology is also unknown. She is aware of grinding noises in her joints. She gets headaches about once every 2 weeks at about a level of 2 in the temporal areas. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 0, jaw function at 3, diet at 2, disability at 2. She has no trouble with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, nor hearing loss. The only other joints that may be of concern include her neck, but she is not sure if it is a bone or a muscle problem. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime and also during the day. She had previous orthodontic treatment from ages 13 to 16. She has had appliances on now for the past 1 ½ years. Primary concerns B106 has include the following:

Teeth grinding.
Occasional headaches. Teeth do not fit together properly.
Wearing down of the teeth likely from the clenching and bruxism.
In frontal view, B106 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about -3 mm. The lower third of the face appears vertically short. The maxillary midline is off to the left side about 1 mm. The tip of the nose is off to the left about 2 mm. The mandibular dental midline is about 5 mm off to the left. However, the center of the lower right central incisor is pretty much aligned to the chin. The chin is shifted to the left just slightly about 3 mm. She has severe abrasions of her lower anterior teeth from cuspid to cuspid. In fact, the teeth are worn down almost to the gingiva on those teeth. In profile view, she has somewhat of AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 3 mm. The chin actually has fairly good projection, although could be just slightly deficient. The chin neckline is fairly long and chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. She appears a little bit short in the lower third face. When B106 opens up to where her lips just begin to separate, she has fairly good facial balance. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has significant lower arch asymmetry where the left cuspid is about at least 3 to 4 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a slight Class III cuspid relationship on the right side and a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the left side. She has an anterior deep bite of probably about 4 mm. Transversely, she has just a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 1 to 1.5 mm higher than the right side. The oropharyngeal tissues all look healthy and normal. The nasal septum is deviated significantly off towards the right side with a nasal spur towards the base of the septum. The right turbinate in moderate in size. The left turbinate is quite large, but it appears to have adequate airway because of the deviation of the septum. To palpation, she has very minimal tenderness over the temporalis muscles, TMJs, and retromandibular area. On opening, she has a click in the right joint at about 10 to 15 mm of opening and 5 mm of closing. The left joint seems to function reasonably smoothly. The maximal incisal opening is 50 mm. The excursion movements are 10 mm in each direction.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
Panorex shows the absence of all four third molars, but it is possible she may be missing the mandibular left first molar and the second and third molar have drifted forward in the first and second molar position. She has crowns on almost all the posterior teeth. The sinuses look reasonably clear. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged. She appears to have a short anterior vertical mandibular height.

Left TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology, but with some anterior beaking. There is good vertical joint space. The articular eminence is moderately steep.

Right TMJ sagittal tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology, but with some anterior beaking. There is good vertical joint space. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There may be slightly greater decreased posterior joint space on the right as compared to the left.

Left TMJ coronal view shows a little osteophytic kind of growth off the lateral pole of the condyle that decreases the lateral joint space, but the vertical joint space looks good. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a joint that appears to have fairly good space.
Coronal view shows that she has a significantly deviated nasal septum off towards the right side that blocks a significant portion of the right airway. The left turbinates both inferior and lower turbinates are quite large. The right turbinate appears more normal size. The sinuses look relatively clear.

Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The left turbinate is quite a bit enlarged, but the right one is of a more normal size and shape.
Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a decreased anterior vertical facial height. The oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue only measures about 5 mm. At the soft palate level, it measures about 7.5 mm. The occlusal plane appears to have a fairly low angle. She appears to be somewhat over closed. There is a Bolton's difference of roughly -1.5 mm.

Basic diagnoses would be as follows:
Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction. Maxillary AP and vertical hypoplasia.
Mandibular AP and vertical hypoplasia.
Slight Class III occlusion on the right side and Class II occlusion on the left side. Significant lower arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being 3 to 4 mm posterior to the right cuspid. Maxillary arch asymmetry with the left cuspid being 1 to 1.5 mm posterior to the right cuspid. Severe attrition of the mandibular anterior 6 teeth.
Negative maxillary tooth lip relationship of -3 mm.
Mandibular dental arch asymmetry with the dental midline being shifted 3 to 4 mm to the left of the chin midline. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Nasal septal deviation off towards the right side with septal spurring. Hypertrophied left turbinate. Rule out ankylosis of the maxillary left second bicuspid.

Recommended treatment would be as follows:
1. MRI of left and right TMJ.
2. Presurgical orthodontics. a.	Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Leave the maxillary left second bicuspid elevated if it is anklyosed, otherwise try to extrude it down into the occlusal plane.
b.	Continue to align and level mandibular arch. Consider opening up space in the left mandibular quadrant perhaps between the bicuspids to push the anterior teeth forward on the left side shifting the midline to the right at least 3 mm and distalizing the posterior teeth. If the space opens up to equal the size of a bicuspid, then eventually an osteointegrated implant can be placed. If not, then the space would be surgically removed at the time of the orthognathic surgery. Tip first bicuspid root mesially and second bicuspid root distally. c.	Consider building up the lower incisors to the height desired by the dentist with temporary crowns so that we can achieve the best possible treatment outcome and dental alignment.
3. Surgery. a.	Right TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. b.	Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it slightly but down graft it 4 to 5 mm. c.	Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance it forward. d.	Anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to increase the vertical height and AP position of the chin. e.	Nasal septoplasty. f.	Partial left inferior turbinectomy. g.	Left body ostectomy if there is not enough room to place a dental implant and crown.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.
5. Restorative dentistry to place an implant and a crown in the space created between the bicuspids and finalize the rest of the restorative work that is necessary.

B106 MRI
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. joint space appears fairly good vertically. The disc appears to be medially displaced. The lateral rim of the fossa is flat.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There is an increased vertical joint space, but there appears to be discal tissue present, although there may be some medial displacement.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little sclerosis on the top of the condyle. There is a little bit of anterior beaking and flattening on the anterior head. The articular disc is thickened, but appears to be in reasonably good position. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space, but not as significant as the opposite side. Left side open view shows that there is fairly good translation of the disc and the condyle with the disc in reduced position.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some anterior beaking and flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. The condyle appears to be a little bit postured forward in the fossa. The articular disc is thickened, but appears to be in reasonable position and almost posteriorly displaced. There is some fluid in the joint space. There is fluid in the superior and inferior joint space to a slightly greater extent than the opposite side. Right TMJ shows that there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the disc.

IMPRESSION:
Left TMJ arthritis with articular disc slightly medially displaced but reducing on opening. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc slightly posteriorly displaced, but good translation on opening.
