B211
B211 is 16 years old. She began orthodontic treatment in the 4th grade, approximately age 10 and she wore headgear for 3 years at night. She had some appliances on by the original orthodontist and then were removed. She subsequently went to see Dr. XXXX and 9 months ago, Dr. XXXX placed orthodontic appliances.

PRIMARY CONCERNS:
1. Retruded jaws.
2. Difficulties eating and chewing.
3. Teeth do not fit together very well.
4. Snoring.
5. Difficulties breathing through the nose.

She takes no medications. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing. She does get headaches at about a level of 7 that occur in the frontal and the top of the head area but only occur about 2 times per month. She rates her TMJ pain at 0, average daily pain at 0, jaw function at 1, diet at 4, disability at 3. She is aware of snoring at night but has no problems with daytime somnolence or sleep apnea.

In frontal view, B211 has fairly good facial balance in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length when held forward is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is at least 6 mm. Mandibular dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Maxillary midline may be about 1 mm to the left. Chin may be just slightly to the right. A little bit of orbital dystopia with the right eye being 1 to 2 mm higher than the left side. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is probably about at least 3 maybe 4 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla appears to be retruded probably a good 6 to 8 mm. Chin is retruded by about 20 mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short though the chin-neck angle is moderately well defined but very obtuse. Intraorally, B211 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has appliances on now. Some minor crowding in the lower arch but also a little bit of spacing. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an unusual shape of the upper arch with some flattening around the front and some mild crowding in that area as well. She has segmental archwires on currently. She has about a 3 mm anterior open bite. She occludes on the right side on the first and second molars and second bicuspids and the same on the left side. She has a Class II end-on occlusion by about 5 mm. She has a crossbite tendency on the right posterior side. Oropharyngeal airway looks reasonably healthy. The uvula and soft palate appear normal. Faucial pillars appear moderately constricted. Tonsils seem relatively normal in size. She has a wide columella and somewhat narrow nostrils. Septum appears reasonably straight. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged particularly for the narrow transverse dimension of the nose itself. To palpation, B211 has no pain around the head and neck area. Joints function smoothly. Incisal opening is about 52 mm. Maximal incisal opening is 52 mm. Excursive movement to the right 7 mm, left 8 mm.

RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION
: Panorex shows the presence of 4 impacted third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Septum appears relatively straight. Difficult to evaluate the condyles but the left one looks a little different than the right side. Cuspid roots are tipped mesially.

Waters view shows that the bony septum at least is fairly straight. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged with significant blockage of the airway. Sinuses appear relatively clear.

Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There may be a little sclerosis on the top of it. Joint space appears fairly balanced.

Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Joint space appears reasonably balanced. Articular eminence is moderately steep in both joints. On opening there is good translation of both joints. The left condyle appears as though there may be some anterior beaking present.

Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B211 has a retruded maxilla and severely retruded mandible. She has anterior open bite. She has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology. Oropharyngeal airway is only about 2.5 mm at the base of the tongue and no more than 3 mm at the soft palate level. She has some prominence of the nasal dorsum. Bolton analysis shows that there is some relatively small tooth size discrepancy although on the model assessment it appears that the upper laterals are small. On the other hand it appears that the lower teeth may have been slenderized.

BASIC DIAGNOSES:
1. Severe AP mandibular deficiency.
2. AP maxillary deficiency.
3. Anterior vertical maxillary excess.
4. High occlusal plane angle.
5. Class II end-on occlusion.
6. Anterior open bite of 3 mm.
7. Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of 2 mm (normal dimension 11 mm.)
8. Snoring.
9. Crowding of maxillary arch.
10. Mild crowding of lower anterior arch.
11. Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x4.
12. Wide columella and narrow nostrils.

RECOMMENDED TREATMENT:
1. MRI of left and right TMJs.
2. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. Use a continuous archwire in the upper arch. Tip the lateral incisor mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies if necessary. Disconnect second molars from the archwire. b. Align and level mandibular arch. Disconnect second molars from the archwire.
3. Surgery. a. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superiorly, level the curve of Spee and correct the transverse cant in the occlusion. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise rotation with pogonion coming forward approximately 20 mm. c. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. d. Nasal columella reconstruction. e. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.
4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.

MRI EVALUATION
Age: 16/F
Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. Difficult to identify discal tissue between the condyle and fossa. The disc may be anteriorly displaced. Joint space seems adequate although slightly decreased out laterally.

Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be adequate joint space but difficult to identify discal tissue. There may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. Transverse width of the fossa on the right side seems more narrow as compared to the left side.

Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic. There is some flattening on the posterior head and a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting down towards the articular eminence. There does not appear to be any significant fluid within the joint space. No open static views are included unfortunately in this study.

Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes with a little bit of flattening on the posterior had and a little bit towards the anterior aspect. The articular disc is more prominent towards the lateral aspect of the joint than the medial aspect. The disc is anteriorly displaced sitting down wards the articular eminence. I would suspect that the disc would reduce on opening but no open static views are available.

IMPRESSION:
1. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with probable reduction (open static views not available.)
2. Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with probable reduction (open static views not available.)
