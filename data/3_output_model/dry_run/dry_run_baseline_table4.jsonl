[GUARDIAN] insisted that the patient looks worse than when he started and had multiple questions/complaints. His main questions were, \"Why are there still spaces on the top?\" and \"Why are you taking even more teeth out (aka wisdom teeth)?\" [GUARDIAN] was overall rude and disrespectful. While showing the patient's initial and progress photos, I explained the following: 1. The upper 4's were extracted as pt initially had a large overjet (I said \"overbite\" for patient's better understanding). After extracting the 4's, most of the extraction spaces were used to retract the upper front teeth back to reduce the overjet. 2. The reason spaces are present around the upper 2's is because we had planned for peg lateral buildups. This was a part of the initial treatment plan, to which [GUARDIAN] and patient both agreed to according to the previous orthodontic residents' notes. Final restorations need to be done at the dentist once braces are debonded. 3. The lower 8's are mesially angulated and are against the distal of the lower 7's. There is an operculum covering the lower 7's and the 8's will not erupt naturally due to the angulation. This impaction may cause the patient pain and discomfort in the long run. While it is up to the patient and the guardian to remove the 8's, this is a recommendation for the patient's oral health rather than for orthodontics. On explaining #2, it was obvious that [GUARDIAN] was unahppy that he had to visit another dentist and pay for permanent restorations (crowns/veneers). Upon explaining #3, [GUARDIAN] accused \"And who's fault is that? Because you guys took teeth out and the teeth are now tipping.\" I explained that this not true as no teeth were extracted on the lower, and that mesiallywisdom teeth are very common. [GUARDIAN] also said that the extractions were done without his approval and since the patient is a minor and the [GUARDIAN] only speaks Spanish, \"they don't know.\" He also complained that he was not allowed to enter the operatory during the extraction at the OS clinic, and said that this is unacceptable as the patient is still a minor. At the end of the conversation, I asked [GUARDIAN] what he would like us to do to make the patient look better, as he kept insisting that the patient looks worse with \"spaces everywhere\" and that we \"did not do things right.\" He pointed out the shifted midline, for which I explained that the midline shift will be corrected once we finish treatment. [GUARDIAN] said \"Well then do what you need to do, if he looks good at the end I'll be happy.
