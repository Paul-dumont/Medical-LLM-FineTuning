I reassured [GUARDIAN] that I would be taking over pt's tx and that we would schedule appts regularly from now on. Had lengthy discussion with [GUARDIAN] and pt about wearing elastics. They all understand that elastics are critical and need to be worn FT. Pt was given extra elastics to take to school and instructed to change to new elastics after eating. Finishing bends: UL5 distal down (occlusal) UL1 mesial out L5s distal up (occlusal) LL5 attempted distal out bend but was difficult due to severity of step bend. consider repo to correct rotation Pt will get 8x8 CBCT at NV since none has been taken during tx NV: 8x8 CBCT, continue finishing"}]}
