{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B197", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B197\nB197 is 24 years old. She is referred by XXXX, DDS. Her orthodontist is XXXX, DDS MS, 10319.\nPrimary concerns that B197 has include the following\n\nExtreme tooth sensitivity.\nWidespread enamel loss along gum line.\nExcessive wear on teeth.\nFront teeth chipping.\nClenching and grinding of teeth at night.\n\nB197 has no significant TMJ issues. She had orthodontics from ages 13 to 16 with Dr. XXXX. A year or two after her orthodontics were completed, she began developing sensitivity in her teeth and her teeth began to wear. She began hitting more predominantly on her front teeth and began having enamel coming off of her teeth. She developed some periodontal problems around some of her teeth. She even had pain brushing her teeth. She also began developing cavities. She eventually had periodontal surgery on the lower anterior arch last year. She had a mouth guard made to wear at night 8 months ago. More recently, two weeks ago, she had sinus surgery and reduction turbinectomies. Her sinus problem was predominantly in the right sinus with almost complete opacification of that sinus.\n\nB197 has type 1 diabetes and also Hashimoto's thyroiditis. She takes the following medications:\nNovolog insulin.\nSynthroid.\nB197 has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain, and no myofascial pain. She rates her jaw function, diet, and disability all at 0. She gets occasional earaches, but no other joints bother. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime, but does not believe that she does it during the day. She feels that her chin may be a little bit more prominent now than it was a few years ago.\n\nIn frontal view, B197 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 16 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 1 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is just slightly to the right side about 1 or 2 mm. The mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the left side as is the chin. In profile view, she has an obtuse nasolabial angle with the nasal tip turned up some. She may have some slight AP maxillary deficiency of maybe 2 mm. Chin is a little bit prominent by about 5 to 6 mm. The chin neckline is somewhat elongated a little bit. Chin neck angle is well defined. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch. She has some gingival grafting performed in the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She does have some chipping in the upper anterior teeth, particularly on the right side involving the central incisor and lateral incisor. She is wearing on the lower anterior teeth on the labial surface. She has about a 2 mm anterior over bite. Upper incisors are quite thinned down. She has a fairly tight Class I cuspid relationship bilaterally with just a slight 1 mm Class III on the right side. She does have some crenations on the lateral border of her tongue bilaterally. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal. It appears as though she has a deep oropharynx. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. The incisal opening is 49 mm, excursion movement to the right about 9 mm and to the left about 7 mm. Joints seem to function reasonably smoothly.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The right sinus is a little bit cloudy. She has a brachiocephalic facial morphology. She has decreased anterior and mandibular vertical height. Gonial angles are quite angular. She has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower anterior arch.\n\nCoronal view shows that she has relatively normal size turbinates. There is currently an adhesion between the left turbinate and septum. The left sinus is clear. The right sinus is smaller in size and is full of fluid that could be related to the recent surgery.\n\nAxial view shows that the right sinus is small in size. The septums are reasonably straight and turbinates are relatively normal in size. The right sinus is full of fluid.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is flattened on top with some anterior beaking present. The joint space looks reasonably good. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with flattening on the posterior head and some anterior beaking present. The joint space looks fairly good. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows that the condyle has fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. There appears to be decreased lateral joint space that may account for the slight noise that she heard in the left joint. It does appear that the disc is medially displaced.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm and appears to be more decreased in the lateral joint space compared to the vertical joint space that could correlate to a medial displacement of the articular disc.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B197 has a low occlusal plane low mandibular plane angle facial morphology. The chin is somewhat prominent. She has over angulation of the maxillary incisors, but the angulation of the crown from the root is fairly significant, placing the crown in a better aesthetic position relative to the long axis of the tooth.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B197 would be as follows:\nBilateral condylar hyperplasia (arrested growth at this time).\nMandibular prognathism.\nMandibular AP macrogenia.\nSlight maxillary AP and vertical hypoplasia.\nVertical mandibular hypoplasia.\nClass I occlusion.\nOver angulation of maxillary incisors. Abrasion and attrition of the teeth.\nMultiple dental hypersensitivities.\nClenching and bruxism.\nEnamel dysplasia.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nMedications: Klonopin 1 mg q.h.s. to eliminate nocturnal clenching and bruxism. Restorative dentistry with full mouth rehabilitation.\nSurgery: AP reduction genioplasty.\n\nB197 MRI AGE: 24/F\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is a little divot in the top of the condyle. The articular disc is medially displaced and covering about half the condylar head. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The articular disc is medially displaced covering about half the condylar head. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite flattened on top, but has some anterior beaking present. The articular disc is in fairly good position anteroposteriorly. The posterior band is quite thickened and appears almost to have a cystic formation in it. Out laterally, the disc is not as readily seen indicative of medial displacement. The articular eminence is moderately steep. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. There is good translation of the condyles and articular discs.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is quite flattened on the posterior head with some anterior beaking. The articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc appears to be in position, but is not as seen out laterally compatible with medial displacement. There is fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces practically surrounding the condylar head and the inferior joint space. There is good translation of the condyles and articular discs.\n\nIMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs medially displaced.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 24, \"maximum_opening\": \"49mm\", \"diet_score\": 0, \"disability_rating\": 0, \"jaw_function_score\": 0, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching | bruxism | clenching | grinding\", \"earache_present\": true, \"muscle_symptoms_present\": false, \"current_appliance\": \"lower 3 x 3 retainer | mouth guard to wear 8 months ago | lower 3 x 3 retainer\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"current_medications\": \"novolog insulin | synthroid\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medial displacement | right disc displacement | left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacement\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics from 13 to 16\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 24, \"maximum_opening\": \"49mm\", \"diet_score\": 0, \"disability_rating\": 0, \"jaw_function_score\": 0, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": false, \"neck_pain_present\": false, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching | bruxism\", \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 0, \"headache_frequency\": \"none\", \"physical_therapy_status\": \"none\", \"headache_location\": \"none\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"current_appliance\": \"orthodontics | mouth guard\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacement\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": false, \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": 0, \"current_medications\": \"novolog insulin | synthroid\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacement\", \"muscle_pain_score\": 0, \"joint_pain_areas_score\": 0, \"current_appliance\": \"orthodontics | mouth guard\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": 0, \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics from ages 12 to 13\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": 0, \"joint_pain_areas_score\": 0, \"earache_present\": false, \n\"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": false, \"pain_onset_date\": \"age of 13\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"muscle_pain_location\": \"none\", \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 0, \"headache_frequency\": \"none\", \"pain_onset_triggers\": \"clen"}

Incisal opening is 32 mm. She really has no complaints or issues at this time. She has an appointment with Dr. ___ in 3 weeks and she is to return to see me in 3 weeks.\n\nB252 \nB252 is 15 years old, referred by Dr. ___ . B252's TMJ problems began when she was about 12 years of age of unknown etiology. She completed first stage orthodontic treatment 4 years ago and was placed in some retainers. Dr. __ did not see her again until about 2 months ago, and B252's bite has significantly changed during that time interval. She gets occasional tinnitus and moderate vertigo. She gets headaches now about every other day that occur predominantly in the frontal and temporal areas. She does not really have any TMJ problems per se. She rates her average daily pain at 1, jaw function at 2, and disability at 0. Other joints that bother her includes her knees and ankles. She has been diagnosed as having:\n\nLupus anticoagulant.\nAbnormal homosistine levels.\nShe is being followed by Dr. __. Primary concerns that B252 has include the following:\n\nChange in her bite.\nHeadaches.\nExcessive wearing of the back teeth.\nShe takes the following medications:\nFexofenadine 180 mg q.d.\nFlonase.\nSlow Fe.\nFolic acid.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B252 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. In profile view, she has fairly good facial balance. There is just some slight AP deficiency in the prediction of the mandible. Chin is fairly strong. Chin neckline is fairly close to normal in length and chin neck angle is well defined. Intraorally, Maria has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars present. Teeth are fairly well aligned. She has fairly good attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has almost a full Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally and she has about to 5 to 6 mm overjet. She has an open bite of about 2 mm. She has a slight accentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch. Oropharyngeal tissues looks normal and healthy. She occludes predominantly on the first and second molars bilaterally. Intranasally, the turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum is fairly straight. There is some mild nasal obstruction, but not too significant. To palpation, she has some moderate tenderness to palpation over the TMJs, but nowhere else in the head and neck area. She has an opening click at about 30 mm in the right joint and about 20 mm with closing. The left side seems to function reasonably smoothly. Incisal opening maximally is about 60 mm, and she could open to about 45 mm without significant pain and discomfort. Excursion movements are 8 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nRadiographic evaluation shows that she has four impacted third molars. Condyles appear small in size and it appears they may have degenerative changes. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates look moderately enlarged. Waters view shows the septum is fairly straight. Turbinates appear fairly large and some of this enlargement may be posteriorly. There seems to be a constricted nasal airway. Sinuses look relatively clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows that she is not in centric occlusion when this x-ray was taken. The mandible appears to be postured forward in the fossa. The condyle appears small in size and there is some anterior beaking. Articular eminence is moderate in steepness. She does have impacted third molars x2 on this side. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is a little bit small. Joint space may be relatively normal. A little bit of anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. The patient is in a little bit better Class II position. Condyle is postured less far forward as compared to the opposite side. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B252 has a high occlusal plane angle in facial morphology. She has an anterior open bite and a Class II malocclusion. Oropharyngeal airway is somewhat constricted to the lateral incisors. There is fairly angulation relative to the mandibular basal bone. She does have some increased soft tissue thickness in the progonion. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue is reduced about 5 mm and at the soft palate about 11 mm.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B252 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ adolescent internal condylar resorption. Severe AP mandibular hypoplasia. Transverse maxillary hypoplasia. Class II end-on occlusion. High occlusal plane angle.\nOccludes only on the first and second molars. Anterior open bite of about 2 to 3 mm. Headaches. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.\nHypertrophied turbinates. Mouth breathing particularly at night. Impacted third molars x4.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPresurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Open up about 1 mm of space between the upper laterals and cuspids to help correct her tooth size discrepancy. Surgery.\nBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor.\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to expand it and advance it slightly. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies.\n3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB252 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Incisal opening is 38 mm. Excursion movements are 3 mm in each direction. She is very comfortable. Occlusion looks great. Nasal airway is good. She really has no complaints or problems. She is progressing very well and to return to see me in 3 months.\n\nB252 \nB252 is 6 months post surgery and doing very well. Her occlusion looks very good. She has really no complaints at this time. She is happy with her outcome. She is to return to see us in 6 months for a 1 year followup\n\nB252 \nAGE: 15/F\nDOB:\nDate of Acquisition: \nDate of Interpretation: \nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit small in size and appears to have perhaps lost some vertical dimension and volume. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. There is decreased superior joint space. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condylar head. There could be some lateral disc displacement.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears slightly larger than the left side, but there is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle and with a little bit of lateral displacement.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic and may have lost some vertical dimension. There is some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The disc is anteriorly displaced and siting almost beneath the articular eminence.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B302", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B302 \nB302 is 46 years old, referred by Dr. __. B302 is in good health with no major medical problems except he does have some allergies. He does not take any medications. Apparently no known allergies to medications. B302 has never had orthodontics. Apparently congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisors in the upper arch but appears to have the rest of his teeth. B302 is not sure when his jaw joint problems began and there is no known etiology. B302 has had not treatment for his jaw problems to date. He has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. Other joints that bother him include his back where he has a herniated disc and he has been diagnosed as having scoliosis. He is not aware of clenching or bruxing. Headaches that he gets occur around two times per month at about a level of 3 but can reach a level of 7 to 8. TMJ pain is about a level of 2 with the right side worse than the left side. Average daily pain is about a 1, jaw function at 5, diet at 1, disability at 2.\n\nPRIMARY CONCERNS:\nJaws popping and aching.\nDifficulty breathing through the nose.\nDifficulty swallowing.\nHeadaches.\nTMJ pain.\nDaytime tiredness that requires sometimes taking naps.\nSnoring.\nSleep apnea concerns.\n\nIn frontal view, B302 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 26 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is 0. Mandibular dental midline is 2 to 3 mm off to the left side. Maxilla is retruded probably about 6 mm or so. Chin is retruded probably 20 mm. Chin-neckline is short and chin-neck angle is absent. Intraorally, B302 does have all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. Some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. Transverse narrowness in the lower arch is present. In the upper arch, he is missing lateral incisors. Transverse width of the arch is narrow. He has a curve of Wilson. Lower arch has a slight increased curve of Wilson. He has basically a Class I cuspid relationship. He has a 2 mm vertical overbite relationship. Slight transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being maybe 1 mm higher than the left side. He has oral dystopia with the right eye being 1 to 2 mm higher than the left eye. As B302 bites his teeth together, his mandible tends to shift an extra mm towards the right side. In centric relation, however, the mandibular midline and chin midline appear to be fairly close to the facial midline. Oropharyngeal airway demonstrates what appear to be healthy tissues. Uvula may be slightly elongated. Soft palate may be mildly elongated. Faucial pillars are relatively normal or perhaps slightly constricted. Intranasally, the anterior part of the septum is tipped off towards the left side but the mid part of the septum is off to the right side. Turbinates are moderate in size. The right side seems to have more airway obstruction compared to the left side and today he can breathe better through the left side although he says it does switch from side-to-side at times. Holding the left nostril open, he can breathe better. On the right side he cannot determine too much difference. Snoring is moderate. Daytime somnolence is moderate and sleep apnea syndrome is mild.\n\nB302 \n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n:\nB302 is missing maxillary lateral incisors and all four third molars. He has a little calcification around the root apex of the mandibular left cuspid. Both condyles appear arthritic. Sinuses appear reasonably clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size.\n\nWaters view shows that the bony nasal septum is deviated and there may be a spur at the superior right side. The right turbinate appears moderately enlarged while the left one looks relatively normal in size. Sinuses look relatively clear with essentially no development of the frontal sinuses.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic with a pseudocyst in the top of it. Decreased superior and posterior joint spaces. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram likewise shows a condyle that appears to have a pseudocyst in it. Decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the left joint and not quite as good of translation on the right side although on the the translation was quite good in both joints.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B302 has AP retrusion of the maxilla and mandible. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 3 mm at the soft palate level and about 5 to 6 mm at the base of the tongue. The tongue seems to fill a good portion of the oral cavity except for the very anterior aspect. He has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship. He has a moderately steep occlusal plane angle. To palpation he has some mild tenderness over the right masseter but no other pain around the head and neck area. On jaw function he does have a definite pop in the right TMJ probably 30 mm of opening and 20 mm of closing. The left joint seems to function relatively smoothly. The right joint also has some crepitus types of noises. Maximal incisal opening is 63 mm. Excursive movement is about 12 mm in each direction.\n\nB302's wife states that she feels that B302's profile has become more retruded in the chin area than when they first met when B302 was 20. Tooth size analysis evaluating the maxillary cuspids and centrals with the lower anterior six teeth shows that there is a difference of about 15 mm of spacing that would need to be created to accommodate the maxillary incisors and coordinate that with the lower anterior six teeth. However, both the maxillary and mandibular cuspids and incisors are excessively wide anteroposteriorly which will create a little bit more discrepancy in tooth size analysis. In fact, using the bicuspid as the cuspid and the cuspids and lateral incisors in the upper arch would actually work out as a pretty good tooth size balance. Space would be required to almost equal the size of the maxillary cuspids. An option might be to open up spacing back in the bicuspid area instead of in the lateral incisor area. Using the first bicuspids as cuspids reveals a good match tooth-size-wise between the upper and lower anterior six teeth.\n\nB302 \nBASIC DIAGNOSES:\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with significant degenerative changes.\nAP maxillary deficiency.\nPosterior vertical maxillary deficiency.\nAP mandibular deficiency.\nAP microgenia.\nHigh occlusal plane angle.\nMissing maxillary lateral incisors. Class II cuspid molar relationship.\nSignificantly decreased oropharyngeal airway of about 3 mm (normal 11 mm.) Deviated nasal septum. Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. TMJ pain. Headaches. Sleep apnea symptoms. Snoring. Daytime somnolence.\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlign and level maxillary arch. Open up bicuspid space between the bicuspids bilaterally. Align and level mandibular arch. Consider slenderizing the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them any further forward.\nCT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)\nSurgery.\nBilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance in a counterclockwise direction. Bilateral coronoidectomies.\nBilateral fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen or buttocks.)\nBilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\nOsseointegrated implants and crowns to place teeth in the bicuspid area.\n\nB302 Evaluation Age: 46/M\nDate of Birth: \nDate of : Date of Interpretation:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B520", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B520\nB520 is 17 years old. B520 was referred by Dr. XXXX. B520's TMJ issues began when she was about 13 years old. That is when she first started to notice that her chin was becoming somewhat retruded and she developed pain. Etiology is unknown. B520 had orthodontic treatment the first time at age 8 and then from about the age of 12 to 13. She wore elastics and apparently her bite was reasonably well corrected. She had splint therapy for the past 2 years to present time. Splints have been made by Dr. XXXX. B520 has had lots of adjustments on the splints, and she can tell that it is ineffective at the present time. She also has had physical therapy last year that included dry needling and exercises. She has also been treated with medications and is currently on Daypro 600 mg two times per day and birth control pills. She has been prescribed Enbrel but has not started taking that medication yet.\n\nB520 rates her TMJ pain at a level of 8 and her daily pain levels reach a level of 8 to 9. She rates her jaw function at 4, diet at 5, disability at 6. She has no problems with headaches. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus nor vertigo. She has no hearing loss. She has problems with her right hip. She has stiff hands and fingers in the mornings. B520 has had reactions to penicillin, cephalosporins, naproxen, and more recently she has had a reaction to adhesives and tape. She is not aware of any kind of reaction to wearing jewelry. She is aware of clenching her teeth at nighttime. B520 currently wears her splint only at night. She did wear it during the day, but it did not seem to help her situation so she discontinued daytime wear. She does not snore when she sleeps. She has some mild daytime somnolence, but no sleep apnea. She has a moderate sleep disorder where she tosses and turns a lot at night. She does breathe through her mouth at night, but not so much during the day. She sleeps on her sides and stomach.\n\nIn frontal view, B520 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 3.5 mm. The maxillary midline looks as though it is on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is 1 mm to the right and chin is about 3 mm to the right. In profile, B520 has a head postured forward neck position. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is about 3 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is retruded about 6 to 7 mm. The chin is retruded about 22 mm. The chin neckline is short, although the chin neckline is reasonably well defined. She has a lip incompetence of about 5 to 6 mm. Intraorally, B520 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding of the lower anterior arch. She has some lack of attached gingiva around the lower incisors. She already has a little bit of gingival stripping present. In the upper arch, she is missing first bicuspids that were extracted for orthodontic reasons. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship being a little bit greater on the right side than the left side. She has a zero over bite relationship. She has an over jet of about 2 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal and healthy. There is a significant cant in the transverse occlusal plane with the right maxillary cuspid being at least 3 mm higher than the left side. The mandible is elevated on the right side about 1.5 to 2 mm at the most. The vertical discrepancy is greater in the maxilla with the right cuspid being at least 3 mm higher than left side. She does have some constricture of the luminal valves. The maximal incisal opening is 44 mm, opening without pain 18 mm. The excursion movements are 9 mm in each direction. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseters, retromandibular area, and TMJ area with the right TMJ being worse than the left.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. It appears as though she may be missing her maxillary second bicuspids or could be the first bicuspids. The sinuses appear relatively clear. The septum appears reasonably straight and turbinates appear moderately enlarged. She has severely resorbed condyles.\n\nCoronal view shows that she has enlarged turbinates. The septum appears reasonably straight. Sinuses appear clear.\nAxial view shows that the septum is reasonably straight. Turbinates are moderately enlarged and appear to block the airway. Sinuses appear relatively clear.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal tomograms shows a severely resorbed condyle with loss of vertical as well as anteroposterior bone structure. The articular eminence appears to have some uneven areas, although it has a moderate inclination. The joint space actually appears somewhat increased vertically.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal tomograms shows a severely resorbed condyle with loss of vertical as well as anteroposterior bone structure. The articular eminence appears to have some uneven areas, although it has a moderate inclination. The joint space actually appears somewhat increased vertically.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal tomograms show a condyle that shows evidence of major condylar resorption. There is some medial beaking of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves downward about 2 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone greater resorption than the left side with extremely narrow mediolateral dimension of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. Both condyles are severely resorbed and deformed.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a retruded maxilla but anterior vertical maxillary excess and posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. The mandible is severely retruded. She has a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures 4 mm and at the base of tongue measures 4 mm. She has adenoid tissue in the nasopharyngeal area and she has an airway dimension of about 4 mm between the adenoid tissue and the turbinates and between the adenoid tissue and the soft palate. She was not in centric relation and she has almost an end-on incisor relationship.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B520 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\nMaxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.\nMandibular AP hypoplasia.\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 4 mm (normal AP dimension 11 mm).\nHypertrophied turbinates.\nNasopharyngeal hyperplastic adenoid tissue.\nAP microgenia.\nEnd-on Class II occlusion.\nAnterior open bite.\nHigh occlusal plane angle of 25 degrees (normal angle is 8 degrees).\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1.\tPresurgical orthodontics. a.\tAlign and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.\tAlign and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing approximately 2 mm of tooth structure and retract to decrease the over angulation.\n2.\tCT scan of jaws and jaw joints.\n3.\tSurgery. a.\tBilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.\tMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance in a counterclockwise direction. c.\tBilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.\tBilateral coronoidotomies. e.\tNasopharyngeal adenoidectomy. f.\tBilateral partial nasal turbinectomies. g.\tMedpor implant to mandible.\n4.\tPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB520 MRI\nBIRTH DATE:\nDATE OF ACQUISITION:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has lost significant volume. There may be some discal tissue present, but there appears to be a reactive pannus surrounding the disc. The disc could be a little bit medially displaced. The condyle is severely arthritic and narrow mediolaterally as well as a loss of vertical volume.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant condylar resorption. There may be some discal tissue present within the joint, although it appears to be a reactive pannus surrounding the articular disc. There is significant destruction of the condyle with loss of mediolateral and vertical height.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has lost significant vertical height and some anteroposterior dimension as well. There is some anterior beaking of the condyle. The articular disc actually appears to be anteriorly positioned underneath the articular eminence and there is some sort of dense tissue between the condyle and the fossa. There is some inflammation around the articular disc and in the joint space. There is increased vertical joint space between the condyle and fossa. The articular eminence had a moderate inclination. In the T2 images, it shows significant inflammation within the joint surrounding the anteriorly displaced disc as well within the joint space between the condyle and fossa. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle and the deformed degenerated disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is extremely small in size with loss of vertical and AP volume. The disc is hard to identify but may be anteriorly displaced. There is dense tissue within the fossa again. There is increased vertical joint space between the condyle and fossa. The articular eminence had a moderate inclination. On the T2 imaging, there is significant inflammation in the joint space. The disc is difficult to identify. On opening, there is significant restricted translation and difficult to identify any remnant of the disc.\n\nIMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ severe arthritis with significant condylar resorption being worse on the right side than the left side with articular disc anteriorly displaced, degenerated and with reactive pannus filling a majority of the superior joint space area.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B165", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B165\nB165 is 21 years old. They were actually referred by the XXXXs. B165 is in good health except for her jaw problems. She is not sure exactly when her jaw problems began, but the family became aware of a problem at least by the age of 15 of unknown etiology. She had orthodontics for about a year and half from age of 13 to 15. She has new braces on beginning 3 months ago. She gets a headache just about once a month at about a level of 4, but the rest of the time she has no real headache problems. She rates her TMJ pain at 2, average pain at 2, jaw function at 1, diet at 3, disability at 3. She has no trouble with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo. She does occasionally get some hearing loss in the right ear. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime. She has severe snoring, probably moderate daytime somnolence, and probable moderate sleep apnea. She is predominantly a mouth breather day and night.\n\nIn frontal view, B165 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 5 mm on the right and 4 mm on the left. The maxillary dental midline is about 1 mm off to the left side. The nasal tip is about 1 mm off to the right side. The mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm to the left and chin is probably 3 mm to the left. In profile, the maxilla is retruded about 3 to 4 mm and the mandible is retruded about 25 mm. The chin neckline is continuous with no real development of a chin neck angle. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars in position. Teeth are actually fairly well aligned and leveled. She has some stripping of the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back to the second molars present. She has appliances only on her lower teeth including all of the teeth except the second bicuspids. She has an end-on Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally being probably 3 mm Class II. She has an over jet of about 2 mm. She has about a 0.5 mm vertical overbite relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues all look relatively normal. Intranasally, there may be a little bit of deviation of the septum off towards the right side. The turbinates appear moderate in size. She had a head postured forward neck position. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the TMJs and retromandibular area. The maximal incisal opening is 42 mm, opening without discomfort 25 mm. The excursion movement to the right is 7 mm, to the left 6 mm. There is a transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being 1.5 mm higher than the right side.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. There is essentially an absence of the mandibular condyles. The bony septum appears reasonably straight. There is some antigonial notching.\n\nCoronal view shows deviation of the septum off towards the right and then off towards the left at the base of the septum. The right turbinate is quite large in this view and the turbinates seem to block a portion of the airway. The sinuses have increased thickness of the sinus lining.\n\nAxial view shows that the turbinates are enlarged, particularly on the right side, with a little deviation of the septum off towards the left side. The sinuses both at this level appear to have thickened sinus membranes and probable sinusitis.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is severely arthritic with severe condylar resorption. The articular eminence is essentially absent. There is increased vertical joint space.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view likewise shows a condyle that is essentially totally degenerated and resorbed. The articular eminence is flat. It appears there could even be a perforation to the fossa into the middle cranial fossa. The articular eminence has been resorbed as well.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows that the lateral rim of the fossa has been resorbed as well. There is no virtually no vertical stop on the ramus area. Actually, there appears to be an extension of the lateral rim of the fossa where there may be some bone-on-bone contact.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is severely resorbed. The lateral rim of the fossa likewise where the condyle is functioning has very little support. Back in the actual fossa area, there is no condyle as the condyle is postured anterior on the articular eminence or in front of it.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that her condyles actually are functioning completely anterior to the articular eminence and are not in the fossa at all. The maxilla appears slightly AP deficient but vertical hyperplastic but posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. The mandible is retruded in a clockwise direction. She has a severe skeletal Class II jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 5 mm at the soft palate level and 4 to 5 mm at the base of the tongue. The soft palate appears to have relatively reasonable length. She has AP microgenia and a high occlusal plane angle.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B165 would be as follows:\nBilateral severe mandibular condylar resorption.\nTotal disarticulation of mandible condyles with displacement into the temporal fossas.\nMaxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.\nMandibular AP hypoplasia.\nAP microgenia.\nClass II end-on occlusion. High occlusal plane angle of 25 degrees (normal 8 degrees).\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 4 mm (normal AP dimension 11 mm).\nHypertrophied turbinates.\nSleep apnea.\nPeriodontal defects lower anterior arch. Impacted maxillary third molars x2.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1. Gingival graft to anterior mandible.\n2. Presurgical orthodontics: a.\tContinue to align and level maxilla arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.\tAlign and level mandibular arch, but slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and close the spacing.\n3. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).\n4. Surgery. a.\tBilateral TMJ and mandibular reconstructions with mandibular advancement using TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.\tMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction, down grafting the posterior aspect 8 mm. c.\tBilateral coronoidotomies. d.\tBilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). e.\tBilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. f.\tSurgical removal of impacted maxillary third molars x2. g.\tMedpor implant to anterior mandible.\n5. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB165 MRI\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is extremely narrow mediolaterally. I really do not see any good definition of the condyle. There is tremendous destruction of the condyles. The lateral rim of the fossa is flat.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant arthritic changes and resorption. The lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat. There is not much but there appears to be soft tissue present within the joint space bilaterally.\n\nIn sagittal view, it is hard to even find the ramus or condyle at all on the right side. It is almost impossible to identify any condylar structures in these joints. It appears on the lateral view that there may be some bone on the left TMJ, but there are significant degenerative changes and resorption of the articular eminences with the remnants of the condyle functioning anterior to the fossas and almost beneath the articular eminences.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"25mm\", \"patient_age\": 21, \"maximum_opening\": \"42mm\", \"diet_score\": 3, \"disability_rating\": 3, \"sleep_apnea_diagnosed\": true, \"jaw_function_score\": 1, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching | bruxism\", \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"once a month\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"muscle_pain_score\": \"mild\", \"headache_location\": \"\", \"current_appliance\": \"orthodontics 3 months ago\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 2, \"headache_intensity\": 4, \"pain_onset_date\": \"at least by age of 15\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 2, \"sleep_disorder_type\": \"sleep apnea | snoring | daytime somnolence | sleep apnea\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"retromandibular area\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"right tmjearache_present: false\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics from 13 to 15\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 21, \"maximum_opening\": \"42mm\", \"diet_score\": 3, \"disability_rating\": 3, \"jaw_function_score\": 1, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching | bruxism\", \"earache_present\": false, \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"once a month\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 4, \"headache_intensity\": 4, \"pain_onset_date\": \"unknown\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 2, \"current_appliance\": \"orthodontics | braces\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior displacement with reduction | right disc anterior displacement with reduction\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics from age of 13 to 15\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"muscle_pain_location\": \"retromandibular area\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"current_medications\": \"none\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior displacement with reduction | right disc anterior displacement with reduction\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"retromandibular area\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics from age of 1 age of 13 to 15\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tm"}

She has no problems with headaches. She has no earaches, has frequent tinnitus with the right side greater than the left side, but no vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her right hip, left knee, and left shoulder. She does not believe that she clenches and grinds currently. She current takes the following medications:\n\nPremarin 0.3 mg q.d.\nSynthroid 125 mcg q.d.\nBystolic 5 mg q.d.\nVytorin 10/20 q.d.\nFosamax 70 mg weekly.\nB12 injections monthly.\nVitamin D 5000 units monthly.\nAmbien 5 to 10 mg p.r.n.\n\nPrimary concerns that B041 has at this time will include the following:\nTeeth do not fit together.\nLimited jaw function. Speech is affected.\nOpen bite where the back teeth do not touch.\nDifficulties eating and chewing.\n\nB041 also has some mild snoring, moderate daytime tiredness. She does not believe she has sleep apnea, but she has had insomnia for the last 15 years. She has significant difficulties sleeping. She does not have any significant difficulties breathing through her nose. She did have a sleep study done four years and seven months ago. She had no apneic or hypopnea events. She only had about 0.3 minutes under 90% oxygenation. Her arousal index, however, was 9.7 related to spontaneous arousals. She had some snoring and 5 arousals from snoring.\n\nIn frontal view, B041 has reasonably good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face, but some asymmetry in the mandible. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is fairly much on the facial midline. The tip of the nose is off to the right side about 3 mm. The mandibular dental midline is shifted to the left about 4 mm. The chin is 3 mm off towards the left. In profile, the maxilla is retruded 6 to 8 mm and the chin is retruded probably 10 to 12 mm and chin neckline is extremely short. Nose appears relatively prominent. Chin neckline is short and chin neck angle is not defined. She has to have an obtuse nasolabial angle. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale. Intraorally, she is missing the lower first bicuspids. She has significant crowding in the lower anterior arch with the left central incisor blocked almost completely out of the arch in a lingual direction. She probably has about 6 mm of crowding in the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, she is missing the first bicuspid as well. She is in full braces currently with braces back to the first molars. She has a Class III end-on cuspid relationship on the right side being about 3 to 4 mm Class III and on the left side she is closer to a Class I relationship. She does have close to a 2 mm anterior overbite relationship. She has a posterior cross bite on the left side. The maximal incisal opening is 24 mm, excursion movement to the right 5 mm, to the left 0. B041 does have about a 2 mm open bite bilaterally in the posterior occlusion. Joints seem to function reasonably smoothly.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows that the absence of all 4 third molars and absence of the first bicuspids. She has hyper-calcification around the molar teeth in all 4 quadrants. Sinuses appear relatively clear. She has a number of crowns and it looks like a root canal on the maxillary right lateral incisor.\n\nCoronal view shows that the sinuses are clear and turbinates are relatively normal in size. The septum deviates a little bit off towards the left side.\n\nAxial view shows that the sinuses are clear and turbinates are relatively normal in size. The septum is deviated just slightly off to the left side.\nLeft TMJ sagittal tomogram shows that she has severe arthritis in this joint. There is some anterior beaking. There is significantly vertical and posterior joint space. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. There appears to be an osteophyte extending up off the head of the condyle towards the lateral aspect of the joint.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have greater arthritic changes and there also are arthritic changes in the fossa. It appears that there is some reactive bone in and around the joint area. There is decreased joint space towards the medial aspect of the joint.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows arthritic changes. There is significantly decreased vertical and lateral joint space. It appears there is almost bone-on-bone contact. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 4 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows advanced arthritic changes with a pseudocyst in the condylar head and erosions. There are also erosions in the fossa. There appears to be some heterotopic within the joint space. The joint spaces are quite narrow and in some areas appear to be bone-on-bone contact.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B041 has a retruded maxilla and mandible. She has a moderate high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 4 mm at the soft palate level and about 6.5 mm at the base of the tongue. She appears to have a skeletal Class I and occlusal Class I type of relationship. B041 has a tooth size discrepancy with a negative 1 mm.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B041 are as follows:\nRight TMJ severe arthritis and ankylosis.\nLeft TMJ arthritis. AP maxillary hypoplasia and asymmetry.\nAP mandibular hypoplasia.\nClass III occlusion on the right side.\nCross bite on the left side. Missing all 4 first bicuspids extracted for previous orthodontic reasons and all 4 third molars. Significantly decreased incisal opening of 24 mm (normal 45 to 50 mm).\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 4 mm (normal 11 mm).\nDifficulties eating and chewing.\nBilateral posterior open bites.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.\tAlign and level maxillary arch. b.\tAlign and level mandibular arch. Keep all of the teeth and align the lower anteriors. This will tip them forward slightly to an end-on incisor relationship.\n2. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol.)\n3. Surgery. a.\tBilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with eliminate the asymmetry. b.\tMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla. c.\tBilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.\tBilateral coronoidotomies.\n4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB041 MRI AGE: 55/F\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears arthritic. There is decreased vertical joint space. Difficult to identify discal tissue. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is severely arthritic. There is decreased vertical joint space. There appears to be osteophytic extensions off the condyle and also extending down from the fossa. It is difficult to identify discal tissue in this view.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle has some flattening on the anterior aspect of the head and a little bit of anterior beaking. There is decreased joint space and could possibly be bone-on-bone contact. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence, but severely degenerated and deformed. It is quite short anteroposteriorly. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. On opening, there is restricted translation and the deformed articular disc remains anteriorly displaced to reduction.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears quite arthritic. There appears to be a pseudocyst in the head of the condyle. There appears to be some remnants of the disc in the joint space. The joint space is a little bit thicker than the opposite side. There appears to be increased sclerosis in the head of this condyle compared to the opposite side. The articular eminence appears slightly flatter than the opposite side and appears to have some degenerated changes in the subcondylar bone. On opening, there is severe restriction of condylar translation. The degenerative tissues within the joint space appear unmoved.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction and with significant deformation.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B448", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B448\nB448 is 23 years old and referred by a former patient, XXXX. Primary concerns that B448 has are as follows:\n\nHis teeth do not touch.\nConstant tooth and jaw pain.\nHeadaches. Locking. Popping in the joints. He does have some difficulties eating and chewing.\nHe does have a lot of congestion and times has difficulties breathing through his nose and becomes a more prominent mouth breather.\n\nHe takes no medications.\nHe became aware of having jaw problems at about the age of 11 when he was told to see an orthodontist. The etiology is unknown. He has had headaches at least beginning in high school and throughout high school and college. He underwent orthodontics from the age of 11 to 14 by Dr. XXXX. He has essentially had no other treatment for his jaw problems.\n\nB448 rates his TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 6, headaches at 7 that occur predominantly in the frontal and temporal area bilaterally. He rates his jaw function at 5, diet at 3, disability at 2. He gets occasional earaches with the left side worse than the right side and moderate occurrence of tinnitus. He also has a moderate occurrence of vertigo, but has no hearing loss. He has some noisy joints and they are particularly in his wrists and through motion have a lot of crackling sounds. His hands and fingers hurt sometimes. He also has some problems with his neck. He is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime and also during the daytime.\n\nIn frontal view, B448 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular midline is about 3.5 mm off to the left side as is the chin. In profile view, the maxilla is posteriorly positioned at least 6 mm. The chin is back probably around 4 to 5 mm. The chin neckline is a little bit short and chin neck angle is not defined. Intraorally, B448 has all of his lower teeth back to the second molars. He has a wide mandibular arch and the first molars actually have an excessive buccal inclination. He has good attached gingiva. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molars. He has fairly wide arches. He has huge tonsils. This constricts the fascial pillars. Otherwise, the uvula and soft palate appear relatively normal. B448 does appear to have some macroglossia. The nasal septum may be deviated a little bit off towards the right side and at the bottom there is an osteophyte kind of formation that extends into the left side of the nose. The turbinates appear moderate in size. B448 has anterior and bilateral posterior cross bites. The cross bite is a little bit worse on the left side than the right side. He has a full Class III occlusion on the right side and on the left side he has an end-on Class III by about 3 mm. The mandibular left cuspid is about 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. In the upper arch, the right cuspid may be 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. He has a reverse deep bite of about 2 mm and a reverse over jet of -6 mm. To palpation, he has moderate pain in the temporalis, masseters, TMJs, styloid areas and milder tenderness over the right shoulder. Joints function relatively smoothly, but he does feel slight crepitus in his joints. The maximal incisal opening is just 58 mm, excursion movement to the right 4 mm, to the left about 3 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars and B448 says that they never formed. He has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch. He has some relatively short roots on the bicuspids in the upper arch and slightly elongated condylar heads and necks.\n\nCoronal view shows that the sinuses are clear. He has some deviation of the nasal septum. The right turbinate is quite large and appears to contribute significantly to nasal airway obstruction on that side. On the left side, the turbinate is more normal. Sinuses are clear except there is a little thickening of the sinus membrane along the right lateral sinus wall.\n\nAxial view does show that the right turbinate is enlarged and appears to block most of the functional airway.\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Medially, the condyle is more anteriorly positioned in the fossa and there is a decreased joint space posteriorly. The articular eminence is relatively shallow.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows that medially the condyle is more anteriorly positioned in the fossa and out laterally as well and posteriorly positioned, however, there is slightly greater joint space behind the right condyle out at the lateral aspect of the joints compared to the left side.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There is some decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There is decreased lateral joint space and the lateral rim curves inferiorly about 3 to 4 mm.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has huge tonsils that appear to displace the tongue forward and may be part of the reason that the tongue appears relatively large for the oral cavity. The posterior base of the tongue is completely supported forward by the tonsils. Oropharyngeal airway between the base of the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall is about 14 mm, but at the soft palate level is only 5 mm. This again in part could be due to the extremely large tonsils. He does have a skeletal and occlusal Class III relationship with about a 2 mm reverse deep bite.\n\nB448 has had a fairly consistent cough for about the last 6 to 7 years. His jaw growth is getting progressively worse.\nBasic diagnoses would be as follows:\n\nBilateral TMJ condylar hyperplasia (evaluate if it is active or inactive growth).\nMandibular deviated prognathism.\nMaxillary AP and transverse hypoplasia.\nFull Class III occlusion on the right side, Class III end-on on the left side. Anterior and bilateral posterior cross bites.\nHypertrophied right turbinate. Severely hypertrophied tonsils.\nRelative macroglossia secondary to displacement related to the hypertrophied tonsils.\nTooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 3 mm.\nSlight arch asymmetry with mandibular left cuspid being about 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid and maxillary right cuspid being 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid.\nSleep apnea symptoms. Buccal tipping particularly of the mandibular first molars.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1.\tRemoval of hypertrophied tonsils.\n2.\tPresurgical orthodontics. a.\tAlign and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b.\tAlign and level mandibular arch. Try to tip the first molars lingually to align them more appropriately with the rest of the mandibular teeth.\n3.\tSurgery. a.\tBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.\tPossible high condylectomies to arrest growth if confirmed active condylar hyperplasia is still occurring. c.\tBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to rotate the mandible back on the facial midline. d.\tMaxillary osteotomies to advance and expand. e.\tRight partial inferior turbinectomy.\n4.\tPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB448 MRI\nDOB:\nDATE OF ACQUISITION:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. The disc appears to be medially positioned with the lateral third of the condyle uncovered. There is decreased lateral joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. The disc likewise is medially displaced leaving the lateral third uncovered. There is decreased joint space towards the lateral aspect of the joint. The lateral rim curves inferiorly probably about 3 mm.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology, although the condylar head and neck appear elongated. The disc appears to be in reasonably good position anteroposteriorly. Out laterally, the disc is not as easily seen. In some of the views, it appears that the disc may be posteriorly displaced. The articular eminence is moderately shallow. There is significant amount of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces anterior to the condyle. This may show that the condylar disc is actually in fairly good AP position. On opening, the left TMJ has some restricted translation with the condyle only coming forward just a few millimeters. The disc does not move much. In the cine films, it appears that the disc is posteriorly displaced and then on opening it appears to jump forward into a more normal position.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. The condylar head and neck appear elongated. The disc may be slightly posteriorly positioned. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination to it. There is no fluid within the joint space. The disc appears to be posteriorly position. In the opening views, the disc appears to be in fairly good position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B189", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B189\nB189 is 17 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX, ENT specialist. B189 had orthodontics from the age of 10 to 13 including two phases of treatment. She began developing headaches when she was 14 in the ninth grade of unknown etiology. She has had no treatment except for some physical therapy that was initiated about 5 weeks ago. The physical therapy has helped her with her headaches. When she has the physical therapy, the headache intensity decreases for about 3 days. She had sinus surgery in 3 years ago and she had her wisdom teeth removed 4 years ago.\n\nShe gets daily headaches at about a level of 6 in the frontal and temporal areas bilaterally. She rates her TMJ pain at 2, average daily pain at 4, jaw function at 2, diet at 1, disability at 1. She takes the following medications:\n1. Synthroid 625 mcg per day.\n2. Solodyn 90 mg q.d.\n3. Singulair 10 mg q.d.\n4. Nasonex p.r.n.\n\nShe gets earaches bilaterally, but no tinnitus or vertigo and has no hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She does have hypothyroidism, but takes the Synthroid for that. She does have a history of recurrent sinus infections and ear infections. She does have some GI issues as well. She has been to see a neurologist and has tried various medications, but nothing has been effective without putting her to sleep.\n\nIn frontal view, B189 has good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxilla, mandible, and chin midline are all fairly aligned with each other. In profile, she has good facial balance. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some crowding on the lower arch. She does have a 2 x 2 retainer in the lower arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has a 2-mm vertical overbite relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and normal. Intranasally, the septum may be a little bit deviated off towards the left side with a little deviation back towards the right at the base of the septum, but for the most part it is relatively straight. The turbinates appear just mildly enlarged, however, she does not have any significant nasal airway obstruction. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the temporalis muscles, TMJs, and milder tenderness over the retromandibular area. Maximal opening is 55 mg and she could open to 28 without discomfort. Excursion movements are about 11 mm in each direction.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B189 would be as follows:\n1. Bilateral TMJ arthritis and articular discs laterally displaced and slightly anteriorly at the lateral aspect of the joint.\n2. Relatively mandibular hyperplasia.\n3. Bilateral TMJ pain.\n4. Bilateral headaches.\n5. Myofascial pain.\n6. Earaches.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1. Bilateral TMJ injections with Marcaine to evaluate effect on headaches.\n2. Surgery. a.\tBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair. b.\tBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain occlusion.\n\nB189 MRI\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some degenerative changes with the presence of anterior beaking. The articular disc appears to be in position, but there appears to be a reactive pannus surrounding the disc. The disc could be slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. In the T2 films, there is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. The disc looks in a little bit better shape in these images. Right TMJ sagittal view shows more degenerative changes particularly towards the medial aspect of the joint where there is flattening of the head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. The disc is in reasonably good position, but again there appears to be a reactive pannus surrounding the disc. At the lateral aspect, the disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint space. The disc appears to be in better condition in the T2 films. The disc may be anteriorly displaced particularly at the lateral aspect.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Joint space appears fairly good. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a relatively minimal amount. It appears that there may be some disc tissue present. On the left side, the disc may be laterally displaced. Left dynamic opening shows that the disc appears to be in position and translates well with the condyle.\n\nThe right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width, although there may be some loss of vertical volume. Joint space looks reasonably good, although may be slightly decreased at the lateral aspect. The disc appears it might be laterally displaced.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B333", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B333 \nB333 is 37 years old and will be 38 in 9 days. Referred by __. B333 is in good health with no major medical problems. He takes no medications. Basic concerns that B333 has includes:\nClicking and popping in the jaw joints. Pain in the jaws.\n\nB333 is unsure of when his jaw joints began clicking and popping. However, during the past year, his joints have become quite symptomatic. He has been in splint therapy for bruxism for the past 5 years. He takes occasional Advil or Tylenol when his pain gets more significant. B333 rates his TMJ pain which is fairly constant at about a level of 5, average daily pain at 4, average headaches at about 2 in the frontal and temporal areas bilaterally. He rates his jaw function at 5, diet at 4, disability at 2. He has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, nor vertigo and no other joints bother him. He is aware of clenching and bruxing at night time. B333 did have previous orthodontics from the age of 12 to 14.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B333 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about -2 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted about 1 mm off to the right side. Nasal tip is off to the left side about 2 mm. Chin is off to the right side about 4 mm. In profile view, B333 has some significant AP maxillary deficiency of probably a good 6 mm. Upper lip supra-labrale is probably almost 4 mm posterior to subnasale. Mandible is retruded. Chin is fairly prominent compared to the AP position in the lower lip. Chin neckline is not well defined. Chin is probably posteriorly positioned about 8 mm. B333 is missing the lower first bicuspids. He has a lot of wear on his posterior teeth. The lower incisors appear to be in a little bit of lingual inclination. Transverse with the lower arch is fairly constricted. In the upper arch, B333 is missing the upper first bicuspids as well as. These teeth were extracted for previous orthodontics. He has a slight Class II cuspid relationship on the right side by 2 mm and on the left side he has just a slight Class III cuspid relationship by 1-2 mm. He has about 0.5 mm of vertical overbite. He has relatively small upper lateral incisors. He may have just a slight cant in the occlusal plane with the left side being down no more than 1 mm. Uvula is somewhat elongated. The soft palate and fascial pillars look normal. Tonsils are maybe moderately enlarged, a little bit more so on the left side than the right side. Intranasally, he has an enlarged turbinate on the left side. On the right side, it appears that posteriorly the septum deviates off towards the right side and appears it may touch against the turbinate. He has some mild snoring, but no sleep apnea symptoms apparently. B333 has had all four wisdom teeth removed. To palpation, he has some mild tenderness over the styloid area, but no other tenderness around the head and neck area. On opening, he has an audible click in the left joint at about 20 mm and a closing click at about 10. On the right side, he has a softer click at probably about 25 mm and a closing click that is a little bit more noticeable at 15 mm. As B333 opens his jaw, he has to shift his mandible off towards the right side, open some, and then go back towards the left in order to open completely. In excursion movements, B333 has an audible pop in the right TMJ and the left side is a little bit less noisy. Maximal size opening is 53 mm, opening without significant pain 40 mm. Excursion movement to the right 8 mm, to the left 7 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars as well as all four first bicuspids. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Waters view shows that there is a septal spur off towards the right side intranasally and some deviation of the bony septum off towards the right side. The turbinates appear moderate in size with the left one appearing larger than the right one. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis on top. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There appears to be decreased posterior joint space and superior joint space. On opening, there is better translation of the right condyle than the left condyle. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B333 has retruded maxillary and mandibular dental alveolar processes. Chin is fairly prominent compared to the AP position of the dental alveolus. Oropharyngeal airway actually appears to have pretty good opening with about 9 mm at the soft palate and about 12 mm at the base of the tongue. B333 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 4.5 mm. Basic diagnoses for B333 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ mild arthritis, but articular discs anteriorly and medially dislocated.\nAP maxillary deficiency. AP mandibular dental alveolar hypoplasia. Macrogenia.\nSlight Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and slight Class III cuspid relationship on the left side. Small upper lateral incisors.\nTooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 4.5 mm.\nTMJ pain. Missing maxillary and mandibular first bicuspids that were removed previously for orthodontic reasons.\n\nTwo treatment options were presented to B333.\nTREATMENT OPTION 1:\nPresurgical orthodontics.\na. Place appliances on maxillary arch.\nPlace appliances on mandibular arch. Surgery.\nBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain the occlusion, but allow the condyles to move downwards and forwards to make room for the articular discs.\nPostsurgical orthodontics with consideration for opening bicuspid spaces and tipping the incisors forward as well as perhaps distalization of the posterior teeth to make room for the previously extracted first bicuspids. Restorative dentistry.\na. Placement of 4 dental osseus implants.\nb. Place crowns on the 4 implants. TREATMENT OPTION 2:\n\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlign and level maxillary arch. Open about 1 mm of space around each upper lateral incisor but also open spacing for replacement of the first bicuspids. This may require distalization to a certain extent of the second bicuspids and molars. Open up spaces in the lower arch in the first bicuspid area to accommodate bicuspid replacement. The presurgical orthodontics will flare the upper and lower incisors forward.\nSurgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance it forward and increase the occlusal plane angle.\nMaxillary osteotomies to down graft the anterior aspect approximately 2 mm and move the posterior aspect upwards 2 mm as well as advance the maxilla forward about 6-8 mm at the incisal edge.\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\nRestorative dentistry.\nPlacement of 4 osteointegrated implants. Place crowns on the 4 osteointegrated implants.\n\nB333  MRI EVALUATION \nAGE: 37/M\nDOB: \nDate of Acquisition:\nDate of Interpretation: \nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width.

She is referred by Dr. __.\nPatient History\nB327 is in good health with no major medical problems. She is 4 feet, 10-1/2 inches and weighs 88 lb.\n\nB327 has no trouble with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is allergic to cats and dogs. She has no known allergy to jewelry. She gets headaches that range from 3 to 8 in the frontal and temporal areas, and these occur one to two times per week. Sometimes she will get light sensitive, and the headaches can cause nausea. She is not aware of any nocturnal clenching or bruxism. Prior to being placed on the atenolol, she would get headaches about every other day. Now she gets headaches just once or twice a week. Her headaches are beginning to increase again, and she feels that the atenolol is not being as effective anymore. She rates her TMJ pain at 7 and overall pain at 7 on an average day. She rates her jaw function at 6, diet at 5, and disability at 6.\n\nHer problems began about four or five years ago when she began getting headaches, but they were infrequent. In the fourth grade, she started to get the more frequent migraines. In sixth grade is when she was placed on the atenolol. She does have some problems with both her thumbs. About the first of April, she jammed her right thumb and tore some ligaments in it, and it is still tender and sore for her. In June, she hurt her left thumb playing volleyball, but it is better now and doesn't seem to bother her. She has been told that she has loose joints.\n\nPatient Concerns\nHeadaches\nDifficulties eating and chewing\nLower jaws become more retruded\nHer overbite has increased during the last couple of years\nHer head is postured forward more than it used to be\nPain in the jaw joints\nNoises in the jaw joint\nWhen she wakes up in the morning, her jaws are sore (over her masseter muscles)\nShe has pain when she yawns in the masseter muscle and TMJ area\nPredominant mouth breather when sleeping\n\nCurrent Medications\nAtenolol 25 mg, 1 q.d.\nAllegra p.r.n. Ibuprofen for her headaches\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B327 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetric. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 5 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is a little bit to the left, and chin is about 2 mm to the left.\n\nIn profile view, she has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. Chin is retruded probably about 15 mm. Soft tissues may be retruded by a couple of millimeters.\n\nIntraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Some hypereruption of the lower central incisors. Some mild crowding, lower anterior arch. Has good attached gingiva around the anterior arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a slight Class II end-on occlusion by probably about at least 3 to 4 mm. She has an overjet of probably 2 mm. She has a vertical overbite of probably about 4 mm. She has a slight transverse cant in the occlusion with the left cuspid being about 1.5 to 2 mm higher than the right cuspid, so the left cuspid is elevated 1.5 to 2 mm higher than the right cuspid.\n\nTurbinates are moderately enlarged particularly on the left side, and this might cause some breathing problems as she states she breathes predominantly through her mouth when she sleeps. Oropharynx appears clear. Tonsils are present but are of moderate size. To palpation, she has some mild to moderate pain over the masseters, TMJs, and styloid area with the right side being a little bit worse than the left side. Joints seem to function relatively smoothly, although she would occasionally hear a glitch in the right joint. Maximal incisal opening was 33 mm but only 28 mm with reasonable comfort. Excursive movements were 8 mm to the right and 7 mm to the left, but it was painful on the right side for her to do the excursive movements.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows that the sinuses appear reasonably clear, although there is a little fuzziness in the left one. Turbinates look moderate in size. Has all of her teeth back through the second molars, except she has no lower third molars but appears to be developing maxillary third molars. Condyles appear to have undergone some significant bony changes and resorption. No other significant pathology noted.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses appear reasonably clear with the left one showing some material in it. Frontal sinuses are better developed on the left side than the right side as are the ethmoid sinuses, but they all appear relatively clear.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows that the condyle has undergone some significant resorption. Very minimal joint space available. Condyle is postured forward in the fossa somewhat. Appears to be significant loss of vertical height of the condyle. Articular eminence is relatively shallow.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows that there has been considerable condylar resorption that has occurred. Appears to be an osteophytic formation extending posteriorly on the condylar head causing decreased posterior joint space as well as decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminence on this side likewise is extremely shallow. The condylar head is quite flat, and there appears to be significant vertical loss of condylar bone with the resorption process.\n\nTranslation shows minimal translation of the joints.\nCephalometrically, she has a skeletal Class II relationship. Oropharyngeal airway appears good, but her head is postured forward, and her head is tipped up. Turbinates extend posterior to the hard palate. She has a little bit of nasopharyngeal adenoid tissue but not too significant. Oropharyngeal airway with the head posture projected shows that the airway is fairly good.\nBasic Diagnoses\n\nBilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis with reactive pannus surrounding the articular disc and with possible lateral disc displacement.\nAnterior vertical maxillary excess.

Slight downward curvature of the articular eminence. Joint space is decreased vertically. More toward the anterior part of the joint, it appears that there is some kind of material displaced out lateral to the condyle, head, and neck area. Cortical bone appears intact, although there may be evidence of condylar resorption.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears narrow mediolaterally. Mediolateral pole of the condyle is significantly taller than the medial aspect of the condyle. More significant downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears there has been some condylar resorption. Discal tissue not easily seen except there is some kind of tissue extending out lateral to the condylar head that could indicate a laterally displaced disc.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that doesn't show up really prominently radiographically. Cortical bone appears to have undergone degenerative changes on top of the condyle. Articular eminence is long but moderately shallow. Articular disc appears to be in position, although the posterior osteophyte extends posterior to the disc. Appears like there almost could be a pannus around the disc, probable reactive pannus, around the disc. Condyle appears in about two or three of the cuts.\n\nOn opening, there is moderate translation of the condyle. Disc does not seem to move very well and could possibly be adhesions to the articular eminence. Condyle comes down along the posterior slope of the eminence but does not go beneath it.\n\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with a very similar morphology. Appears to be loss of vertical height, but there is an osteophyte extending posterior to the head of the condyle. Disc appears to be in proper AP position, but there is tissue surrounding the disc itself as one would see in a pannus.\n\nRight TMJ, open views, show that the condyle translates moderately well. It appears that the disc remains in its original position indicative of possible adhesions to the fossa.\n\nImpression:\nBilateral TMJ resorptive arthritis with pannus surrounding the articular discs and possible lateral displacement", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"28mm\", \"patient_age\": 12, \"maximum_opening\": \"33mm\", \"diet_score\": 5, \"disability_rating\": 6, \"jaw_function_score\": 6, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": false, \"earache_present\": false, \"adverse_reactions\": \"cats | dogs\", \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"one to two times per week\", \"muscle_pain_score\": \"mild to moderate\", \"migraine_history\": true, \"headache_location\": \"frontal | temporal\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 7, \"headache_intensity\": \"present | range from 3 to 8 | severe\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"four or five years ago\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 7, \"current_medications\": \"atenolol | allegra | ibuprofen\", \"disc_displacement\": \"possible left disc lateral displacement | possible right disc lateral displacement\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"masseters | styloid area\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj | thumbs | left tmj | right tmj\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 12, \"maximum_opening\": \"28mm\", \"diet_score\": 5, \"disability_rating\": 6, \"jaw_function_score\": 6, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"hearing_loss_present\": false, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"left tmj\", \"earache_present\": true, \"onset_triggers\": \"right tmj\", \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"3 to 1 to 2 times a week\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 7, \"headache_intensity\": \"8 | present\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"4 or 5 years ago\", \"headache_location\": \"frontal and temporal areas\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 7, \"current_medications\": \"atenol\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc dislocation with possible lateral displacement\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"splint\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_arthritis_type\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | right tmj\", \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_arthrit"}

She has a slight Class II end-on occlusal relationship by probably about 1 mm or 2.  \n\nShe has an overjet of about 2 mm. Uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all look relatively normal. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal size with the left one being a little bit enlarged. It appears the septum is relatively straight. There does not appear to be any significant nasal airway obstruction. She believes she breathes most of the time through her nose when she is sleeping. She does drool some.\n\nTo palpation, she does have moderate pain over the TMJs and moderate pain to palpation over the temporalis, styloid areas, right masseter and milder discomfort over the shoulders and left masseter. On opening, she had a more distinct click on the right TMJ with probably 25 mm of opening and with a closing click of about 20. On the left side she appeared to have a click of about 35 to 40 mm of opening and closing click of probably somewhere around 25 to 30. On excursive movement she had a definite click in the right TMJ. Maximal incisal opening is about 50 mm but only about 18 mm with comfort. Excursive movements are about 10 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n:\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She is missing maxillary first bicuspids. She has a 3 x 3 retainer. Condyles appear they may be slightly small but not too significant. The right side is a little bit smaller than the left side. The sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged.\n\nWaters view shows that she does in fact have a large left nasal turbinate that seems to block a good portion of the airway. Bony nasal septum appears relatively straight. The sinuses appear reasonably though a little bit of cloudiness in the maxillary sinus towards the lateral aspect of the sinus wall.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle appear to have lost some volume. It seems a little bit short vertically. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Joint space appears within reasonable bounds.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears a little bit changed in shape. Joint space appears fairly reasonable. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Lateral view shows good translation of both joints.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B472 has a retruded maxilla and to a greater extent a retruded mandible. She has a skeletal Class II relationship and a slight Class II occlusal relationship. She has a high occlusal plane angle. She has a decreased oropharyngeal airway of only about 4 to 5 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES:\nBilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and articular disc dislocation with reduction on the right but nonreducing on the left. AP mandibular deficiency. \nAP maxillary deficiency. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.\nClass II end-on occlusion.\nHigh occlusal plane angle.\nTMJ pain.\nHeadaches.\nMyofascial pain. Missing maxillary first bicuspids and all four third molars.\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway of 5 mm (normal 11 mm.)\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlgin and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped forward and cuspid roots tipped distally. Align and level mandibular arch.\nSurgery.\nBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction and decrease occlusal plane angle.\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it in a counterclockwise direction down grafting the posterior aspect. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB472  MRI Evaluation \nAge: 18/F\nDate of Birth:  \nDate of MRI: \nDate of Interpretation:  \nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology although some subtle changes. Increased joint space vertically. There may be some discal tissue medially displaced. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of only about 2 mm. Cortical bone appears to be intact though in some areas it appears thin.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows the condyle may be a little bit mediolateral. Cortical bone appears to be intact although it may be a little bit thin in some areas. Increased joint space vertically. Minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit narrow anteroposteriorly and a little bit flat along the posterior border. Out lateral, it appears there may be some loss of vertical height but difficult to determine. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. It has a decreased anteroposterior dimension with primarily with loss of the intermediate zone. A little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction although there is fairly good translation of both the condyle and the disc.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has more of a hockey stick shape and there may be some loss of vertical volume particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Increased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is sitting anterior to the condyle beneath the articular eminence. Disc is foreshortened anteroposteriorly. There could be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not too much. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and disc.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B488", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B488 \nAge 40. B488 was referred by XX.\n\nB488's problems began last year, when she was 39 years old and was involved in a bus accident. During the accident, apparently she was sitting in the back row with no seat directly in front of her essentially sitting in the middle seat. When the accident occurred, she was thrown forward and she grabbed onto a seat to keep from rolling down the aisle and struck her jaw. She apparently struck it on her right side. Initially, she had quite significant pain in the back of her neck, shoulders, down into her arms and it was even black and blue in these areas. The pain was quite intense and she was not aware of the jaw pain until the first month after the accident she was aware of having tightness and pain in her jaw areas. When she finally was referred to chiropractic treatment, she brought that up to his attention that she had pain in the shoulder, neck and jaw areas. When she went to the chiropractic treatment, she had about 20 sessions about 2 to 3 per week. This made her dizzy and made her very sleepy but did provide no improvement in her pain levels. She then was sent to a pain management doctor who did epidural injections into the lower cervical vertebrae. The injections did not help her. She had the epidural injections done twice, but this did not improve her pain. She then was recommended to have aquatic therapy. She started the aquatic therapy earlier this year and still continues that treatment. Early this year, she tried a splint but this did not help her and, in fact, increased her pain and made the pain more frequent. It caused muscle cramps in the jaws.\n\nB488 rates her headaches at a level of 8 that occur predominantly on the right side in the frontal and temporal area, but they occur bilaterally in the posterior head area and she gets these about three times per week. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw at 8, diet at 6, disability at 9. She gets occasionally right sided earaches, moderate tinnitus and moderate vertigo. She is aware of clenching her teeth severely at nighttime and she also clenches during the day. Other joints that bother B488  include her right shoulder, right elbow, right wrist, right hip, right ankle, neck and back. She has some neuropathies somewhat are affecting her right arm, but since the epidural injections in the cervical vertebrae area, this problem has improved. She still has the pain, but she had numbness through arm and hand that has cleared.\n\nIn frontal view, B488 has good facial balance. In profile, she has good facial balance as well. Occlusally, she has a Class II end-on cuspid-molar relationship and an anterior deep bite of about 9 mm. She has a reversed curve of Spee in the upper arch and an accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch. She has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. She has moderately enlarged tonsils with the right one being larger than the left one. To palpation, she has low severe pain over the TMJs, retromandibular area, right shoulder, high moderate pain over the masseter muscles, right medial pterygoid and right SCM and moderate pain over the left medial pterygoid, left SCM and left shoulder as well as right temporalis area. She has significant clicking and popping in both joints with an opening clicking at about 15 mm on the right and 20 on the left and closing clicks at about 15 mm on the left and 10 mm on the right. The maximal incisal opening is 47 mm, opening without pain only about 20 mm. The excursion movements in each direction are about 7 mm with pain.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged. Sinuses appear relatively clear. She could have a periapical lesion around the mandibular right second molar.\n\nCoronal view shows that the turbinates appear moderately enlarged. The sinuses appear clear.\nAxial view shows that the turbinates are moderately enlarged and the sinuses appear clear.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking. Out laterally, the condyle appears narrow. The posterior head of the condyle appears somewhat flattened particularly towards the medial side of the joint. The joint space appears narrow vertically and posteriorly. The articular eminence has a more shallow inclination.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is flattened on the anterior aspect with some anterior beaking present. There is decreased vertical joint space. The articular eminence has moderate inclination. The vertical joint space appears narrow.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has an odd shape to it where the medial pole is significantly higher than the lateral pole. There is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves probably about 4 to 5 mm. There is decreased lateral joint space.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better morphology than the opposite side. There is decreased vertical joint space. The lateral rim curves inferiorly probably 4 to 5 mm.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 8 mm at the base of the tongue and 5 mm at the soft palate level.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B488 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction.\nMandibular hyperplasia.\nTMJ pain.\nHeadaches.\nMyofascial pain. Class II end-on occlusion with anterior deep bite of 7 mm.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1.\tPresurgical orthodontics. a.\tAlign and level maxillary arch. b.\tAlign and level mandibular arch.\n2.\tSurgery. a.\tBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. b.\tBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maximize the occlusal fit.\n3.\tPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nI will be referring her to Dr. XX. The other person to receive a letter is Mr. XX.\n\nB488 MRI  \nAGE: 40/F\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. The articular eminence is moderate steep.

The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a little bit more arthritic changes associated with it. The joint space is somewhat narrow particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. It is very difficult to tell where the discal tissue is.\n\nLeft TMJ opening shows good translation of the condyle and the disc is in a reduced position on opening. In another view, the disc looks as thought it is of adequate size.\n\nRight TMJ shows that the articular disc is in good positioning on opening and appropriately positioned between the condyle and the articular eminence.\n\nIMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular discs that are quite thin and could be slightly medially displaced with possible disc displacements but with reduction on opening.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"20mm\", \"patient_age\": 40, \"maximum_opening\": \"47mm\", \"diet_score\": 6, \"disability_rating\": 9, \"jaw_function_score\": 8, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"hearing_loss_present\": \"\", \"back_pain_present\": true, \"neck_pain_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching\", \"physical_therapy_status\": \"chiropractic treatment 20 sessions about 2 to 3 per week | epidural injections into the lower cervical vertebrae | aquatic therapy earlier this year and still continues\", \"earache_present\": true, \"onset_triggers\": \"bus accident\", \"headache_frequency\": \"three times per week\", \"jaw_clicking\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"muscle_pain_score\": \"high moderate to low severe\", \"headache_location\": \"right frontal | right temporal | posterior head area\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 8, \"headache_intensity\": \"8 | present\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"39 years old\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 8, \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc laterally displaced with reduction | left disc medially displaced with reduction | right disc medially displaced with reduction\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"retromandibular area | right shoulder | masseter | right medial pterygoid | right scm | left medial pterygoid | left scm | left shoulder | right temporalis\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj | right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 40, \"maximum_opening\": \"47mm\", \"diet_score\": 6, \"disability_rating\": 9, \"jaw_function_score\": 8, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching\", \"earache_present\": true, \"airway_obstruction_present\": false, \"headache_frequency\": \"three times per week\", \"headache_location\": \"frontal and temporal area\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 8, \"headache_intensity\": \"8\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"last year\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 8, \"current_appliance\": \"aquatic therapy\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medial and right disc anterior and medial displacement with reduction\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"appliance_history\": \"chiropractic treatment | epidural injections\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_score\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_areas\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_score\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_rating\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_rating\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"appliance_history\": \"splint | aquatic therapy\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_score\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_score\": \"right shoulder | right elbow | right wrist | right hip | right ankle | neck | back\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_rating\":"}

Decreased joint space vertically at the medial aspect of the condylar pole. Medial beaking of the condyle is present. Roof of the fossa is absolutely flat. The patient has probably had previous surgery. Cortical bone on the roof of the fossa is extremely thin in some areas and actually may be lacking. Cortical bone is intact on the condylar head.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that has undergone significant osseous changes. It is narrow mediolaterally. Some medial beaking present. Sclerosis on the head of the condyle with some small pseudocysts in the condylar head. No joint space between the condyle and fossa. Fossa appears very sclerotic. The roof of the fossa is extremely flat with no downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Degenerative changes are present in the fossa.\n\nLeft TMJ, axial views, show that the condyle has fairly good mediolateral width. Fairly flat in angulation compared to the opposite side. Shape of the condyle looks relatively normal.\n\nRight TMJ, axial view, shows a condyle with fairly significant curvature of the lateral aspect anteriorly as compared to the medial aspect. Appears there is no joint space between the anterior aspect of the lateral pole of the condyle and the articular eminence. Osteophytic formation coming off the medial aspect of the lateral pole of the condyle. The bone appears to be more disrupted as compared to the opposite side.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has a hockey stick shape to it. Anterior aspect is flat. Decreased posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Some roughness on the cortical bone particularly toward the lateral aspect. Significantly decreased joint space out laterally as compared to more medially where there is a little bit greater joint space. Some sclerosis on the head of the condyle. Condyle appears arthritic but not nearly as significant as the opposite side. Some unevenness and even some minor osteophytic formation are present on top of the condyle. Translation is somewhat restricted, but the condyle comes down fairly close to being beneath the articular eminence. Joint space appears decreased although it is present.\n\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that demonstrates significant degenerative changes. There is a small pseudocyst in the head of the condyle. Condyle head and neck are very sclerotic. There is some evidence of bone resorption in the condylar head. Virtually no joint space between the condyle and the fossa and articular eminence. Degenerative changes on the articular eminence as well.\n\nTranslation is restricted with the condyle coming only about two thirds of the way down the articular eminence. At this position, there is no joint space indicative of perforation being present. Pseudocyst in the condyle is larger at the lateral aspect of the condyle and becomes smaller toward the medial aspect.\n\nImpression:\nLeft TMJ arthritis and probable articular disc dislocation\nRight TMJ severe arthritis with bone on bone function\nB264  MRI Evaluation \n\nDate of Acquisition:\t\nDate of Reading: \nLeft TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Joint space appears to be a little bit narrow toward the medial side of the joint. Minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Difficult to tell if discal tissue is in position, but it appears that there is discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Also, the disc could be laterally displaced. Right TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is small mediolaterally compared to the opposite side. Arthritic changes in the condyle and loss of vertical height. Appears to be some roughness on the superior surface of the cortex. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. Normal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa.

Articular disc appears to be anteriorly and laterally displaced. Does not appear to reduce on opening.\n\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows severe osteoarthritic changes and a disc that is severely degenerated. Condyle is quite small on this side with evidence of loss of vertical anteroposterior dimension. Significantly decreased vertical posterior and anterior joint spaces. Evidence of heterotopic or reactive bone formation. Anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is moderately steep, and the eminence itself appears degenerated. Virtually no evidence of discal tissue present on this side that can be identifiable, or there may be some areas of severe degenerative deformation of this disc.\n\nMRIs were reviewed with Dr. __ and we agreed on the following findings:\nLeft TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and laterally displaced without reduction\nRight TMJ severe arthritis\nDr. __ feels that there is significant arthritis in the left joint but obviously not as severe as the arthritis in the right joint\n\nThe best treatment for this treatment would probably be bilateral TMJ total joint prostheses.\nB264 \nB264 is 59 years old and referred by Dr. __.\n\nPatient History\nB264 has had three back surgeries. She has had a bladder and rectum repair, and she has had her ovaries and ovarian cysts removed. She also has had surgery for a ruptured appendix and a hysterectomy as well as two sinus surgeries. She has persistent back pain and leg pain as well as TMJ problems and has low thyroid.\n\nShe has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, and has some hearing loss, but this may be genetic in nature since both her father and her mother have hearing problems. She has high sensitivity to smell. She is very much aware of clenching and bruxing her teeth at night. She has probably had TMJ problems for a long time, but the problems didn't get worse until a few months ago when she has having a root canal done, and her mouth was “cranked open,” and this exacerbated the TMJ problems. Recently, she had a right TMJ arthrocentesis by Dr. __ .\n\nShe does have a history of having two resistant staph infections following her sinus surgeries. Prior to her sinus infections, she had been on Cipro for a while presurgery. Postsurgery is when she developed the resistant staph infections and had to be on IV home therapy on Vancomycin. They then switched her to Synercid. Other joint problems that B264 has include the following: Neck, back, fingers, and feet. She does get epidural injections in her neck that seem to be helpful for her.\n\nB264's TMJ problems began at about the age of 21 when she fell down about 14 basement stairs and hit her head. She developed a closed lock situation. She had all four third molars then removed, but this didn't help her situation. She had extensive equilibrations done, but this did not fix the problem. She had three steroid injections into the right TMJ, and after the third one she did fairly well in reference to her right joint from 20 to 33 years ago when she began developing problems again. At that point she was seeing Dr. __ , who placed her into a splint. She had orthodontics for five years from 15 to 10 years ago. All together she has worn splints for about 20 years. Since April of this year, she has had to wear her splints continuously to be reasonably comfortable in order to eat. She has had physical therapy p.r.n. since 20 years ago until recently. She gets massage therapies weekly as well.\n\nB264 is in recovery from alcoholism for the past 18-1/2 years. She had two pancreatic attacks which stimulated her desire to get into AA and get away from alcohol.\n\nAllergies\nEnvironmental allergies\nCECLOR (anaphylactic shock)\nVANCOMYCIN (red-man syndrome, severe)\nHORSE SERUM AND ANY MEDICATION MADE FROM THAT TYPE OF SERUM creates joint pain and hives\nFLUORESCEIN DYE 10% (head to toe hives, immediate)\nSULFA\nIn addition, she cannot take ORAL PAIN MEDICATION and can only use suppositories\n\nCurrent Medications\nSynthroid 0.1 mg q.d. Protonix 40 mg (for acid reflux)\nZetia (for cholesterol)\nCorgard 10 mg Soma q.h.s. Robaxin 750 mg b.i.d. Vitamin E 600 IU\nDarvocet 50 mg suppositories for her back pain p.r.n. Tylenol suppositories for back pain p.r.n. Estrogen injection therapy q. monthly\nAmbien 2.5 to 5 mg p.r.n. q.h.s. Bimonthly desensitization injections for allergies\n\nPatient Concerns\nRight TMJ comes out of place\nDifficulty eating and chewing\nLower jaws are retruded\nSleep disorder\nTeeth don't fit together\nWakes up with headaches during the night or in the morning\nChronic neck and back pain\nIf she yawns, her right jaw joint will go out of the socket\nIf she tries to chew an apple or anything hard like that, the jaw will go out of the socket\nIf she rests her jaw on her hand on the left side, it will cause the right joint to go out of the socket\n\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B264 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 25 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline. Chin may be a little bit off to the right side about 2 mm.\n\nIn profile view, she has an obtuse nasolabial angle. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by a couple of millimeters. Maxilla is probably 6 mm AP deficient. Chin is retruded about 15 to 20 mm. Chin-neckline is not well-defined, and length is probably less than 20 mm. She has a lot of fullness in the submental area and fullness in the neck area.\n\nIntraorally, she has some significant buccal tipping with a major reverse curve of Wilson in the lower arch. She has crowns on all of the lower teeth. She has an accentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch being a little bit worse on the left side as compared to the right side. Cuspids on forward are elevated probably a couple of millimeters on the right side and probably maybe 3 mm on the left side compared to the posterior teeth. Left cuspid maybe just slightly posterior to the right cuspid by about 1 mm. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an end-on Class II cuspid relationship bilaterally. She has posterior crossbites and major open bites posteriorly of probably a good 5 to 6 mm bilaterally. Oropharynx appears relatively clear. Soft palate and uvula appear relatively normal. She does have a geographic tongue. She doesn't have any problems with her geographic tongue, except when she eats pineapple; it causes a significant burning sensation.\n\nIntranasally, the airway looks clear. It appears that she has had previous turbinectomies with complete removal on the left side and probably at least two thirds on the right side.\n\nIn the closed position, she has about a 4-mm anterior overbite relationship. Maximal incisal opening is about 45 mm, but she can open to about 42 without significant discomfort. Excursive movements are about 9 mm in each direction.\n\nTo palpation, she has some relatively mild tenderness over the right temporalis, left TMJ, and right styloid area. Left joint functions relatively smoothly. Right joint has some significant crepitation associated with it.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows the sinuses appear relatively clear. Septum is in line. Inferior turbinates are essentially absent. All four third molars are absent. She has multiple root canals and this includes the mandibular left possibly second bicuspid but definitely the left cuspid, left central incisor, right second bicuspid in the upper arch, right cuspid, second bicuspid, second molar, and left first molar. She has crowns on all of her lower teeth and all of her upper teeth except for her four incisors and left cuspid. She has arthritic changes in the right TMJ and some mild changes in the left TMJ. There is some dense calcification at the base of the mandibular right second molar mesial root. Just below that area there is a little round area measuring about 4 to 5 mm in diameter that may be just a change in trabeculation pattern in that particular area.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has some flattening on the anterior head. Appears to be some decreased vertical joint space in one of the views, but on the other view it appears better. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Slight hockey stick shape to the condyle.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is quite small in size, and it appears to have lost significant volume. Anterior beaking is present. Decreased vertical joint space, although the posterior joint space is actually increased. Significant posterior open bite present throughout the whole arch.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of the condyle on the left joint and some restriction in translation on the right joint. In the right joint, there is virtually no space between the condyle and articular eminence, whereas in the left joint, there is fairly good space that could be compatible with the disc being in position.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. Turbinates are quite small in size, and the nasal airway is excellent. Some asymmetry is present in the lower jaw with the right angle being probably a good 7 mm elevated compared to the left side.\n\nCephalometric analysis shows that she has a high occlusal plane angle with it actually being a little bit higher in the maxillary arch than in the mandibular arch. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 6 mm at the soft palate level, and at the base of the tongue one of the dimensions measures about 5 mm. Mandible is quite retruded, and maxilla appears retruded. Posterior maxillary aspect appears deficient vertically as well.\n\nBasic Diagnoses\nRight TMJ severe arthritis secondary to steroid necrosis\nLeft TMJ arthritis but condition and position of disc are unknown\nAP maxillary hypoplasia\nPosterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia\nTransverse maxillary hypoplasia\nAP mandibular deficiency\nTransverse mandibular dental excess\nClass II end-on occlusion Posterior open bites of about 6 mm\nReverse curve of Wilson, lower arch\nCrowns on all the mandibular teeth and on all but the maxillary incisors and left cuspid\nTMJ pain\nHeadaches Myofascial pain\n\nRecommended Treatment\nMRI of left and right TMJ to determine the condition of the left joint and the extents of disease created by the right TMJ steroid necrosis\n\nPresurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch.

She just recently had two heart stents placed. She has GERDS.\nShe is currently taking the following medications:\nTiclid to thin the blood.\nCozaar for high blood pressure.\nThyroid medication.\nCorgard.\nRobaxin to help with her back pain.\nAntibiotic for sinus infection which she is almost finished with.\nLidocaine cream to her lips.\nLidocaine gargle for the pain in the roof of her mouth.\n\nShe is getting physical therapy one day a week to try and improve her jaw excursive mobilities but this does not seem to be helping her. She has no headaches and no TMJ pain but does have a burning kind of sensation and pain down through her lower lip and chin area as well as in the upper jaw behind her teeth. In addition she has hypersensitivity to smell though it has been fairly stable for the last 2 years and has not gotten worse. She says her husband John tells her that she looks like a teenager and her face is very symmetric. Her occlusion fits together reasonably well but she does have these pain issues. I believe she probably has systemic factors that are ongoing that are affecting her abilities to heal well. This may account for vascular problems with the maxilla as well as the poor response to her nerves after the usual stretching that goes on with this type of surgery. I told her that in 95% of patients at least do not have this kind of problem after this type of surgery. She says that her brother, 2 sisters and her mother all have had surgeries that have yielded poor outcomes and her physicians tell her that there must be something systemic within her family that interferes with the normal capabilities.\n\nRE: B264 \n\nShe says she has tried Lyrica and Neurontin and has been unable to tolerate those medications as they upset her stomach. I suggested that we try Topamax 25 mg b.i.d. to see if this would help her. The dosage may need to be increased. She will check with her pharmacist to make sure that there is no cross reaction to the other medicines that she is taking and will talk to her pain doctor about perhaps prescribing that for her. It will be important for her pain management doctor to prescribe this for her instead of you or myself only because her pain physician is seeing her on regular basis and managing other medicines for her. She will keep me informed of her progress.\n\nI told B264 I know of no way to eliminate the nerve problems that she has except to try medications. Any treatment for her around the jaws or elsewhere where nerves may be stretched could end up with a similar kind of nerve outcome. The pain she experiences is very unusual and thus there may be genetic factors and her own systemic factors that are probably contributing to her current pain problems. Hopefully she will be able to tolerate the Topamax as I feel this is the medication that may help her pain levels. I just want to update you in reference to my recent conversation with B264 .\n\nI hope all is going well with you and I look forward to seeing you again soon.\nWith best regards,", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"42mm\", \"patient_age\": 59, \"maximum_opening\": \"45mm\", \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": true, \"back_pain_present\": true, \"neck_pain_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching | bruxing | left posterior crossbite | right posterior crossbite\", \"physical_therapy_status\": \"equilibrations | steroid injections to the right tmj | physical therapy since 20 years ago | massage therapies weekly | physical therapy once a week\", \"earache_present\": false, \"onset_triggers\": \"fell down 14 basement stairs and hit her head\", \"adverse_reactions\": \"environmental | ceclor | vancomycin | horse serum and any medication made from that type of serum | fluorescein dye 10% | sulfa\", \"jaw_locking\": true, \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"previous_medications\": \"lyrica | neurontin\", \"muscle_pain_score\": \"mild\", \"headache_intensity\": \"0 | present\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"age of 21\", \"jaw_crepitus\": \"right tmj\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"sleep_disorder_type\": \"sleep disorder\", \"current_medications\": \"synthroid | zetia | soma | robaxin | vitamin e | darvocet | tylenol | estrogen | ambien | desensitization injections for allergies | ticlid | cozaar | thyroid medication | corgard | robaxin | antibiotics | lidocaine cream | lidocaine gargle\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior and lateral displacement without reduction\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"right styloid area | right temporalis\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj | right tmj | left tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"splint for about 20 years | orthodontics from 15 to 10 years ago\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | back | left tmj | right tmj | neck | fingers | feet | left tmj\"}}", "prediction": ""}
{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B422", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B422 \nB422 is 21 years old and referred by Dr. XX.\nPatient History\nB422 previously has had her tonsils removed. She does have some allergy problems, and this makes her nose fairly stuffy. She did have asthma as a child but not now. She takes birth control pills but no other medication.\n\nB422 's problems began probably a couple of years ago of unknown etiology. She became aware of clicking noises in her joints particularly on the right side. This is of unknown etiology. The past four or five months she has started to get a locking problem primarily involved the right joint, where she can only open so wide and then can't open wider than that. Previous treatments that she has had include orthodontics with three sets of braces in the past. She has also undergone myofunctional therapy, and she has a night guard that she has worn for approximately two years now. This is to help control her clenching and bruxism. She does have nocturnal clenching and bruxism. The splint does disocclude the teeth, but she still clenches with that device in. She has no trouble with earaches, vertigo, or hearing loss but does get occasional tinnitus. The only other joint problem she has is some lower back problems that she feels may be related to her vertebrae. She does have a lot of allergies to environmental things such as grass, molds, mites, trees, dogs, cats, etc. She cannot wear cheap jewelry as she gets contact dermatitis with watches, braces, earrings, etc.\n\nPatient Concerns\nTeeth don't fit together very well\nTongue thrust problem\nDifficulties breathing through the nose\nClicking in the jaw joints, particularly on the right side\n\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B422 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm, and upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline. Chin may be just slightly to the right a millimeter or 2. Nasal tip is just slightly to the right 1 or 2 mm.\n\nIn profile view, she might have just some slight AP maxillary deficiency of a couple of millimeters. Chin is deficient by 10 to 12 mm. Chin-neckline is short, and chin-neck angle is not well-defined. Some fullness in the submental area is present. Does hold her head in a neck postured forward head position.\n\nIntraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding, lower anterior arch. Has some lack of attached gingiva in the lower anterior arch right adjacent to the central incisors but otherwise has adequate gingival. She occludes primarily just on the second molars bilaterally, and the rest of the teeth are essentially out of occlusion. She has about a 3-mm anterior open bite. Has a slight Class II end-on cuspid relationship being probably about 2 to 3 mm Class II. Just a slight transverse cant in the occlusion with the right side being about a millimeter lower than the left side. Anteroposteriorly, the cuspids appear to be in fairly good symmetry.\n\nTo palpation, she has no tenderness over the head and neck area to palpation. No tenderness over the TMJ areas. On opening, she has a soft opening click at about 10 to 15 mm on the right side and a closing click at about 10 to 15 mm. The left side appears fairly smooth.\n\nOropharynx appears quite clear.\nIntranasally, she has a severely deviated nasal septum off toward the left side. Left turbinate is moderately large in size. On the right side, the right inferior turbinate is moderately large in size, but she has a huge structure above the inferior turbinate that is either an extremely enlarged middle turbinate versus a nasal polyp. The superior aspect of the septum is the area that is deviated far off towards the left side, and this structure up there almost completely obliterates the nasal cavity at that level.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars, but all the rest of the teeth are present and accounted for. Sinuses look relatively clear. Deviation of the septum is not as easily identified on this film, but it does appear that she can see some of the deviation present. Inferior turbinates look relatively normal in size. Middle turbinate on the right side appears to be quite large and filling a lot of the area cavity, but the left side appears to be blocked because of the severe deviation of the septum off toward that left side. Condyles look a little bit flattened but otherwise not too bad.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses are relatively clear. Septum doesn't look too bad in this film. Airway looks reasonable particularly at the inferior turbinate level.\n\nOn the right TMJ tomogram, it appears that the mandible is maybe postured forward slightly, and the condyle may be postured down and forward from its more centric relation. It shows that there is good joint space around the joint. There appears to be anterior beaking present. The articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows that she may not be occluding together quite all the way. Joint space looks fairly good, although it appears that there have been some bony changes on the condyle. There is some anterior beaking present, and in the anteroposterior direction, the condyle appears a little bit narrow. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is good, in fact, exception translation of the condyles anterior to the articular eminences.\n\nCephalometrically, her head is tipped up somewhat. Oropharyngeal airway at the base of the tongue measures about 4 to 5 mm. This might be even less with better orientation of the head. Lips are forced together. She has an accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch and perhaps just a slight reverse curve of occlusion in the lower arch. Tongue is sitting down and does not completely fill the maxillary available volume.\n\nTooth size analysis reveals about 0.5 to 1 mm of discrepancy.\nBasic Diagnoses\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations with reductions\nAnterior maxillary excess\nPosterior vertical maxillary deficiency\nAP mandibular deficiency\nClass II end-on occlusion\nAnterior open bite\nOccluding only on maxillary and mandibular second molars\nAnterior open bite of 3 to 4 mm\nAccentuated curve of Spee in the upper arch\nSlight reversed curve of Spee in the lower arch Tooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 1 mm\nSlight over-angulation of lower incisors\nSeverely deviated nasal septum\nSeverely hypertrophied right middle turbinate versus polyp\nNasal airway obstruction\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway\n\nRecommended Treatment\nMRI of left and right TMJ\nPresurgical orthodontics\nAlign and level maxillary arch in three segments using a continuous arch wire with a vertical step.

Lateral pole of the condyle seems to extend beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Very minimal downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of probably only about 2 mm. Cortical bone on the condyle appears to be intact. There is a decreased vertical joint space particularly at the lateral rim of the fossa. There could be some medial displacement of the articular disc. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly and possibly medially displaced.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just a couple of millimeters. Appears to be a little bit greater joint space on this side as compared to the opposite side. Difficult to identify discal tissue, however. Condyle appears to extend a little bit beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Possibly could be some medial displacement of the articular disc on this side. Discal tissue appears to be anteriorly and possibly medially displaced.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is flattened anteriorly with some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Appears to be some discontinuity of the cortical bone on the top of the condyle on the anterior aspect of it. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and out laterally appears to be quite thickened in the posterior band area. However, more medial cut shows the disc is not as thickened at the posterior band as it is more laterally. Appears to be some discontinuity on the head of the condyle of the cortical bone. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. More medially, the disc appears to be in a little bit better position and appears to have less anterior dislocation. Joint space looks better balanced toward the medial aspect of the joint. There is some fluid in the superior joint space.\n\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has some peaking at the superior aspect and perhaps a little bit of loss of cortical bone on the anterior leading edge of the condyle. Articular disc is moderately steep. Appears to be some increased superior and posterior joint space. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Posterior band is slightly thickened but not as significantly as the opposite side. There is some flattening on the anterior head of the condyle and some anterior beaking as we go more medially. More medially, the disc is in a little bit better position but still in a vertical orientation within the fossa. More medially, the disc also appears to become thinner. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces.\n\nOn opening, it appears as though there is some restricted translation.\nImpression:\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 21, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": false, \"back_pain_present\": true, \"neck_pain_present\": false, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"anterior open bite | clenching | bruxism\", \"physical_therapy_status\": \"myofunctional therapy\", \"earache_present\": false, \"adverse_reactions\": \"grass | molds | mites | trees | dogs | cats | cheap jewelry\", \"jaw_locking\": true, \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"muscle_symptoms_present\": false, \"jaw_clicking\": \"left tmj | right tmj | right tmj\", \"current_appliance\": \"night guard for 2 years\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"couple of years ago\", \"current_medications\": \"birth control pills\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior dislocation with reduction | right disc anterior and possibly medial dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics with three sets of braces in the pastv\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"back\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 21, \"maximum_opening\": \"10 to 15mm\", \"diet_score\": 0, \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation | right disc dislocation | right disc dislocation | left disc dislocation | right disc dislocation | right disc dislocation | left disc dislocation | right disc dislocation | right disc dislocation | right disc dislocation | left disc dislocation | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction | left disc dislocation with reduction | right disc dislocation with reduction |"}
{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B224", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B224\nB224 is 15 years old and, referred by Dr. XXXX.\nB224 is in good health with no major medical problems.\nPRIMARY CONCERNS:\n1. Bite is shifting.\n2. Chronic mouth breather.\n3. Significant difficulties breathing through the nose.\n4. Severe snoring. He has probably moderate-to-severe snoring.\n5. Clicking and popping in the jaw joints.\n\nHISTORY: B224 may get earaches about every 3 months. He gets occasional tinnitus. He gets vertigo only when he is tired. No hearing loss. The only other joints that bother him are his knees. He is not aware of clenching and bruxism. He has some significant nasal airway obstruction. He is probably a mouth breather. He takes no medications. He rates his headaches at a level of 0, TMJ pain at 0, overall facial pain and headaches at 0, jaw function at 0, diet at 1 disability at 0. B224's TMJ problem began about 4 years ago when he was about 11 years of age. Shortly after that, he began his orthodontic treatment and has had 2 orthodontic treatments from the age of 11 years to 15 years. One time he was treated with a twin block and also he had a maxillary expander procedure done.\n\nCLINICAL EVALUATION: On frontal view, B224 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Some deviation of the nose. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 3 mm. Nasal tips off to the right side about 3 mm. Midline is off to the left about 2-1/2 to 3 mm. Mandibular dental midline is probably fairly close to being on the facial midline or maybe just about 1 mm to the left. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are pretty well aligned with the facial midline. In profile view, upper lip superlabrale is posterior to subnasale. The upper lip is probably retruded by about 4 to 6 mm. The chin is retruded by approximately 20 mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short. Chin-neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B224 has all of his lower teeth back to the second molars present. He has adequate attached gingiva though quite thin around the tooth central incisors. Also, thin around the cuspids. In the upper arch, he has all of his teeth back through the second molar. In centric relation, B224 has a Class II malocclusion about 2 mm on the left side and probably 5 to 6 mm on the right side. He has an open-bite tendency from the cuspids forward. He has about a 1 mm vertical overbite, but has an overjet of probably about 4 mm. When B224 bites his teeth together he hits prematurely on the right side. Intraorally, the oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. The uvula is moderately hyperplastic, but the soft palate is normal length and the fascial pillars look relatively normal. Intranasally, the septum appears to be deviated off towards the left side and there is a big spur at the base of the nose. Turbinates on the right side is moderately enlarged and the left side at least anteriorly is of a more normal size. B224 had a nasal injury when he was in his early grade school years where fell off some mats and hit his nose and had some significant bleeding and also hit his head. He was taken to the ER for evaluation at that time. To palpation, he has some mild tenderness over the masseter muscles. On opening, joints seem to function relatively smoothly. On excursion movement there may be a little bit of crepitation. Maximal incisal opening is 53 mm. Excursion movement to the right is about 4 mm, to the left 8 mm. Transverse cant and maxilla are relatively level.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n: Panorex shows the presence of all four third molars impacted and the lowers are trapped beneath the distal aspect of the crowns on the second molars. Sinuses appear relatively clear as best as be evaluated from these photos.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears narrow anteroposteriorly. Difficult to see the cortical bone across the top of the condyle. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa with significantly increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination to it.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is somewhat flattened on top and posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is steeper than the opposite side. It is difficult to identify the cortical bone on top of the condyle, but a little more legible then the opposite side. On opening, there is adequate translation in both joints, but the condyles do not quite clear the articular eminence.\n\nWaters view shows that that the left maxillary sinus is fairly opaque, particularly probably a sinusitis occurring in that sinus at the time. Right sinus is clear. There is significant deviation and a huge septal spur off the left side of the septum that actually goes over and almost touches against the lateral nasal wall. Turbinate on the right appears quite large. Turbinate on the left side is pretty much obliterated by the large septal spur.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows slight anterior vertical maxillary excess and posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. The mandible is AP deficient and there is a skeletal Class II and an occlusal Class II jaw relationship. He has a fairly large adenoid mass in the nasopharynx and an AOA dimension of about 3.5 mm between the turbinate and the adenoid tissue. Airway at the base of the soft palate measures about 6 mm and the base of tongue measures about 7.5 mm. There is no significant tooth size discrepancy.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES:\n1. Bilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and articular disc dislocations without reduction.\n2. AP maxillary deficiency.\n3. Posterior vertical maxillary deficiency.\n4. AP mandibular deficiency.\n5. Class II occlusion.\n6. Maxillary midline shifted 2 to 3 mm to the left of the facial midline.\n7. Anterior open bite.\n8. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.\n9. Severely deviated nasal septum with large septal spur obliterating the left nasal airway passage.\n10. Bilateral hypertrophied turbinates.\n11. Nasopharyngeal adenoid hyperplasia.\n12. Wide columella creating narrow nostrils.\n13. High-occlusal plane angle.\n14. Back to maxillary mandibular third molars x4.\n15. Sleep apnea symptoms.\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\n1. Surgery stage I. a. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.\n2. Monitor facial growth and development.\n3. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b. Slenderize lower anterior teeth removing 1 to 2 mm of tooth structure and retract, but be careful not to remove any more than 2 mm of tooth structure.\n3. Surgery stage II. a. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior maxillary superiorly, downward at the posterior aspect, upright the incisors and decrease the occlusal plane angle. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counter-\nclockwise direction. c. Nasoseptoplasty. d. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. e. Removal of nasopharyngeal adenoid mass. f. Surgical removal of bone impacted third molars.\n4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB224\nMRI Evaluation\nDate of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have perhaps some loss of integrity on the cortical bone underneath the condyle. Quality is either very poor or he is having some significant degenerative changes in the bone structure of the mandibular condyle. Decrease in superior joint space is present. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a moderate amount. Cortical bone appears somewhat irregular on the head of the condyle. Disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. Appears there may have been some condylar resorption present.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that shows up a little better on the imaging as compared to the opposite side. There is fairly good mediolateral width. Decreased superior joint space particularly at the lateral aspect of the condyle and the medial aspect of the condyle. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. Condyle appears somewhat flattened. Appears there may have been some condylar resorption present.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view show a condyle that appears to have lost some volume and some vertical height. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa and appears to be some loss of vertical height of the joint space. Articular eminence is quite long and moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and actually sitting beneath the articular eminence. Condyle appears to be extremely narrow towards the medial aspect of the joint. It appears small compared to the size of the fossa. Disc is somewhat deformed. It appears to be shortened anteroposteriorly and a little bit thickened. It appears to have lost the intermediate zone. In some areas, there appears to be amorphous tissue in the joint space. On opening, there is significantly restricted translation and the disc appears nonreducing. Disc may be adhesed to the articular eminence.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle is a little bit larger on this side than the opposite side. However, the bone particularly towards the medial side of the joint appears to have resorbed somewhat. Some anterior beaking is present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Decreased posterior joint space. This is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. Disc is short anteroposteriorly and thickened. There may be amorphous type of material surrounding the condyle. On opening, the condyle has restricted translation although slightly more than the opposite side and the disc remains nonreducing.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B199", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B199\nB199 is 25 years old. B199 was referred here by Dr. XXXX. B199 has been aware of having TMJ problems since about the age of 10 years old. It did not really become a significant issue until she was about 20 years old when her pain levels began to escalate fairly significantly. Primary concerns B199 has at this time include the following:\n\nTMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain. Difficulties eating and chewing. Difficulties breathing through the nose creating predominantly mouth breathing. Teeth and jaws do not fit together.\nShe does at times get twitching of her facial muscles.\n\nB199's initial problems began at the age of 10 and could have been induced by a lot of stress that she was under at that time or other factors. Following the escalation of her pain and headaches at the age of 20, she has undergone some significant treatment attempts. This includes the following:\n\nUpper and lower jaw splint devices that I have not seen before that she wore for 1 year. Since age 22, she has had 4 additional splints. She basically wears through them and then requires new ones to be made. Acupuncture last year for a few months.\nShe has seen 2 different chiropractic doctors between ages 21 and 23 for treatments without any successful improvement. She had physical therapy for the past year, again without any significant improvement.\n\nB199 rates her headaches at a level of 6 throughout her head area that is fairly constant and can exacerbate to a level of 8 to 9. She rates her TMJ pain at 7, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 5, diet at 5, and disability at 8. The only medication she currently takes is Motrin, although she has tried Vicodin and pain medications with codeine that have been ineffectual for her. She gets earaches occasionally, no tinnitus, but vertigo with no hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her knees, hips, ankles, and possibly her neck vertebrae. She is aware of clenching her teeth at night time and also during the day.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B199 has fairly good facial symmetry in the upper and lower third face, and there may be some slight asymmetry in the mandible. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 5 mm. The maxillary dental midline is just slightly off to the right side about 1 mm. The mandibular dental midline is about 2 mm off to the right side, and the chin is probably 2 to 3 mm off to the right side. B199 has about 12 mm of lip incompetence. In profile view, B199 has some slight AP maxillary deficiency of probably about 3-4 mm. The chin is retruded by about 18 mm. Lower third face appears elongated. She has a high occlusal plane angle mandibular morphology. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Lower molars are tipped lingually along the right bicuspid slightly. She has a transverse and narrow lower arch. She has some mild crowding of the lower anterior arch, but has good attached gingiva. There is a slight accentuated curve of Spee in the lower arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has a slight reverse curve of Wilson present. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal in structure and in health. Intranasally, as best I could see, the septum appears reasonably straight. The turbinates appear moderate in size particularly on the left side. The right one is not quite as large as the left one. B199 has a Class III cuspid relationship bilaterally by probably 3 mm or so. She has an anterior open bite. She has an end-on incisor AP relationship and posteriorly it appears that the maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth are tipped lingually. Her Class III occlusion appears to be splint induced. She does have a slight transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being about 1 to 1.5 mm lower than the left side. The mandibular left cuspid is about 1 or 2 mm posterior to the right cuspid. To palpation, she has moderate to high moderate pain throughout the head and neck area with the worse being in the TMJ area and the shoulder area. On opening, she does have a click in the right joint at about 30 mm of opening and a closing click at 15 mm. The left side functions reasonably smoothly, although she feels sort of like a rubbing kind of noise on the left side. On opening, the mandible does shift off towards the right side about 3-4 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the presence of all teeth actually erupted in including the third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. It is difficult to evaluate the TMJ joints. Styloid processes are moderately long. Coronal view shows that she does have enlarged turbinates that fill most of the nasal cavity with the right side being worse than the left side. Septum appears reasonably straight and sinuses appear relatively clear. Axial view also shows that anteriorly the turbinates have been reduced particularly on the left side, but posteriorly the turbinates are quite large particularly on the right side. Sinuses are clear. Left TMJ coronal view shows condyle that appears to have a reasonable shape to it. It may be a little bit narrow mediolaterally. Joint space vertically is reasonable except at the lateral rim of the fossa where it is a little bit narrow. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears slightly smaller than the opposite side. Joint space appears fairly well balance. There is a little bit decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint perhaps in one view. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa in some of the views. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. A little sclerosis on the head of the condyle. There may be a little flattening of the condyle in the superior aspect towards the lateral aspect of the joint.\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a pseudocyst in the head. There is some anterior beaking present, and there actually appears to be a decreased anterior joint space between the articular eminence and the condyle. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B199 has a moderately high occlusal plane angle, a Class III occlusion with a Class II skeletal relationship. She has anterior vertical maxillary excess and AP mandibular deficiency. The airway space appears somewhat constricted with it being about 10 mm at the soft palate and at the base of the tongue measures about 8 mm down to less than 4 mm of airway space. She has a significant lip incompetence with anterior vertical maxillary excess. Maximal incisal opening is 46 mm, opening without discomfort 28 mm. Excursion movement to the right 7 mm, to the left 6 mm.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B199 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction on the right side and without reduction on the left side. AP vertical maxillary hyperplasia, but AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.\nAP mandibular hypoplasia, but anterior vertical hyperplasia.\nAnterior open bite. Class III occlusion. High occlusal plane angle.\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3 mm at the base of the tongue (normal dimension 11 mm).\nTMJ pain. Myofascial pain. Headaches. Hypertrophied turbinates creating nasal airway obstruction.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nMRI of left and right TMJ. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisors roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies if they are necessary. Align and level mandibular arch. Try to expand the arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing no more than 2 mm to correct for a 1.5 to 2 mm tooth size discrepancy. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).\nSurgical option 1. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction. Bilateral coronoidotomies. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen).\nBilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Anterior mandibular ostectomy to advance the chin forward and reduce it vertically. Consider removing the third molars.\nSurgical option 2.\nBilateral TMJ disc repositioning and stabilization with Mitek anchors. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla in a counterclockwise direction.\nBilateral turbinectomies.\nConsider possible removal of third molars. Anterior mandibular ostectomy to advance the chin forward and reduce it vertically. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB199 MRI AGE: 25/F\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be discal tissue in the joint area with some what appears to be lateral disc displacement. It is difficult to tell whether it is anterior or posteriorly. There is good condylar width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle is just slightly smaller than the left side. There appears to be discal tissue displaced laterally, but also it appears that there may be some tissue medially as well. Joint space appears reasonably good. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. A little sclerosis on the top. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and significantly degenerated and deformed. It is quite short anteroposteriorly. The posterior band is quite thickened. Intermediate zone is extremely short. There is fluid in the superior joint space. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence. On opening, this side seems to have moderately good translation with the disc in position. The disc appears to move with the condyle.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have some arthritic changes with some areas that appear like small erosive areas on the anterior and superior head of the condyle. It appears that there is discal tissue that is degenerated, but in position. What appears to be the posterior band is of relatively normal thickness. Intermediate zone appears to be degenerated as does the posterior disc. Anterior band appears fairly dense. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. The right TMJ appears to have anteriorly displaced disc that is nonreducing, although there is reasonably good translation of the condyle. The disc remains thickened, deformed, and degenerated.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with significant deformation and nonreducing.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B508", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B508\nB508 is 16 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. B508 has had her wisdom teeth removed and had left second premolar and mandibular right second premolars extracted 4 months ago. She had her wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. B508 is in good health with no major medical problems. She is 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds.\n\nPRIMARY CONCERNS:\nBreathing difficulties.\nDifficulty eating. Difficulty talking. Pain in the jaw joints. Headaches. Difficulties eating and chewing. Noises in the jaw joints.\nDifficulty breathing through her nose.\n\nCurrently B508 takes no medications.\nIn frontal view, B508 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. She has a little bit of increased fullness in the right cheek area. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship is about 4 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the fascial midline. Mandibular dental midline is probably about 3 to 4 mm off to the left side and the chin is probably 5 mm off the left side. As B508 bites her teeth together, she tends to shift off towards to the right side a greater amount than her centric relation. In centric relation she is still off to the right about 3 mm. Upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably about 2 mm. The maxilla is retruded by about 4 to 5 mm. Chin is AP deficient by approximately 15 mm. B508 has a head postured forward neck position, Intraorally, she is missing lower second bicuspids. She has some moderate crowding in the lower anterior arch. There is a high attached labial frenulum but otherwise appears to have good attached gingiva. In the upper arch she appears to be missing first bicuspids but has the rest of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an anterior open bite of about 5 mm. On the right side she has a crossbite and a tendency towards a crossbite on the left side. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the left side about 2 mm and on the right side she is probably 4 to 5 mm Class II. Open bite in the cuspid area on the left side is greater than the right side by probably a couple of mm. Transversely the maxillary occlusal plane is fairly level. However, there is asymmetry in the lower arch with a transverse cant and the left side is 2 mm lower than the right side. Mandibular dental midline and chin are fairly closely aligned to each other. She bites primarily on just the second molars bilaterally with the rest of the teeth essentially being out of occlusion. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal. The uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars all appear relatively normal. Intranasally, she has moderately enlarged turbinates and they may be larger posteriorly. The septum has some deviations to it with accepted norms. Moderate nasal airway obstruction. Columella is somewhat wide and nostrils are a little bit narrow. However, opening the nostrils with a scope did not appear to improve her ability to breathe through her nose.\n\nShe does report mild snoring and mild daytime somnolence but no sleep apnea syndrome problems. Maxillary incisal opening is about 49 mm, excursive moves are approximately 7 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n:\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars as well as mandibular second bicuspids and maxillary first bicuspids. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size. The bony septum appears relatively straight. Condyles appear arthritic particularly on the right side. She has a root canal in the mandibular right first molar.\n\nWater view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear. The bony septum at least appears relatively straight. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged with somewhat constricted airway.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram is a little hard to interpret but it appears there are arthritic changes in the joints and moderately flat articular eminence. There maybe some decreased joint space present.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have some less arthritic changes compared to the opposite side. Joint space appears a little bit better balanced. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both condyles coming down beneath the articular eminences.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B508 has a high occlusal plane angle, Class II skeletal and occlusal relationship and a significant anterior open bite of almost 7 mm. Oropharyngeal airway is constricted with a dimension from the soft palate to posterior pharyngeal wall of about 5 mm and at the base of the tongue about 4 mm. She has lip incompetence of about 8 mm.\n\nB508 believes her problems began perhaps when she was about 11 years of age. She may have had some clicking and popping in her jaw joints at that time of unknown etiology. Except for initiating the orthodontic treatment she has had no other treatment for her joint problems.\n\nDental model analysis reveals a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm. She has a significant accentuated curve of occlusion primarily related to the second molars being quite a bit higher than the rest of the teeth. The first molars are also slightly elevated. The lower arch has a slight accentuated curve of occlusion associated with it but not too significant. Dental model analysis also reveals transverse maxillary deficiency. B508 does require 10 to 11 hours of sleep a night in order to feel good. This is probably related to the constricture of the oropharyngeal airway. She also has the abnormal head and neck posture that helps open up her airway and does improve her breathing some. However, she is developing curvature in the shoulders and abnormal neck shape and posture.\n\nB508\nBASIC DIAGNOSES:\nBilateral TMJ idiopathic condylar resorption and articular disc dislocations with the right side significantly worse than the left side.\nAP mandibular deficiency. Anterior vertical maxillary excess.\nAP maxillary deficiency. Transverse maxillary deficiency. Mandible deviated off to the right side approximately 3 to 4 mm. Class II end-on occlusion being worse on the right side than the left side.\nBilateral posterior crossbites being worse on the right side than the left side.\nTransverse cant in the mandibular occlusal plane with the left side being 2 mm lower than the right side. Occluding predominately only on the second molars bilaterally. Hypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. Significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway of 4 mm (normal 11 mm.) Snoring. Daytime somnolence. Speech deformity. Masticatory dysfunction. High occlusal plane angulation.\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nContinue to align and level maxillary arch. Open a little bit of spacing around the upper laterals and cuspids to equal about 0.5 to 1 mm to correct for the tooth size discrepancy. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Try to lose significant posterior anchorage so that the lower incisors do not retract at all. In fact they could benefit by being tipped forward slightly. Surgery stage I:\nBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Surgery stage II:\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to expand, advance and level the occlusal plane.\nPartial turbinectomy. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB508 MRI Evaluation \nAge: 16/F\nDate of Birth: \nDate of Acquisition:\nDate of Interpretation:\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have reasonably good mediolateral width although there appears that there are some arthritic changes within the joint. Decreased lateral joint space. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. There may be discal tissue over medial.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost some volume vertically. The condyle appears more deformed than the opposite side. The joint space actually looks very good. Cortical bone appears to be intact. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears there may be some discal tissue displaced laterally.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have some arthritic changes. There is a little bit of flattening on the head of the condyle. It is difficult to see the cortical bone over the top of the condyle. At the lateral aspect of the joint it appears that the disc is anteriorly displaced but towards the medial side the disc appears to be in better position although there may be degenerative changes associated with the disc. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc appears to reduce and there appears to be moderate translation of the condyle and the disc.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of anterior beaking and flattening on the head of the condyle. There appears to be some loss of volume to the condyle. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination. Articular disc appears to anteriorly displaced and it is more visible at the lateral aspect of the joint than at the medial. A little bit of fluid present in the superior joint space. On opening there is restricted translation of the condyle and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. The disc appears fairly deformed and degenerated. There is questionable salvageability of this disc but it still may be salvageable.\n\nIMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint.

In profile, she has fairly vertical and AP facial balance. Intraorally, she has upper and lower full dentures and she has a lower splint. Oropharyngeal airway tissues look relatively normal. She has some mild snoring, but no daytime somnolence and no sleep apnea symptoms. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseter muscle and high moderate pain over the TMJs. The styloid area has milder tenderness. She is unaware of clenching her teeth.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows that B274 is totally edentulous. There are some arthritic changes probably in her joints. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There appears to be some decreased vertical and articular anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There seems to be increased anterior joint space. On opening, there is some restricted translation bilaterally. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has basically a skeletal Class I jaw relationship. Oropharyngeal airway appears reasonable with about 8-9 mm airway space at the soft palate level and about 7-8 mm airway space at the base of tongue. However, she is holding her tongue down in her mouth when this x-ray was taken. Basic diagnoses for B274 are as follows:\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction. TMJ pain. Headaches. Myofascial pain.\nEaraches, tinnitus, and vertigo.\nTotally edentulous.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nSurgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors. Reconstruction of dentures.\n\nWith this approach of placing the discs back in position, it would shift the mandible out of position. B274 will need reconstruction of her dentures post-surgery. They understand this. I believe that this procedure will give her the best chance of getting rid of her headaches, TMJ pain, myofascial pain, and ear symptoms, although they understand there is no guarantee that this will eliminate these problems. She has been under treatment with Dr. __ for some time now without significant improvement. She has tried conservative treatment unsuccessfully.\n\nB274  MRI EVALUATION \nAGE: DOB:\nDate of Acquisition: \nDate of Interpretation: \nLeft TMJ coronal views shows a condyle that a little sclerosis on the top. Joint space could be a little bit compressed. The disc may be anteromedially displaced. The lateral rim curves inferiorly 1 mm or so.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width and some sclerosis on top. The disc appears to be medially displaced. There is decreased lateral joint space.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present. Some flattening on the superior head and perhaps a small erosion in this area. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and in a vertical orientation. There is decreased posterior joint space. The disc may be acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posteriorly. There is a little bit of fluid in the inferior joint space. Unfortunately, there are no open views so difficult to tell if there is reduction of the disc on opening.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is a little bit sclerotic on top. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The articular disc appears anteriorly displaced, but appears to be an early reduction on opening. There is decreased posterior joint space and superior joint space. Disc appears somewhat thickened.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated, but appears that there would be early reduction in both joints.\nB274 \n\nThe patient presents for final presurgical workup. Final records were taken at her last appointment here. History and physical performed today. Consent form reviewed and signed. I did my final examination. I answered all the questions she and her husband had. B274 states that she has drainage from her ears and odor from her ears. Examination shows that her ears are very clear with no evidence of infection or other problems. No drainage is seen. Tympanic membranes appear clear, although a little bit sclerotic on the right side. I did not notice any odor emitting from her ears. She is ready for surgery tomorrow.\n\nB274 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. She looks good. She has a smile on her face. Her severe headaches are not present any more. She is feeling much more comfortable. A little bit of tenderness and soreness in the temple areas. Today I removed her sutures. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She says she has felt the best that she has in the past 5 years. She is doing very well and return to see me in 3 months.\n\nB274 \nTelephone conversation with her. She is doing fairly well. She has some tenderness in her joints as expected and makes noises particularly when she yawns. I told her that that is fairly normal and that she should not be overly concerned about that at this time. She is to keep me informed of her progress.\n\nB274 \nThe patient presents for a followup evaluation. She is now a little bit over 3 months postsurgery. She had done fairly good. Her headaches have dropped down to a level of 5 on that left side. She only gets occasional pain in the jaw joints. She has some minor complaints, but nothing real significant. To palpation, she has some moderate tenderness in one spot over the left temporalis muscle, but relatively minimal tenderness over the left masseter and bilateral TMJs. She gets occasional left-sided earaches and still gets some tinnitus, but no vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her hips, back, elbows, and wrists. She takes the following medications:\n\nCymbalta 60 mg q.d.\nActonel 30 mg weekly.\nNexium 40 mg q.d.\nGold shots periodically.\nFish oil.\nHer occlusion looks good. We took some x-rays today and joint spaces look well balanced bilaterally. She appears to be progressing well, is in good spirits, and is very thankful for the improvement she has had so far. She is to return to see me in 3 months.\n\nB274 \nTelephone conversation with Dr. __ . She has cataracts and he wants to do surgery on her and she is allergic to lidocaine. He wanted to know if she could be intubated. Her surgery was about 5 to 6 months ago. I told him as long as the anesthesiologists were gentle with her jaws and jaw joints that I do not see a problem with that. She is edentulous and it appears that she should be a relatively easy intubation. They will try to do with her a laryngeal mask kind of technique so that they do not actually have to intubate her, but if they do need to intubate I told him I felt it be fine as long as they were reasonably gentle with her.\n\nB274 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient is significantly improved, but still having some problems, predominantly on the left side. She gets some pain in the left temporal area just above the arch and just above the joint area. This is about a level of 6. She apparently does not have any pain directly in the joint itself. To palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the masseter muscle, but not directly over the joints. She has some tenderness over the left shoulder. She takes the following medications:\n\nCymbalta 60 mg q.d.\nActonel 30 mg each week.\nNexium 40 mg q.d.\nGold shots.\nHer arthritis in her joints is apparently doing better, and she is not having much joint problems except I believe for her right little finger that she fell and broke. It is a little bit tender for her. Her incisal opening is 30 mm. She feels as though her ear canal closes on the left side, and it may be due to the fact that the disc is back in position and she still has some inflammation that causes some swelling in the area. She has tried some medications with Dr. __ that did not agree with her. Will try to get those records from Dr. __ . There are some medicines she cannot take. She can take Excedrin. I suggested she take Excedrin two times a day to see if this will help settle the inflammation and help her feel better. She also has some problems with her vertical dimension, and she over closes currently and this may contribute some to her muscle tenderness. Overall, she is improved. She is only 6 months postsurgery and still in the healing process. She is to call me in 2 weeks to let me know how she is doing.\n\nB274\nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. Her occlusion is good. Incisal opening is about 35 mm with a little bit of help. Her occlusion looks stable. She has some different symptoms and feels that her back teeth are not as far apart as they should be when she opens, but to me it looks like things function fairly well. She has about 3 mm of excursion movement in each direction. To palpation, she has no pain over the joints and just very minimal tenderness over the temporalis, particularly on the left side, and the left medial pterygoid area. For the most part, she seems to be progressing well, although psychologically she appears to be improving more slowly. She does get some headaches in the left temporal area. Otherwise, she seems to be progressing well. We will try to set her up with the CMP clinic to see if they can make dentures for her at the dental school. She is to return to see me in about 3 to 4 months for a year followup.\n\nB274 \nB274 presents for followup evaluation. She is now about 14 months post bilateral TMJ articular discs repositioning with Mitek anchors. She continues to have some problems. She gets some pain predominantly in the left TMJ area and ear area. Incisal opening is 33 mm. I forgot to measure her side-to-side movement. She gets headaches on the left side in the frontal and temporal area at about a level of 3. She gets some TMJ pain at about a level of 3 and average daily pain at 5. She rates her jaw function at 0, diet at 4, disability at 3. She actually has fairly good side-to-side movement, but I forgot to measure it. To palpation, she has rather severe pain over the temporalis muscles, but relatively minimal to mild tenderness over the rest of the head and neck areas. She has no earaches, but gets tinnitus, left side worse than the right side, and she gets some vertigo. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She does get some sharp pains into her ears particularly on the left side, but not earaches per se.\n\nThe last time she was here I had suggested that she go to the CFP Clinic to have her dentures constructed. This was done, but she found the dentures uncomfortable. She went back to her original dentist who made her a new set of dentures. These fit together pretty well and are more comfortable than the previous set, but she feels as though her tongue is squashed down and flattened and there is no room for her tongue. She also gets some tissue trapped between the dentures of the left side which is basically cheek tissue which she feels has fallen down and gets between her dentures. She feels that her back teeth may be down too far. I explained to her that the resorption of the alveolar ridges, particularly in the upper arch, is what has caused the palate to be so flat as the vertical height of the alveolar ridges decreases, the palate will relatively seem flatter. I am not sure how to remedy this situation for her except to have the upper denture remade bringing it down further vertically and trying to thin the palate on the denture as much as possible. A second alternative would be to do sinus lifts with bone grafting and placement of osteointegrated implants so that the upper denture could be made to palatal coverage.\n\nRadiographically, with the tomograms, she has good joint spaces in the coronal and sagittal views indicative of the discs being in proper position.\nWhen she bites her teeth together, she tends to get dystonic jaw movements. I suggested that she take magnesium 3 tablets in the morning and 3 tablets in the evening to see if this will help quiet this down. An additional alternative may be to try perhaps Klonopin 0.5 mg once or twice during the day to see if this would help quiet the muscles down. At this time, we will just start with the magnesium. She is to keep me informed of her progress.\n\nB274 \nShe presents for further evaluation. I earlier talked to Dr. __  in reference to her. He likes the teeth she is currently wearing, although they do need some adjustment that he will be willing to do. The other set of teeth made by Dr. __  Dr. __ does not like as well. He feels she is over closed too much with those. She still has her muscular dystonia with constant movement of her jaw and facial muscles.\n\nShe had problems with the magnesium as it gave her diarrhea and an upset stomach, although initially when she first started taking it, she felt significantly improved. She now has stopped taking it, because even at one tablet she continued to have problems with diarrhea and feeling weak. She continues to complain of pain around her ears and that she feels as though her ear is closed off on the left side, though clinically the ear passage appears relatively normal. She pushes on the back side of the condyle from inside her ear and she says it makes it feel better and then she also can push back on the posterior aspect of the external meatus and it feels better for her at times. At times, her husband is saying that she is clenching and grinding her teeth.\n\nAt this time, I decided to start her on another medication, Klonopin 0.5-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x5. We will try the Klonopin and see how it works. We may have to increase the dose or even decrease it some depending on how she responds to it. She states that she has been to several neurologists and they have tried her on various medications, but nothing has really helped her, but most of that was before I did surgery on her. She believes she feels much better since surgery, but still has some difficulties. She does take Prozac, and this may be one of those medications that may cause muscular dystonia type functions. I suggested we try to taper off the Prozac, but try the Klonopin and see what difference this makes. She is to call me in 4 days to let me know how she does.\n\nB274 \nShe presents for followup evaluation. She had 2 weeks that were very good, but then yesterday she was at some kind of blue grass concert and she was leaning her head forward for a while and this set off some muscle problems for her. She is having difficulty with her dentures. One set fits better than the other. I told her to wear the set that feels the best. She feels better than before the surgery, but still has some issues. Her muscular dystonia may be affecting her. I suggested she try the Klonopin again to see if this makes a difference. She is to keep me informed of her progress.\n\nB274 \nX-rays show that there appears to be good space that would be adequate for the discs. She is taking Prozac right now. Apparently, she has elected not to get off of that as I had suggested before. In fact, she had a couple of good weeks and we are going to try the following plan:\n\nMagnesium. Take 1 tablet in the morning for 1 week.\nAdd a second tablet after 1 week at night.\nIf this does not work, then consider taking the Klonopin again. She essentially has not taken the Klonopin as prescribed, but takes it only once in a while. Therefore, we do not know if this is effective for her or not.\n\nIf we need to reinitiate the Klonopin and it is ineffective, then another medication we could consider would be thorazine. We will see how she progresses. She is to call me in 3-4 weeks.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 69, \"maximum_opening\": \"33mm | 35mm\", \"diet_score\": 4, \"disability_rating\": \"3 | 8 but today is 2\", \"jaw_function_score\": \"0 | 3\", \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"back_pain_present\": true, \"earache_present\": \"false | true\", \"onset_triggers\": \"teeth extraction\", \"adverse_reactions\": \"number of medications\", \"headache_frequency\": \"last 2 to 3 weeks\", \"pain_frequency\": \"occasional\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"muscle_pain_score\": \"left temporalis | left masseters | minimal | moderate to mild | severe\", \"headache_location\": \"left frontal | left temporal | left side\", \"current_appliance\": \"dentures | splints\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": \"10 but today is 2 | 5\", \"headache_intensity\": \"10 but today is 2 | 3 | 5 | present\", \"autoimmune_condition\": \"rheumatoid arthritis\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"64 years of age\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": \"3 | 5\", \"sleep_disorder_type\": \"snoring\", \"current_medications\": \"cymbalta | actonel | nexium | gold shots | cymbalta | actonel | nexium | gold shots | fish oil | cymbalta | actonel | nexium | senna soft gels | refresh celluvisc | calcium | alprazolam | myochrysine | fish oil | valium | prozac\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior dislocation with early reduction | right disc anterior dislocation with early reduction\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"left temporalis| masseter | left shoulder | moderate to minimal | styloid | masseter | temporalis\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"hips | back | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | hips | back | elbow | wrists\"}}", "prediction": ""}
{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B269", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B269 \nB269 is 46 years old, referred by Dr. __. B269 has had previous surgery which include 19 years ago she had a herniated discs at L4 and L5 repaired. Earlier this year she had a hammertoe surgery on the right foot. By history, B269's problems began about 4-1/2 weeks ago of unknown etiology. However, about a year ago she and her husband were hiking and they were carrying something heavy and they slipped and fell and he accidentally kicked her in the jaw area. Her jaw was a little bit stiff and sore for about 3 days and then that dissipated and she had no further problem until this recent episode. Initially she went to an emergency-type room and they placed her on some antibiotics and muscle relaxant (Norflex.) She then developed some high blood pressure and was placed in the hospital for about 4 days because her jaws kept closing down to where she could not get her medications in and had significant difficulty eating and chewing. Her muscles would go into a spasm. Finally, she was injected with some local anesthesia into the masseter muscles on the anterior edge and this helped relieve her. The injections were done just on the right side. B269 believes that most of her problems are on the right side as best as she can tell. Following the injections of the right masseter muscle, she feels as though she is locked in her TMJs. She is currently taking Norflex 100 mg b.i.d. and lisinopril 5 mg q.d.\n\nPRIMARY CONCERNS\nSevere limitation of jaw function.\nDifficulties eating and chewing.\nStiffness in the jaws.\nShe has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her at this time. She has hayfever and did have an adverse reaction to Benadryl recently, but no other known food or medication allergies. She is not aware of any problems with jewelry either. Chewing does cause stiffness and discomfort in her jaws. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism. She has lost 10 pounds in the last 4-1/2 weeks. She really has no problems with headaches. She is not aware of having any specific TMJ pain. She does get discomfort in her jaw muscles mainly on the right side at a level of 4. She feels it could possibly go up in the joint, but she cannot differentiate between joint discomfort and the muscle discomfort. Therefore, she may have TMJ discomfort to a level of 4. She rates her jaw function, diet and disability all at 7.\n\nIn frontal view, B269 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3 mm. In profile, B269 has good facial balance and symmetry. Intraorally, B269 has missing mandibular first bicuspids. She has all of her upper teeth back through the second molars. She had a division II malocclusion. She has Class II end-on cuspid relationship and an anterior deep bite probably of 7 or 8 mm. Maximal incisal opening is 22 mm counting the vertical overbite. There appears to be overjet of 3 to 4 mm in each direction. With a little digital help, B269 was able to go to the right about 9 mm and to the left about 6 mm. I was able to get her up by getting her to relax to almost 30 mm. During that relaxing, trying to stretch episode, she had significant tightness and soreness on the right side over the masseter muscle more so than in the joint itself.\n\nB269  Page 2\nWith the ability to go 9 mm to the right and 6 mm to the left, there is definitely not an ankylosis in the joint and it appears that her problems are more muscle related, although the muscle problems could be stimulated from the TMJ pathology.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows that B269 actually had her bilateral mandibular second bicuspid extracted. She has the rest of her teeth back through the third molars present. In the upper arch, she is missing third molars. Apparently, the lower second bicuspids were congenitally missing. Sinuses look clear. The condyles actually look relatively normal as best as can be seen in that particular view.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good shape. Articular eminence is relatively steep. Joint space looks reasonably good. Styloid process is slightly elongated, but not real significant.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears appropriate in size for the fossa. There may be a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. There is joint space all the way around that could be slightly decreased perhaps. On one of the tomograms, there appears to be a section of bone that comes out and overlaps the condyle and seems to extrude from around the external meatus area. On the right tomogram there does appear to be some heterotopic bone overlapping the posterior aspect of the condylar head extruding from the posterior fossa area. Styloid process also has a slightly elongated ligament as best as I can see on the tomogram. B269 has no problems, however, in all movements of the neck in both flexion and extension as well as rotation and tipping. She has no difficulties swallowing and has no pain down through the neck or throat area.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses are clear. Turbinates appear relatively normal in size and it appears that it is probably an adequate airway.\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has some slight AP mandibular deficiency and a little bit of a high occlusal plane angle. She has an anterior deep bite of only about 8 mm. Upper incisors are in a division II position and have a decreased axial angulation. Oropharyngeal airway looks adequate.\n\nI gave B269 a prescription for Klonopin 1 mg tablet dispending 10 tablets 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x2. I also gave her a prescription for a CT scan of the bilateral TMJs, ears and temple bone area to include axial views, coronal views and sagittal views.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES Severe limited jaw opening.\nRight masseter muscle myositis and dyskinesia.\nCalcified mass, right TMJ/ear/temple area.\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc disloction.\nB269  Page 3\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT\nCT scan of TMJs, temple and ear area.\nKlonopin 1 mg tablet q.h.s. to see if this will decrease muscle dysfunction.\nPresurgical Orthodontics.\n\nAlign and level the maxillary arch.\nAlign and level the mandibular arch.\nSurgery.\nConsider removal of calcified mass around the right TMJ, ear and temple area if CT scan proves abnormal enlargement and impingement. Consider possible articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors if direct examination shows disc displacement.\nPost Surgical Orthodontics a. Finish and retain\n\nB269  MRI Evaluation\nAge: 46-year-old female.\nDate of acquisition: \nDate of interpretation:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has very good mediolateral width. Cortex appears to be intact across the head of the condyle. Fossa appears to be intact. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. It is difficult to identify the discal tissues. Joint space appears to be decreased.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is a little bit more narrow than the opposite side, but not too much. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly a little greater amount than the opposite side. Joint space appears to be decreased at the lateral rim of the fossa. Cortical bone structures appear to be intact. Disc may be medially displaced. There appears to be heterotopic bone overlying the right joint including coming down below the head of the condyle, down the neck and up above the arch.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some superior peaking of the condyle and decreased superior and joint space particularly at the lateral margin of the fossa. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular is in the vertical orientation probably functioning as a wedge displaced in the condyle posteriorly. There is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle particularly involving he osteophyte sticking out along the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the disc is more difficult to identify. It is possible that this disc may be laterally displaced although reviewing the coronal views again, there possibly could be lateral displacement of the disc. On the open views, there is very restricted translation of the condyle and discs. Condyle may come forward a couple of mm. There may be some inflammation around the joint, but not a real significant. No fluid seen in the joint space.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes associated with it. There is some flattening on the posterior head and there is actually an osteophyte sticking out from the posterior head of the condyle in one area. There is some anterior beaking present on the head of the condyle as well. Also, there is some peaking on the top part of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is vertically oriented and anteriorly displaced more so towards the medial side of the joint as compared to the lateral. There is a little bit of sclerosis on the top of the condyle. On opening, there is virtually no translation of the condyle, though the disc does appear to be in position in some of the views on opening. Decreased translation could possibly mean adhesions within the joint spaces. Need to correlate this to clinical evaluation. There does not appear to be any significant inflammatory process around the joint.\n\nIMPRESSION Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocated anteriorly and perhaps laterally with minimal translation of the condyle and disc.\nRight TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced in a vertical orientation with minimal translation.\nDiscs appear salvageable depending on correlation of jaw function with the clinical evaluation. Possible heterotopic bone formation over the right TMJ.\n\nB269 CT \nDate of Acquisition: \nDate of Interpretation: \nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes associated with it. The cortical bone is intact across the head of the condyle. Decreased superior and medial joint spaces. Cortical bone in the fossa appears to be intact with some relatively minimal downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa, but decreased joint space there as well.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit more arthritic. The superior surface has some slight irregularity, but not much. Decreased superior and medial joint spaces. In both joints, the medial wall of the fossa seems to curve inferiorly quite significantly.\n\n3D assessment shows from a posterior view, that the styloid processes are moderately long being greater on the left side than the right side. Condyles appear to have a good width.\n\nLeft TMJ lateral view shows moderately long styloid processes. The condyle appears to have reasonable morphology, but the joint space looks narrowed superiorly, but this is probably not the best to determine joint space. The condyle appears to be sitting forward slightly in the fossa. The view of the left TMJ shows the condyle has good mediolateral width.\n\nRight TMJ basically likewise shows good width of the condyle. The right joint appears to have fairly good morphology, but there seems to be limited joint space. But again, this may not be the best view to evaluate joint space.\n\nIn the coronal view, the styloid processes look longer than normal.\nIMPRESSION: Arthritic changes in the joint. Most notable is decreased joint space, lateral, superior and medially.\n\nB269 Brain MRI \nBRAIN MRI ALSO INCLUDES THE TMJ (PROBABLY RIGHT JOINT)\nFirst sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of sclerosis on top. It appear to be a little bit postured forward in the fossa. The fossa has a little bit of a different kind of shape to it with a little downward depression in the mid part of the fossa area. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Disc appears to be vertically oriented within the joint. It may be acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posterior into the bilaminar tissue. It is in a displaced position, but in a preclick position. Out laterally, this is harder to visualize.\n\nLeft TMJ shows a little bit more arthritic change compared to the opposite side. Disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting beneath the articular eminence as best as I can see. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space in some views toward the medial side. There is anterior beaking present on this condyle. Laterally, the disc is not as readily seen. The joint space appears to be decreased vertically.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows decreased joint space medially. There appears to be some arthritic changes on the head of the condyle. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa. It appears discal tissue may be anteriorly displaced. I really cannot identify discal tissue in the fossa area.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B061", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B061\nB061 is 57 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B061 was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at the age of 9. She is affected in most all of her joints. She is not aware of when the TMJ problems began. She feels that it is more recently. She had orthodontics as a teenager and apparently her bite was pretty good at that time. She then had orthodontics again in her 30s, but only on the lower arch because her teeth were crowded there and the teeth are straightened up. She does not believe that she had an open bite at that time. In her 30s, she also had a rhinoplasty and she had a chin implant. Her primary concerns are as follows:\n\nTeeth do not fit together.\nTeeth are getting crooked.\nBased on B061's MRI, she has severe advanced rheumatoid arthritis of both temporomandibular joints with significant loss of condylar head and neck structure. However, she has no pain associated with the jaw joint issues, nor does she have any problems with headaches. She feels that her jaws function is at a level of 0, her diet is at 0, and disability is at 0.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B061 has fairly good facial symmetry in her middle and upper third face, but some asymmetry in the mandible. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 0. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about a 1 mm off towards the right side, and chin is probably about 5 to 6 mm off to the right side. In profile view, B061 is probably a good 6 to 8 mm AP deficient in the maxilla. The mandible is at least 20 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is extremely short and chin neck angle is poorly defined. Intraorally, she is missing the lower probably second bicuspids, but she does have third molars in place bilaterally. She has some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch and a little bit of gingival stripping. In the upper arch, she is missing probably first bicuspids and has all of her teeth back to the third molars on the right side and on the left side as well. She appears to occlude primarily on the third molars and it is possible the distal part of the second molars may touch, but the rest of the teeth are out of contact. There is about a 2 to 3 mm anterior open bite. She has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship. B061 does have a transverse cant in her occlusion with the left side being about 2 mm lower than the mandible and 1 to 2 mm in the maxilla. Midline of the chin may be just slightly to the right of the midline of the transverse occlusal plane. The chin implant apparently is not centered correctly on the mandible. The chin implant is off towards the right side. B061 states that immediately after the surgery she told the plastic surgeon that it was off center, but he said that was because her face was asymmetric. It is very difficult to see the oropharyngeal areas, but as best this could be seen the tissues look relatively normal and seem to have a relatively normal architecture. Intranasally, the septum is deviated off towards the right side and this seems to block most of the airway. She has a spur at the base of the septum off to the left side. The turbinates on the left side may be more normal in the size, but the one on the right side is difficult to see but may be somewhat enlarged and contributory to the significant obstruction on the right side of the nose. B061 does have pain to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 34 mm, but only about 23 mm without pain. Excursion movements were about 5 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of mandibular second bicuspids and the maxillary first bicuspids. All the rest of her teeth are present. Sinuses appear clear. She essentially has no condyles and I only see remnants of the condylar neck still remaining. She has a root canal in the mandibular left first molar. Waters view shows that the bony septum is deviated significantly off towards the right side. Left airway appears reasonably good, although there may be a spur coming off the superior aspect of the septum into the left side of the nose. Turbinate on the right side appears compressed against the lateral wall from the significantly deviated nasal septum. Sinuses appear clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows that the remnant of the condyle is functioning out of the fossa and beneath the articular eminence. It appears a new fossa has developed anterior to almost where the articular eminence would be. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is likewise postured forward and functioning on the base of the articular eminence and completely forward out of the fossa and probably 7 mm anterior to its normal position. The right side is similarly dislocated to maybe slightly a greater extent. There appears to be a little bit more resorption of the right joint in the condylar head and neck as compared to the left side. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has AP maxillary deficiency and significant AP mandibular deficiency. Oropharyngeal airway is only about 4.2 mm at the soft palate level and about 7 mm at the base of the tongue. She has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology. She has a vertical discrepancy at the occlusal plane levels and also at the inferior border of the mandible where the vertical discrepancy measures about 7 to 8 mm. At the occlusal surface, the difference is probably about 4 mm in the molar area.\n\nBasic diagnoses would be as follows:\nGeneralized rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis of bilateral TMJs with severe destruction. AP mandibular hypoplasia. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Transverse maxillary hypoplasia.\nPosterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. Anterior open bite with occlusion only on the second and third molars bilaterally. Class II end-on occlusion.\n3-mm anterior open bite. Crowding of the lower anterior arch. Decreased oropharyngeal airway.\nDeviated nasal septum.\nHypertrophied turbinates. Nasal airway obstruction. High occlusal plane angle.\nTransverse cant in the occlusion with the right side being 1 to 2 mm higher than the left side.\nPreviously placed and malpositioned Silastic implant to anterior mandible.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPeriodontal evaluation of particularly lower anterior arch and appropriate treatment.\nPresurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure from the anterior teeth. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).\nSurgery.\nBilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward, down graft it posteriorly, and expand it. Bilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). Bilateral coronoidotomies with bone plate stabilization.\nNasal septoplasty. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Removal of Silastic chin implant.\n5. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n6. Restorative dentistry as necessary to complete the occlusion.\n\nB061 MRI AGE: 52/F\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears anteriorly positioned in the fossa, and it appears as though the fossa has been altered and that the actual articulating area is about 8 to 10 mm anterior to the condyle's normal position, but there is almost a new fossa that appears to be generated. There is little articular eminence anterior. The condyle looks very narrow and very sclerotic. There is some kind of tissue material in the joint that evolved just behind the condyle. There is increased tissue posterior to the condyle. The condyle appears to be significantly degenerated and resorbed. There is some kind of hot spot in the articular eminence or base of the skull area and the eminence position is quite bright. I cannot really identify any evidence of discal tissue, but perhaps a little medial and anterior there may be some. It appears the condyle may have received previous surgery. The condylar head is extremely narrow anteroposteriorly.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that looks severely degenerated and there may be some increased soft tissue thickness between the rim of the condyle and the fossa. The fossa looks strange and there does not appear to be an articular eminence. The condyle must very narrow anteroposteriorly.\n\nRight TMJ T2 shows a condyle that is significantly degenerated and appears to be superior and posteriorly positioned in the fossa. The articular eminence is malformed.\n\nLeft coronal view shows a condyle that is extremely narrow medially and laterally and degenerated. It is a little sclerotic on the top. There is joint space present however.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is extremely narrow almost to a knife edge formation. It is sclerotic up to the condylar neck and the remnant of the head. There is decreased joint space vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly maybe about 2 to 3 mm, where on the other side the fossa is laterally and superiorly flat.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nBilateral TMJ severe resorptive arthritis with essential destruction of the condylar heads and articular eminences.

She was referred by a doctor in Monterrey, Mexico, she saw down there, but B365 cannot remember the doctor's name. B365 has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. She has had TMJ problems since she was about 18 years old that she feels was likely initiated from stress she was under at that time. She has it predominantly on the left side. Since the age of 22, she has had maybe 4 or 5 splints, some of those over-the-counter type. She has a lot of chiropractic treatment, massage therapy, acupuncture, and she has also been seeing a psychologist. She did have some intranasal surgery that may been a septoplasty done last year. This improved her airway some, but she still has some problems with congestion particularly during allergy-type seasons.\n\nShe rates her TMJ pain at about a level of 7, average daily pain at 7, jaw function at 5, diet at 2, and disability at 4. She gets headaches predominantly on the left side and temporal area about a level of 6. She gets occasional left-sided earaches and occasional tinnitus. She does experience vertigo and nausea that she states occurs fairly frequently. Other joints that bother her include her left shoulder. Her knees are noisy and she can get some pain particularly if she wears heels or walks for a long time. She has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. She is aware of clenching and sometimes grinding of her teeth at night time and also during the day.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B365 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 3.5 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline as is the chin. The mandibular dental midline may be just slightly off to the right side 1 to 2 mm. She has some mild lip incompetence of probably about 5 mm. In profile view, she does demonstrate some mandibular retraction of probably about 6 to 8 mm. The maxilla appears to have good projection. Intraorally, B365 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some mild crowding of the lower anterior arch. In the upper arch, B365 has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She actually has a third molar in on the left side. She has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship and maybe just a slight Class II tendency on the right side. She has about a 2 mm anterior deep bite relationship. Oropharyngeal tissues looks relatively normal. Tonsils are mild to moderate in size, but appear non-inflammatory. Intranasally, the septum is deviated a little bit off towards the left side. The turbinates are moderate in size. B365 does have some moderate snoring problems. She has moderate to severe daytime somnolence. She sometimes will wake up at night unable to catch her breath. She does not sleep well at night, and she feels that is due to either snoring, pain, or thinking about things. She usually needs a nap during the day. To palpation, B365 has moderate pain over the left TMJ, left temporalis area, left SCM, left posterior neck, and left shoulder. She has moderate tenderness over the masseter muscles, right TMJ, and retromandibular areas as well as the right SCM. On opening, she has an early click in the left joint at 5 to 10 mm of opening and a closing click of about 5 mm. The right side seems to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal incisal opening is about 49 mm, excursion movement to the right 5 mm, to the left 9 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows that she is missing the mandibular third molars and maxillary right third molar, but the left third molar is still present. Sinuses look clear. The septum appears to be deviated off towards the left side. Turbinates particularly on the right side are moderate in size. It is difficult to evaluate the condyles. Axial views show that she has moderately enlarged turbinates. Sinuses, however, appear clear. Frontal view shows the turbinates are moderately enlarged and sinuses are clear. Right TMJ tomograms show what appears to be relatively normal joint space. In the coronal views on the right side, the joint space looks reasonably good as well\nIn the left TMJ tomograms, there appears to be actually greater joint space vertically as compared to the opposite side. The condyle appears to have reasonably good morphology. Coronal views likewise show reasonably good joint space. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B365 has retrusion of the mandible. She has a significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of about 3 mm at the soft palate level and about 7 mm at the base of the tongue.\n\nB365 's boyfriend has observed that she does stop breathing at night and this concerns him. Apparently, this is a common occurrence.\nBasic diagnoses for B365 would be as follows:\n\nLeft TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocation with early reduction. AP mandibular hypoplasia.\nPosterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.\nSlight anterior maxillary hyperplasia.\nClass II end-on occlusion on the right side, but basic Class I on the left.\nHigh occlusal plane angle of 15 degrees (normal 8 degrees).\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway of 3 mm (normal 11 mm).\nHypertrophied soft palate.\nTMJ pain.\nSleep apnea syndrome. Hypertrophied nasal turbinates causing nasal airway obstruction.\nCrowding of the lower anterior arch. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPresurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally in case any interdental osteotomies are necessary.\nAlign and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm of tooth structure to keep from flaring them any further forward.\nSurgery.\nLeft TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward and down graft it posteriorly.

Reviewed the MRIs showing the arthritis and also the indicators of a displaced articular disc that does reduce bilaterally. Doesn't have many TMJ symptoms but does at times get some pain in his jaw joints. Has no problems with headaches, earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or any of those factors as previously recorded. He and his mother definitely agree that the mandible has grown off to the left side in the last couple of years, and it has been a couple of years since his completed his previous orthodontics. Discussed the pros and cons of doing the joint procedure. If the high condylectomies are not done, he has a good probability of continuing to grow on the right side. If the discs are not repositioned, then there is a risk of worsening arthritis particularly since he already has arthritic changes present in both joints. Discussed activities postsurgery as well as dietary restrictions. Discussed the necessity for doing both jaws in order to get the best functional and aesthetic result as compared to doing just the lower jaw or just the upper jaw. Discussed the locations of incisions. The biggest problem affecting them in the financial aspect and the fact that I am not on their plan. They have already met with Dr. . Dr. has told them that he doesn't do joint work. Suggested that possibly Pedro Franco is probably on their plan and would be a possibility for them if the financial factors will control whom they will see. I answered all the questions that B255 and his mother had at this time. Discussed at length sinuses problems, turbinates, etc. The mother, who is an allergist, is more concerned about the middle turbinates. A CAT scan apparently was done that I have not seen, but she says that there are some abnormalities in the middle turbinates. I told her that those could be reduced at the time of surgery. Apparently Dr. told them that the middle turbinates can't be approached during the procedure. I also strongly suggested that the inferior turbinates be reduced in size, and the mother is concerned as to how much is removed as she says she has experienced people who have developed atrophic rhinitis as a result of that treatment. I think likely those are patients that may have been on long-term steroids or other nasal conditions prior to the reduction turbinectomies. They are to contact me if they have any other questions or concerns.\n\nB255  CT Scan Evaluation\nDate of Acquisition:\t\nDate of Reading: \nOn CT of the sinuses, he has extremely large frontal sinuses particularly on the right side where the sinus extends the entire way out to the lateral orbital rim. On the right side, the sinuses are quite a bit smaller but still extend probably almost half way across the orbit. Appears to have a sinusitis in the left frontal sinus where there is some definite thickening, perhaps a mucous retention cyst in the sinus toward the lateral aspect. Maxillary sinuses are quite large. There is no evidence of any sinusitis there. The ethmoid sinuses are also quite large with more septae on the left side than the right side. The inferior turbinates are hyperplastic particularly on the right side. The right turbinate almost totally obliterates the right nasal airway. Left turbinate is quite large, but there is better airway passage on that side. The middle turbinates have a very abnormal shape to them where they actually curve in toward the lateral nasal bones and have essentially a reverse curvature associated with them. The ostium is located quite high beneath the superior aspect of the middle turbinates. The nasal septum is relatively straight. Only the right TMJ is seen in the coronal view, and it shows a significantly decreased joint space vertically. Lateral pole of the condyle is located quite inferior to the medial pole. Impression:\nNormal-appearing bilateral maxillary sinuses and bilateral ethmoid sinuses\nExtremely large maxillary right frontal sinus but clear of pathology\nLeft frontal sinus mucous retention cyst versus thickening of the lining at the lateral aspect of the sinus\nHypertrophied inferior turbinates with the right side being extremely large and almost obliterative of the nasal airway\nBilateral middle turbinates with significantly abnormal pathology with a reverse curvature and hyperplasia\n\nRecommendations:\nBilateral partial inferior turbinectomies\nBilateral partial middle turbinectomies\nB255  MRI Evaluation \nDate of Acquisition:\t\nDate of Reading:\n\nLeft TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is a little bit hard to identify. Head may be overrotated. Condyle appears a little bit narrow. Joint space is difficult to determine. Disc position is difficult to determine. Does appear that there is a decreased joint space vertically.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width, and the condyle appears larger than the opposite side. Appears to be significantly decreased joint space. Articular disc may be medially displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact on the condyle and in the fossa.\n\nAxial views show that both condyles are fairly broad mediolaterally. Cannot identify the disc on these views.\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that out laterally appears to have a fairly good shape but toward the middle and medial aspect there is anterior beaking present. Decreased vertical joint space is present. Difficult to tell where the articular disc is but appears that it may be anteriorly and medially displaced. Appears to be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.\n\nOn opening, there is restricted translation. Appears that the disc may be in position. Condyle looks narrow anteroposteriorly compared to the opposite side.\n\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit broader anteroposteriorly compared to the opposite side. Out laterally there appears to be a little bit of flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. Appears to be decreased joint space superiorly. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced sitting beneath the articular eminence. Articular eminence is relatively shallow in its slope. On opening, there is a question as to whether the articular disc reduces or not.\nImpression:\nLeft TMJ arthritis and possibly anteromedial displacement of the articular disc Right TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation and possibly nonreducing\n\nB255 \nB255 is 17 years old.\nPatient History\nAs far as noting any problems, this has only been within the last one to two years. B255 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, or headaches. He gets periodic TMJ discomfort, more so on the left side. B255 has undergone significant previous orthodontics with Dr. __. He had ortho for about five or six years and had palatal expanders and a number of different appliances. B255 originally did have a lot of difficulties eating and chewing because of a crossbite problem. Dr. ____ retired, and they transferred to Dr. ____. At the completion of orthodontic treatment approximately two years ago, the bite was satisfactory. Since then, there has been a significant shift of the lower jaw off toward the left side and development of an anterior crossbite. He has no headache problems. He gets periodic TMJ discomfort, the last time being a couple of weeks ago that registered at about a level of 4 predominantly on the left side. On an average day, he really doesn't have any significant pain or headache problem. He rates his jaw function at 2 and diet and disability at 0. He does have a significant history of sinus problems and difficulties breathing through his nose. He does experience significant problems with his ears when he flies probably due to change in air pressure. He has difficulties clearing his ears after plane flights. Recent tympanogram revealed that there was fluid in just the left ear.\n\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B255 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is 2 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted off to the left side approximately 3 mm. Mandibular dental midline and chin are fairly well aligned with each other. Therefore, chin is also shifted off to the left side about 3 mm.\n\nIn profile view, B255 has probably about 4 or 5 mm of AP deficiency in the maxilla. In the upper orbital area, may be just slightly retruded by about 2 to 3 mm. Chin also may be just slightly AP deficient by about 3 to 4 mm. Chin-neckline appears fairly normal in length and chin-neck angle is fairly well-defined.\n\nIntraorally, B255 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. He has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower anterior arch. Has fairly good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. A little bit of inflammation about his lower anteriors. In the upper arch, B255 has all of his teeth back through the second molars present. B255 has a Class III cuspid relationship on the right side by about 4 mm and on the left side by probably about 2 mm. Maxilla appears fairly symmetric in anteroposterior position. Slight cant in the transverse plane with the left side being about a millimeter lower than the right side. Oropharynx appears clear. May have a bifid uvula present, but otherwise everything looks relatively normal. Appears to have good oropharyngeal airway space. B255 has a 0 over bite relationship. Is tending toward a crossbite on the left side, and he has an anterior crossbite tendency particularly on the left side. Right side central and lateral incisor are end-on with the lower lateral incisor and cuspid.\n\nIntranasally, the nasal septum is deviated a little bit of toward the right side but not really significantly. Right turbinate is quite enlarged creating a decreased airway on that side. Left inferior turbinate is moderate in size, but there appears to be a little bit greater airway on the left side as compared to the right side. Both turbinates could be hyperplastic and causing some airway problems. Cannot see posteriorly to evaluate the airway dimension at that level.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows that all four third molars are absent. Sinuses appear reasonably clear. Appears there could be some obstruction in the left nasal airway more toward the posterior aspect. Right side shows a turbinate that is enlarged, but it appears there is a little bit of airway at the base of the nose. Has a 3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch. Right condyle appears larger than the left one both in anteroposterior width and in vertical height.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that actually appears narrow anteroposteriorly compared to the size of the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. Decreased superior joint space indicative of possible anterior and/or medial displacement of the articular disc. Occlusion is Class III.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows that there is a decreased superior and posterior joint space. Condyle appears somewhat narrow anteroposteriorly compared to the size of the fossa. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Less of a Class III occlusal tendency on this side.\n\nOn opening, there appears to be a greater restriction of translation on the left side as compared to the right side, although both of they are a little bit shy of translating onto the apex of the articular eminence.\n\nWaters view demonstrates that the septum may be a little bit of toward the right side. Right turbinate is extremely large and essentially obliterates the right nasal airway. Left side does demonstrate some passable airway. There is either enlargement of the middle turbinate or a polyp present in the right side. It most likely may be the middle turbinate. Sinuses look relatively clear and equally lucent on either side.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that he has a skeletal Class III relationship. Has and end-on incisor relationship. Vertical height of the mandible is fairly symmetric with just about a 2-mm difference at the inferior borders. Oropharyngeal airway looks relatively normal. Soft tissues thickness at pogonion is decreased. Tongue looks relatively normal size. Maximal incisal opening for B255 is 41 mm and about 36 mm without discomfort. Excursive movement to the right is 6 mm and to the left 7 mm.\n\nBasic Diagnoses\nRight TMJ condylar hyperplasia and medial displacement of the articular disc Left TMJ arthritis and medial displacement of the articular disc AP maxillary hypoplasia\nMandibular deviate prognathism\nClass III occlusion on the right side and moderate Class III occlusion on the left side\nAnterior crossbite and developing left posterior crossbite\nTMJ pain\nHypertrophied nasal turbinates\nNasal airway obstruction\nChronic sinus problems secondary to nasal airway obstruction\n\nRecommended Treatment\nPresurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Keep the lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally. May need to tip the right lateral incisor root more mesial than it currently is to provide adequate room for interdental osteotomies\nAlign and level mandibular arch\n\nSurgery\nRight TMJ high condylectomy and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor\nLeft TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance, expand, and level the occlusal plane\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to align the mandible back on the facial midline\nBilateral partial turbinectomies\n\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion\nB255 \nTelephone conversation. Last week he had a couple of days when he had increased clicking in his jaw joints where it would click about every hour. This was slightly uncomfortable, but not too bad. This week he is feeling better. He is going to get a night guard made. He has an Essex retainer which is an equal thickness over the occlusal surfaces and it is not good for his occlusion. I told him that could intrude the posterior teeth creating a posterior open bite for him. He understands. He does have an appointment to met the splint man and I told him to be sure that all of the teeth touch in the splint. He has not been taking Klonopin. I explained to him what the problems are that are going on. I explained to him that since his mother did not allow us to use a Mitek anchor that the system we had to use is not strong and supportive of the disc. With his clenching and bruxism that could tear any system apart. Hopefully, he will get better with the splint. Otherwise, he is doing well and enjoying dental school. He is to keep me informed of his progress", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"36mm\", \"patient_age\": 17, \"maximum_opening\": \"41mm\", \"diet_score\": 0, \"disability_rating\": 0, \"jaw_function_score\": 2, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"left posterior crossbite\", \"earache_present\": false, \"airway_obstruction_present\": \"false | true\", \"pain_frequency\": \"periodic, last time being a couple of weeks ago\", \"jaw_clicking\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"current_appliance\": \"3 x 3 retainer in the lower arch | essex retainer\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 0, \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"tmj_pain_rating\": 4, \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior and medial displacement | left disc anterior and medial displacement | right disc anterior displacement possibly non reducing | left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacement | left disc with reduction | right disc with reduction\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics for 5 or 6 years with palatal expander\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | left tmj | right tmj\"}}", "prediction": ""}
{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B226", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B226\nB226 is 13 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX. B226 is in good health with no major medical problems. B226 does have some asthma problems that sometimes are exercise-induced. He takes Ventolin when needed. He is on no other medications. He does have problems breathing through his nose and one side is pretty much blocked off.\n\nPRIMARY CONCERNS\n1. Facial imbalance.\n2. Nasal airway obstruction.\n3. Predominately mouth breather.\nB226 has had orthodontics for about 2 to 3 years but the braces were not placed on all of the teeth, just some of the teeth. B226 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, hearing loss, headaches, TMJ pain or myofascial pain. In frontal view B226 has good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth to lip relationship about 8 mm. Maxillary midline, mandibular dental midline in line with each other. In profile, he has some prominence in the nasal dorsum. The nasal labial angle has pretty good form to it. He has lip incompetence of probably about 10 mm. Cheeks are somewhat sallow by maybe 3 to 4 mm. The lower third face is elongated. Lower lip is everted. The chin appears to be AP deficient by probably about 15 to 18 mm. As he postures his mandible forward, he does have better chin projection. There is a little deficiency in maxillary projection as well. There may be about 3 to 4 mm AP deficient. He does have hyperfunction of mentalis muscle. He has all of his teeth back through the second molars with good attached gingiva. In the upper arch he has all of his teeth back through the second molars present. He has a Class II occlusion with an overjet of about 4 mm. He has a vertical overbite of about 2 mm. The uvula is moderately enlarged. The soft palate may be mildly elongated. The faucial pillars appear fairly significantly constricted. Tonsils are present. The septum is deviated a little bit off to the right side. Turbinates are hyperplastic particularly the left one which is quite large. The nasal airway appears quite constricted. The nasal luminal valves appear fairly constricted. Holding the luminal valves open did not seem to improve his ability to breathe through his nose. He has no tenderness to palpation around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 50 mm. Excursive movements are 8 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the presence of all 4 developing third molars. The rest of the teeth are all erupted in place. Turbinates appear fairly large. Difficult to evaluate the sinuses. The condyles look relatively normal.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses appear relatively clear although the right maxillary sinus appears quite small in size compared to the left one. Turbinates appear to pretty much obliterate the nasal airway. The right side looks larger than the left side at least posteriorly.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be normal in architecture. There may be some anterior beaking. There could be a little bit of decreased superior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly reasonable morphology with perhaps a little flattening on top in one area. The joint space looks pretty good. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening, there is good translation of both joints.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B226 has anterior vertical maxillary excess and AP mandibular deficiency. Occlusion is Class II and he is skeletal Class II. Oropharyngeal airway for the most part looks good except he has an adenoid tissue mass in the nasopharynx that almost touches the turbinates. The turbinate extends posterior to the hard palate. There may be 2 mm of airway space between the posterior aspect of the turbinate and the adenoid tissue. He has significant lip incompetence. He has a vertical bite of at least a couple of millimeters. He does have a left posterior crossbite. With a Class I occlusal relationship, the crossbite worsens. There is tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.\n\nBASIS DIAGNOSES\n1. Anterior vertical maxillary excess.\n2. Transverse maxillary deficiency.\n3. AP mandibular deficiency.\n4. Class II occlusion.\n5. Posterior crossbite on the left side.\n6. Hypertrophied turbinates.\n7. Nasoseptal deviation.\n8. Nasopharyngeal adenoid tissue.\n9. Nasal airway obstruction.\n10. Impacted third molars x4.\n11. High occlusal plane angle.\n12. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\n1. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisal roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. b. Align and level mandibular arch. Strip the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract to correct the tooth size discrepancy.\n2. Surgery. a. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly and level the occlusal plane angle. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction. c. Partial nasal turbinectomies. d. Nasoseptoplasty. e. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.\n3. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB226 MRI EVALUATION\nAGE:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows good mediolateral width of the condyle. There is some decreased lateral joint space. Disc space appears to be medially displaced. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just 1 to 2 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. The disc appears to be medially displaced with a slightly decreased joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly just 1 to 2 mm.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the posterior head and a little bit of anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep particularly towards the lateral aspect of the joint. Disc is not as easily identified at the lateral aspect of the joint as it is over medially. Medially, the disc appears to be in fairly good position. No inflammatory process seen around the joint. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in position.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has a little bit better morphology than the opposite side. There is some slight anterior beaking present. However, the disc appears to be in position. Lateral the disc is a little bit more difficult to see. No inflammatory process is seen in the joint. The articular eminence is fairly steep particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint, a little less inclined more medial.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B278", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B278\nB278 is 19 years old and referred by Dr. ___.\nPatient History\nShe has had previous biopsy of a lymph node behind her ear. She does have mold allergy. B278 is in good health with no major medical problems. She takes Yasmin and Glucophage for polycystic ovaries. B278 has had orthodontics twice before and now has her orthodontic appliances on for the third time and just got these on this year. B278 has had orthodontics x 3. The first time was from 8 to 10 years ago. The second time was 6 to 7 ago. She then went about five years without too much of a change and then her bite started to change again, and her bite started to open more. That is when she went to her dad and said she was ready to proceed on, and then she got braces few months ago. She has seen Dr. __  for surgery.\n\nPatient Concerns\nJaws and teeth don't fit together properly\nDifficult to get her teeth together\nPredominantly a mouth breather\nPossible difficulties breathing through the nose particularly at night when she sleeps\nSome pain and discomfort through the jaws\n\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B278 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is almost 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3.5 to 4 mm. Nasal tip is just slightly off to the right side probably 1 to 2 mm. Maxillary dental midline appears to be pretty much on the facial midline as is the mandibular dental midline and chin.\n\nIn profile, B278 has a slight obtuse nasolabial angle. Upper lip supralabrale is probably about 3 to 4 mm anterior to subnasale. She has lip incompetence of about 9 mm. Lower lip is somewhat everted compared to the AP position. The chin-neckline is short, although the chin-neck angle is well-defined. Chin appears to be AP deficiency by probably 10 to 12 mm. Labiomental fold is fairly prominent in part due to the eversion of the lower lip.\n\nIntraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Teeth are well aligned and levels. She has really good attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. There is an accentuated curve of occlusion in the upper arch. She has a Class II end-on cuspid-molar relationship of probably about 3 to 4 mm. She has an anterior open bite of at least 3 mm. Left cuspid is probably a millimeter lower than the right cuspid. She has had her wisdom teeth removed. When occluding, she hits only on her second molars on the right side. She cannot feel the second molars or any of the other teeth touch from the right first molar all the way around to the left second molar. Oropharynx appears clear, and she has a little red spot on her soft palate just to the right of the midline. It measures about 2 mm across. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. The septum may be deviated a little bit off toward the left side. Seems to have moderate airway constricture. Nostrils are a little bit narrow. Holding her nostrils open, she could breathe easier through her nose. Luminal valves could be a little bit constricted as well. She gets tired during the day but could be related just to college life.\n\nMaximal incisal opening is 55 mm. Excursive movements to the right are 9 mm and to the left 100. Joints seem to function fairly smoothly although there were some rough areas in the joints. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the masseter muscles, TMJs, and high moderate pain over the styloid areas. She had a T&A done when she was in the fourth grade.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows that the sinuses look reasonably clear. Difficult to evaluate the nasal airway as it appears that there is some deviation in the septum, and the left airway looks fairly well blocked. Missing all four third molars. Appears to be adequate space between the lateral incisors and the cuspids, although there is a laceration of the maxillary left lateral incisor where it curves back toward the cuspid. It appears that there is enough room to get through there. Condyles appear a little bit abnormal but difficult to tell on those views.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses appear clear. Nasal airway appears to be fairly well blocked. A little outward curvature of the angle of the mandible on the right side compared to the left side. This may be due to the fact that she has better tooth contact on the right side than the left side.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to be postured forward in the fossa somewhat, and she is in more of a Class I molar relationship than her centric relation would indicate. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Posterior joint space is increased, but I am sure in centric relationship it is going to be decreased. The space between the condyle and the articular eminence appears decreased and less than normal. This could be indicative of possible medial displacement of the articular disc.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has just a touch of anterior beaking present perhaps. Joint space is a little bit decreased posteriorly and superiorly.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of the condyles bilaterally.\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal Class II jaw relationship with a significant anterior open bite. Appears to have vertical maxillary excess but AP mandibular deficiency. There is a vertical difference between the inferior border of the mandible with one side being about 5 mm vertically higher than the opposite side. Oropharyngeal airway looks very good.\n\nB278 has a tooth-size discrepancy. The spacing created in the upper arch between the lateral incisors and cuspids seems to compensate for the tooth-size discrepancy. However, the lower incisors are overangulated, and it would be of advantage to slenderize the lower anterior teeth and retract them some.\n\nBasic Diagnoses\nVertical maxillary excess\nAP mandibular deficiency\nAP microgenia\nClass II end-on occlusion\nAnterior open bite\nHigh occlusal plane angle\nAccentuated curve of occlusion, upper arch\nOverangulation of lower incisors\nTooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2.5 mm\nRule out bilateral TMJ articular disc dislocations\nHypertrophied turbinates\nNasal airway obstruction\nMyofascial pain\nTMJ pain\n\nRecommended Treatment\nPresurgical orthodontics Continue to align and level maxillary arch. If possible, tip maxillary lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally particularly on the left side to help create more space\nContinue to align and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 2 to 3 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth-size discrepancy and to decrease angulation of the lower incisors\n\nSurgery\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to move it superiorly, correct the accentuated curve of Spee, and level the anteroposterior occlusal plane\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction\nBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors Augmentation genioplasty\nBilateral partial inferior turbinectomies\n\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion\nB278 \tMRI Scan Evaluation \nDate of Acquisition:\t\nDate of Reading: \n\nLeft TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width and possibly some slight loss of vertical dimension but difficult to tell. Downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of only 1 to 2 mm. Mandibular condyle lateral pole extends beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. Difficult to tell where the discal tissue is, but it may be anteriorly positioned. Vertical joint space appears reasonably good.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Lateral pole of the condyle extends slightly beyond the lateral rim of the fossa but not quite as far as the opposite side. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of probably 2 mm. Joint space appears to be relatively normal. However, it is difficult to identify the articular disc.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is flattened on the posterior head particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint but has a better morphology toward the medial side. Slight anterior beaking present more toward the medial side. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced particularly out toward the lateral aspect of the joint, but toward the medial aspect it appears to be in better position. Joint space looks good throughout, although at the lateral aspect there appears to be decreased posterior joint space. The disc is sitting in a vertical position along the posterior border of the articular eminence. A little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space but not too significant.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the articular disc with reduction on opening.\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening on the posterior head but not quite as much as the opposite side. More medially it has a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. A little sclerosis on the anterior head. A little bit of anterior beaking more pronounced toward the medial aspect of the joint. Articular eminence is fairly steep similar to the opposite side. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced but the lateral aspect of the joint assumes a vertical position directly behind the articular eminence. Toward the medial side, the disc may be in better AP position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint space but not much.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the articular disc.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B054", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B054\nB054 is 27 years old. B054's TMJ problems began at the age of 26, about one year and seven months ago when she yawned and her jaw locked open. She had a doctor sedate her and put the joint back into position. Her jaws were wired together for about 3 days afterwards and she had some significant pain associated with that. After 3 days, she came back and was unwrapped and then her jaw was locked closed and shifted towards the left side. She was placed on medications and it apparently it took about a month to realize that there was a closed lock situation. Dr. XXXX then did an arthrocentesis five times with no appreciable relief. She then had physical therapy and she was able to open her jaw but had very strong pain. Surgery was done on one year and two months ago with a disc plication of the temporal mandibular joint. Since that procedure, she continues to have significant pain problems. She continues to have limited opening and because of the pain situation she is unable to chew. Primary concerns that B054 has include the following:\n\nSevere left TMJ pain.\nDifficulties opening her mouth.\nUnable to chew and is predominantly on a liquid diet.\nShe has been in splint therapy for two years and has had two splints. She also has had physical therapy. She takes Percocet 5 mg two to three per day and Uptagin, another pain medication.\n\nB054 has no trouble with headaches. She rates her TMJ pain at 9, average daily pain would be at 9, jaw function at 8, diet at 10, disability at 5. She gets pressure in her left ear and has some decreased hearing on that side, but has no tinnitus nor vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her knees and her hips. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing.\n\nIn profile view, B054 has good facial symmetry and balance. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars and all of her upper teeth as well. She is basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has about a 4 mm anterior deep bite relationship. To palpation, she has a pain level of 8 over the left TMJ, but no other pain around the head and neck area. The incisal opening maximally is 26 mm, opening without significant pain 15 mm. The excursion movements are about 3 mm in each direction. Limitation of translation to the left is related to the pain that is created in the left joint without movement. She does not feel that it is due to restriction of the right joint. Oropharyngeal tissues are a little bit difficult to see, but appear relatively normal. Tonsils are maybe mildly enlarged.\n\nBasic diagnoses would be as follows:\nLeft TMJ arthritis and articular disc degeneration.\nLeft TMJ severe pain with severely limited jaw function.\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints.\n2. Surgery. a.\tLeft TMJ condylectomy, diskectomy, and reconstruction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.\tLeft TMJ fat graft (harvest from the abdomen). c.\tApplication of maxillary and mandibular arch bars with removal at the end of surgery.\n\nDr. XXXX had proposed cutting off the condyle and just leaving her a swing where she would develop facial asymmetry. I gave B054 the option of repeating the disc repositioning procedure to set the disc a little bit more posteriorly and more laterally over the condylar head and also perform a sagittal split osteotomy. However, I do not believe that this will work very good for her and gave her a less than 50 percent chance of success with that procedure. I believe she would have a 90 percent chance of success with the total joint prostheses. I also did warn her that it is possible that after the total joint prosthesis is done on the left side that she could develop a problem on the right side, although out studies have shown if there is a healthy right TMJ she would have about a 75 percent chance of the right side holding up and doing well. She has no pain or symptoms on the right side at all. I did discuss the pros and cons of both procedures with her and her grandmother. I answered all the questions that they had. My personal opinion is that the total joint prostheses would be much predictable for her and would get her the best result. I answered all the questions she and her grandmother had. They understand. I did discuss potential risks and complications such as infection, bleeding, nerve damage, etc. They understand. She believes she is anxious to proceed on with treatment. B054 MRI\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. There appears to be some erosions or deformity on the lateral pole area of the condyle. There appears to be discal tissue medially displaced. There appear to be some degenerative changes perhaps in the fossa as well.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears about the same size as the opposite site. The condyle appears to have a little bit better morphology to it and not as degenerative. There is decreased superior joint space and the disc appears it may be medially displaced.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is somewhat degenerated. The articular disc appears to be in reasonably good position, although there are some degenerative factors associated with it. The condyle appears to have some erosions on the head and some little osteophytic kind of formation. It appears there may be some fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is restricted translation of the condyle and the disc. It appears that the disc reduced on opening.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit larger than the opposite side. The disc appears to be more degenerated on this side. The disc appears to be anteriorly displaced. The articular eminence is steep and the disc appears to be in vertical orientation. There are some areas of erosion and/or small osteophytic formations more towards the lateral aspect of the joint. There is a little bit of anterior beaking present medially. On opening, there is limited translation of the condyle and the disc.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ arthritis with a disc medially displaced, but AP in normal position with degeneration.\nRight TMJ arthritis and the disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction.\nBilateral restricted translation.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"15mm\", \"patient_age\": 27, \"maximum_opening\": \"26mm\", \"diet_score\": 10, \"disability_rating\": 5, \"jaw_function_score\": 8, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": true, \"neck_pain_present\": false, \"physical_therapy_status\": \"physical therapy\", \"onset_triggers\": \"yawn locking jaw open\", \"jaw_locking\": true, \"current_appliance\": \"splint\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 9, \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"pain_onset_date\": \"age of 26\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 9, \"current_medications\": \"percocet | uptagin\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"splint for 2 years\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"knees | hips | left tmj\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 27, \"maximum_opening\": \"26mm\", \"diet_score\": 10, \"disability_rating\": 5, \"jaw_function_score\": 8, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"earache_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching\", \"earache_present\": true, \"onset_triggers\": \"yawn\", \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"jaw_locking\": \"left tmj\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"none\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 9, \"headache_location\": \"none\", \"physical_therapy_status\": \"physical therapy\", \"physical_therapy_type\": \"physical therapy\", \"appliance_history\": \"splint therapy for two years\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | knees | hips\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 9, \"current_medications\": \"percocet 5mg | uptagin\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_diagnosed\": \"left tmj arthritis | right tmj arthritis\", \"joint_pain_areas_treated\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_treated_date\": \"one year and two months ago\", \"joint_pain_areas_treated_with\": \"disc repositioning | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc medially displaced | right disc anteriorly and medially displaced with early reduction | left disc med"}

She began orthodontic treatment in the 4th grade, approximately age 10 and she wore headgear for 3 years at night. She had some appliances on by the original orthodontist and then were removed. She subsequently went to see Dr. XXXX and 9 months ago, Dr. XXXX placed orthodontic appliances.\n\nPRIMARY CONCERNS:\n1. Retruded jaws.\n2. Difficulties eating and chewing.\n3. Teeth do not fit together very well.\n4. Snoring.\n5. Difficulties breathing through the nose.\n\nShe takes no medications. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing. She does get headaches at about a level of 7 that occur in the frontal and the top of the head area but only occur about 2 times per month. She rates her TMJ pain at 0, average daily pain at 0, jaw function at 1, diet at 4, disability at 3. She is aware of snoring at night but has no problems with daytime somnolence or sleep apnea.\n\nIn frontal view, B211 has fairly good facial balance in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length when held forward is about 20 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is at least 6 mm. Mandibular dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Maxillary midline may be about 1 mm to the left. Chin may be just slightly to the right. A little bit of orbital dystopia with the right eye being 1 to 2 mm higher than the left side. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is probably about at least 3 maybe 4 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla appears to be retruded probably a good 6 to 8 mm. Chin is retruded by about 20 mm. Chin-neckline is extremely short though the chin-neck angle is moderately well defined but very obtuse. Intraorally, B211 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has appliances on now. Some minor crowding in the lower arch but also a little bit of spacing. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has an unusual shape of the upper arch with some flattening around the front and some mild crowding in that area as well. She has segmental archwires on currently. She has about a 3 mm anterior open bite. She occludes on the right side on the first and second molars and second bicuspids and the same on the left side. She has a Class II end-on occlusion by about 5 mm. She has a crossbite tendency on the right posterior side. Oropharyngeal airway looks reasonably healthy. The uvula and soft palate appear normal. Faucial pillars appear moderately constricted. Tonsils seem relatively normal in size. She has a wide columella and somewhat narrow nostrils. Septum appears reasonably straight. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged particularly for the narrow transverse dimension of the nose itself. To palpation, B211 has no pain around the head and neck area. Joints function smoothly. Incisal opening is about 52 mm. Maximal incisal opening is 52 mm. Excursive movement to the right 7 mm, left 8 mm.\n\nB211\nPage 2\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n: Panorex shows the presence of 4 impacted third molars. The rest of the teeth are present. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Septum appears relatively straight. Difficult to evaluate the condyles but the left one looks a little different than the right side. Cuspid roots are tipped mesially.\n\nWaters view shows that the bony septum at least is fairly straight. The turbinates appear moderately enlarged with significant blockage of the airway. Sinuses appear relatively clear.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. There may be a little sclerosis on the top of it. Joint space appears fairly balanced.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Joint space appears reasonably balanced. Articular eminence is moderately steep in both joints. On opening there is good translation of both joints. The left condyle appears as though there may be some anterior beaking present.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B211 has a retruded maxilla and severely retruded mandible. She has anterior open bite. She has a high occlusal plane angle facial morphology. Oropharyngeal airway is only about 2.5 mm at the base of the tongue and no more than 3 mm at the soft palate level. She has some prominence of the nasal dorsum. Bolton analysis shows that there is some relatively small tooth size discrepancy although on the model assessment it appears that the upper laterals are small. On the other hand it appears that the lower teeth may have been slenderized.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES:\n1. Severe AP mandibular deficiency.\n2. AP maxillary deficiency.\n3. Anterior vertical maxillary excess.\n4. High occlusal plane angle.\n5. Class II end-on occlusion.\n6. Anterior open bite of 3 mm.\n7. Severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of 2 mm (normal dimension 11 mm.)\n8. Snoring.\n9. Crowding of maxillary arch.\n10. Mild crowding of lower anterior arch.\n11. Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x4.\n12. Wide columella and narrow nostrils.\n\nB211\nPage 3\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\n1. MRI of left and right TMJs.\n2. Presurgical orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. Use a continuous archwire in the upper arch. Tip the lateral incisor mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies if necessary. Disconnect second molars from the archwire. b. Align and level mandibular arch. Disconnect second molars from the archwire.\n3. Surgery. a. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superiorly, level the curve of Spee and correct the transverse cant in the occlusion. b. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise rotation with pogonion coming forward approximately 20 mm. c. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. d. Nasal columella reconstruction. e. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.\n4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB211\nMRI EVALUATION\nAge: 16/F\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. Difficult to identify discal tissue between the condyle and fossa. The disc may be anteriorly displaced. Joint space seems adequate although slightly decreased out laterally.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. There appears to be adequate joint space but difficult to identify discal tissue. There may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. Transverse width of the fossa on the right side seems more narrow as compared to the left side.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears a little bit arthritic. There is some flattening on the posterior head and a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence is relatively normal in inclination. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting down towards the articular eminence. There does not appear to be any significant fluid within the joint space. No open static views are included unfortunately in this study.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some arthritic changes with a little bit of flattening on the posterior had and a little bit towards the anterior aspect. The articular disc is more prominent towards the lateral aspect of the joint than the medial aspect. The disc is anteriorly displaced sitting down wards the articular eminence. I would suspect that the disc would reduce on opening but no open static views are available.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B075", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B075\nB075 is 15 years and 10 ½ months of age. B075 was born with a cleft palate that was repaired at the age of 7 months. He then had a pharyngeal flap performed at the age of 4. He has had several sets of tubes in his ears. He takes no medications except occasional allergy medicines. He has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain, tinnitus, or vertigo. He gets occasional earaches. No other joints are of concern at this time. He rates jaw function at 9, diet at 1, and disability at 0.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B075 has good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 2 mm. The maxillary midline is probably about 3 mm off to the left side. The mandibular dental midline is about 1 mm off to the left side. The chin is about 1 mm off to the left side. In profile view, upper lip is probably about 5 mm AP deficient and the chin is about 20 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is extremely short, although the chin neck angle is reasonably well defined. He has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. Intraorally, B075 is missing the lower first bicuspids that were extracted for orthodontic reasons. The lower teeth are almost a little bit over retracted. In the upper arch, he is missing the first bicuspids and may be missing the second bicuspids all on the left side. He has an anterior open bite of about 1 to 2 mm. He has a Class II cuspid relationship on the right side and to a lesser extent a non-Class II relationship on the left side. Upper teeth are pulled back in significantly lingual inclination. He has adequate attached gingiva, although the gingiva are somewhat inflamed. The lower arch is fairly symmetric relative to the AP position of the cuspids. In the upper arch, the left cuspid is probably about 3 mm posterior to the right cuspid. He has a nice repair on the palate. There is a pharyngeal flap present with an oronasal opening in the mid part of the flap. The palate appears nicely repaired. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal as does the septum. He has some mild nasal airway obstruction. He has moderate to severe snoring, moderate daytime somnolence, but does not have any sleep apnea symptoms apparently. He has a moderate sleep disorder. B075 tends to breathe more through his mouth than his nose except when he is out in public when it gets much easier. B075 has no tenderness around the head and neck area to palpation. Joints function smoothly. Incisal opening is 43 mm and excursion movements are about 7 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the presence of four impacted third molars. He is missing the first bicuspids in all 4 quadrants plus the second bicuspid in the left maxillary quadrant. Right sinus appears to have something in it. It is difficult to evaluate the TMJs. Waters view shows that there is a septal spur going off the right side of the septum. Turbinates are moderate in size. Sinuses look relatively clear. Right TMJ tomogram shows that a condyle that has fairly good morphology and there appears to reasonable joint space, though difficult to evaluate radiograph. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ tomogram is likewise a little bit hard to read, but it appears that everything is relatively normal there. On opening, there is good translation of both condyles. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B075 has a retruded maxilla, significantly retruded mandible, and a high occlusal plane angle. He has a low positioned pharyngeal flap also present. Upper and lower incisors are decreased in angulation. He has a head postured forward neck position.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B075 would be as follows:\nRepaid palatal cleft.\nPosterior pharyngeal flap. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Posterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia.\nAP mandibular hypoplasia. Class II occlusion on the right side, Class II end-on occlusion on the left side. Missing appears second bicuspids in the lower arch, maxillary right second bicuspid, and mandibular left first and second bicuspids. Maxillary dental midline shifted 3 mm to the left of the facial midline. Anterior open bite.\nImpacted third molars x4.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPresurgical orthodontics. Continue to align and level maxillary arch. Open up space between the left cuspid and first molar to equal about 6 mm (about the same width as the bicuspid on the opposite side) as this will improve the overall dental fit as well as flare the upper incisors forward and align them better on to the facial midline.\nContinue to align and level mandibular arch. Monitor facial growth and development.\nSurgery.\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward about 6 mm, level it transversely, and expand if necessary. Lengthen the pharyngeal flap, if necessary, to accommodate the maxillary advancement. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward approximately 18 mm. Surgical removal of impacted third molars x4.\n4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n5. Restorative dentistry. a. Place osteointegrated implant to the maxillary left bicuspid area. b. Place crown on maxillary left implant.\n\nB075 MRI AGE: 17/M\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a small condyle with significant loss of condylar structure. There is decreased superior joint space. There may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat with a downward curvature of probably about 2 mm. There may be a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is small in size with loss of vertical and mediolateral volume. This condyle appears a little bit larger than the opposite side. There appears to be decreased joint space vertically. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably a couple of millimeters. Difficult to identify discal tissue, but there may be some anterior to the condyle.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B525", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B525\nB525 is 15 years old, referred by Dr. XXXX.\n\nPatient History\nLast month, B525 had her tonsils removed. Apparently she had lots of problems with tonsillitis, and her tonsils were huge even then noninflamed. B525 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her neck and her knees occasionally. She has usual environmental kind of allergies. If she wears cheap earrings, it can cause some ear problems for her. She is not aware of clenching or bruxing her teeth at night. She had a tonsillectomy done last month. She was in a motor vehicle accident about 6 years ago, and about 2 years ago she fell down the stairs at school. About two or three years ago, she began for an unknown reason to develop locking in her jaw joints and clicking and popping. She really has not had any specific treatment to date yet. Dr. XXXX has been following her since she was about 8 or 9 years old but has not initiated treatment yet because he is still waiting for the permanent teeth to erupt in. About two or three years ago, B525's jaw began to start to lock up on her. She is not aware of any particular reason why the joints started to lock up on her. To date she has had no specific treatment for her situation.\n\nPatient Concerns\nTeeth don't fit together very well\nLocking in the jaw joints\nClicking and popping in the jaw joints\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B525 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 19 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 mm. Maxillary midline may be about a millimeter off to the left of the facial midline.\n\nIn profile view, she has a little bit of deficiency in the upper lip projection of probably about 3 to 4 mm. Lower lip is in fairly good balance with the upper lip, although the chin is somewhat prominent. Chin is anterior to the lower lip by probably 4 to 5 mm.\n\nIntraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Left second bicuspid is just starting to erupt into the oral cavity . Lower incisors appear to be in lingual version. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth through the second molars. Upper lateral incisors look somewhat small. She has an end-on Class III cuspid relationship. She has an anterior overbite of about a millimeter. She has an open-bite greater on the left side from the lateral incisor back to the first molar. On the right side, there is a lesser degree of open bite, but still significant. B525 has bilateral posterior crossbites and end-on incisor relation. Teeth include the left maxillary first and second molar, mandibular second molar, four central incisors, right second bicuspid through second molar in the upper arch, and in the lower arch first and second molar.\n\nTo palpation, she has moderate pain over the TMJs and milder pain over the masseter and styloid areas. Joints seem to function reasonably smoothly at this particular time though she does say that her jaws occasionally get locked. Incisal opening is 48 mm. Excursive movements are 7 mm in each direction. On opening, the joints seem to function relatively smoothly at this particular time.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nThe middle part of the Panorex is blocked off, so I cannot see the teeth from the left central incisor through the right first bicuspid in the upper arch and in the lower arch from lower cuspid to right second bicuspid. There are impacted mandibular third molars x 2 but do not see any maxillary third molars. The condyles appear to have fairly good morphology. Sinuses appear reasonably clear.\n\nWaters view shows that there appears to be some deviation of the nasal septum back in the bony aspect. Turbinates are moderately enlarged. Sinuses appear clear.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is sort of moderate in steepness. Disc appears to be a little bit posteriorly positioned in the fossa with a slightly increased anterior space.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Joint space may be slightly decreased posteriorly. Articular eminence is a little bit more shallow on this side than the opposite side.\n\nOpen views show good translation of the condyles where the condyles come out beyond the articular eminences.\nBasic Diagnoses\nRule out bilateral TMJ condylar hyperplasia and articular disc dislocations\nAP maxillary deficiency\nTransverse maxillary deficiency\nSlight vertical maxillary excess\nMandibular prognathism\nClass III occlusion Significant lingual inclination of lower incisors\nAP soft tissue macrogenia\nImpacted mandibular third molars x 2\nTooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of about 1.5 to 2 mm\nHypertrophied turbinates\nNasal airway obstruction\nTMJ pain\nMyofascial pain\nHeadaches\n\nRecommended Treatment\nPresurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch. Consider opening up spacing around the upper lateral incisors of about a millimeter around each tooth to account for the tooth-size discrepancy. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Be careful not to expand the upper arch too much because she already has an accentuated curve of Wilson, and she will need surgical expansion anyway to get a good fit\nAlign and level mandibular arch. Try to tip lower incisor teeth forward as far as possible. This will likely create an anterior crossbite. If it does create an anterior crossbite, this will actually be to advantage\n\nContinue to monitor growth for condylar hyperplasia and for TMJ disc dislocations\nConsider possible repeat of MRI\nSurgery\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to reposition the mandible in a clockwise direction\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it forward, expand it, and move the posterior aspect superiorly slightly\nPartial turbinectomies\nRemoval of mandibular impacted third molars\nConsider bilateral TMJ high condylectomies and articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors if condylar hyperplasia is identified and/or disc displacements are confirmed\n\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion\nB525 MRI Scan Evaluation\nDate of Acquisition:\t\nDate of Reading:\n\nNo coronal views are available.\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that appears a little bit flattened on top particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially the condyle appears to have better confirmation. Out laterally the disc is not seen as well which could be indicative of a medial displacement. Otherwise disc appears to be in fairly good position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. At least some views show what appears to be an attempt to open with significant restriction, although the disc appears to be reduced in position. Translation is fairly minimal in the joint, if, in fact, these are open views. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.\n\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has a little bit of flattening superiorly particularly toward the lateral aspect. More medially it has a little bit better confirmation. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. In one T-2 view, it appears that the disc could be sitting beneath the articular eminence, and on a couple other views it tends to indicate that it may be anteriorly displaced on this side. There is some fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces.\n\nImpression:\nLeft TMJ mild arthritis. Articular disc appears to be in good position although there could be a slight medial displacement\nRight TMJ articular disc possible displacement\n\nB525 MRI Evaluation\nDate of Acquisition:\nDate of Interpretation:\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with head and neck that appears extremely long. Disc appears anteriorly displaced more so at the lateral aspect of the joint. There is decreased posterior joint space. The condylar head appears narrow anteroposteriorly in the mid aspect of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nRight TMJ shows similar elongated head and neck of the condyle. Posterior aspect of the condyle appears a little bit flattened and the condyle appears narrow in the mid part the joint as well as over medially. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be in a vertical orientation and anteriorly displaced. There is a decreased posterior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. It also extends posteriorly in the posterior sulcus.\n\nLeft coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral head of the condyle comes out even with the lateral rim of the fossa. There appears to be decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint at the lateral rim. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. Difficult to identify discal tissue but in one view it appears that it may be medially displaced. Decreased joint spaces mainly at the lateral aspect of the joint. In the T2 films, the condyle appears much larger but very difficult to identify discal tissue. Open view of left TMJ shows that there is good translation of the condyle. The condylar head appears extremely narrow and again the head and neck appear quite elongated. The condyle comes anterior to the articular eminence. It appears that the disc may be in position.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has relatively normal mediolateral width. There is a significantly decreased joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint. Cortex appears to be intact in the fossa and condyle but the bone is extremely thin in the fossa. Cannot see evidence of the disc in this view. Right TMJ T2 images show what appears to be a little bit better size to the condyle as compared what was seen in the T1. Difficult to separate out the discs in these views. In some of these views, condyles appear somewhat large mediolaterally as well as vertically. Right TMJ open view shows likewise good translation of the condyle where it comes anterior to the articular eminence. It appears that the disc is in place and reduces on opening. In the coronal views on opening, also there appears to be good translation forward and it appears that the discal tissues are in place in the open views.\n\nIMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ elongation of the head and neck of the condyles compatible with condylar hyperplasia.\nBilateral TMJ anterior dislocation of the articular disc with reduction on opening.\n\nDental model analysis shows that the patient still has bilateral posterior crossbites. Dr. XXXX has opened up significant spacing between the upper laterals and cuspids being about 4 mm on the right side and 3 mm on the left side. He was able to jump the occlusion but she is still end-on Class III by almost 5 mm on the right side and 4 mm on the left side. Still very stable occlusion plus the fact that she has significant pain problems and joint pathology.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B511", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B511 \nB511 is 20 years old. I saw B511 originally when she was about 5 and the last time I saw her she was about 8 years old. By history, when B511 was 5 years old, her family was in Saudi Arabia. She was on a wall that was about 7 feet tall and she fell off of it and hit her jaw sustaining a right subcondylar fracture. I saw probably some time after that as she likely was not having any real significant symptoms and the malpositioned condyle had already solidified. While she was in orthodontics and for a time afterwards, she would have an occasional flare-up, but nothing real significant or constant. Dr. XXXX performed orthodontics on B511 5 years ago for 2 years and he practices in Houston. She had four bicuspids extracted for orthodontics. For the past 2 years, B511's pain problems associated with her jaws have increased.\n\nAt this time, she complains of headaches that occur on the right side almost daily that occur at a level of 8 in the frontal and temporal areas predominantly. She rates her right-sided TMJ pain at 8, average daily facial pain that occurs only on the right side at 7, jaw function at 0, diet at 7, and disability at 4. She gets right-sided earaches frequently. She has right-sided tinnitus and gets frequent vertigo. She has no other joints that bother her. She is allergic to Ceclor. She is not aware of clenching or bruxism.\n\nPrimary concerns B511 has at this time include the following:\nRight-sided headaches. Right-sided TMJ pain. Difficulties eating and chewing. She cannot wear any hair type products that puts pressure in and around her right ear area as it creates significant pain problems. Facial asymmetry.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B511 has fairly good facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face, but she has asymmetry in the lower third face. Upper lip length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship appears to be about 3 mm. The maxillary midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. The mandibular dental midline is about almost 2 mm off to the right side and the chin is almost 5 mm off to the right side In profile view, she has some AP maxillary deficiency and a little bit of AP mandibular deficiency. AP maxillary deficiency appears to be probably about 4 mm. The chin may be retruded by 6 to 8 mm. Chin neckline appears a little bit shortened, and she does have a slight head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, she is missing the lower first bicuspids. She has a 3 x 3 retainer. She has adequate attached gingiva in the lower anterior arch.. In the upper arch, she is missing the first bicuspids. She has a slight Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right side by about 2 to 3 mm, but on the left side she is fairly close to being Class I. She has an anterior deep bite of about 2 mm. There is a transverse cant in the maxillary occlusion with the right side being about 1.5 mm higher than the left side. The right mandibular cuspid may be about 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid. Chin is probably about 3 mm to the right of mandibular dental midline. By aligning her mandibular dental midline, her chin does still remain off towards the right side. To palpation, B511 has some very high moderate pain over the right masseter and moderate pain over the right temporalis and moderate tenderness over the right TMJ, right styloid area, and right posterior neck. Joints seem to actually function relatively smoothly. On opening, she has a maximum of 50 mm of incisal opening, but about 34 mm without significant pain. Excursion movement to the right is 8 mm, to the left 7 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues looks healthy and normal. Intranasally, the septum may be deviated just a little off to the right side. It appears she has some moderately decreased airway on the right side, but the left side looks open at least in the anterior aspect of the nose.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars and all four first bicuspids. Sinuses appear relatively clear. The left condyle looks normal. The right condyle shows evidence of a previous fracture with the height of the functioning condyle at the top of the neck area with the complete condyle itself missing. The ramus on the right side appears short in vertical dimension. The vertical height of the mandible on the right side in the body area is also slightly decreased compared to the left side. Waters view shows that the bony septum is reasonably straight. Turbinates appear moderate in size. There does appear to be a passable airway. Sinuses look clear. Left TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Joint space looks adequate. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is extremely short in vertical height. Articular eminence is quite shallow. The condyle is actually functioning far anterior on the articular eminence and essentially out of the fossa. On opening, there is fairly good translation of both joints. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has some mild AP maxillary and mandibular deficiency. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 6.5 mm at the base of the tongue and maybe 7 mm at the soft palate level. Incisors appear to be in reasonable angulation, although both maxilla and mandible appear AP retruded.\n\nBasic diagnoses would be as follows:\nRight TMJ subcondylar fracture.\nRight TMJ abnormal morphology secondary to previous condylar fracture with bony osteophytes that extend beyond the articular disc. AP maxillary hypoplasia. Right maxillary vertical hypoplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia.\nLoss of vertical height of the right side of the ramus secondary to previous subcondylar fracture. Class I cuspid relationship on the left side, Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right side. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being 2 mm shorter vertically than the left side.\nMaxillary midline on the facial midline, but mandibular dental midline shifted 2 mm to the right and the chin is shifted 5 to 6 mm to the right. Right TMJ pain. Right-sided headaches.\nClosing premature contact on the right molars.\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPresurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery.\nRight TMJ arthroplasty, articular disc repositioning and debridement of joint to allow the condyle to be positioned centrically in the fossa.\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible about 5 mm and level it transversely.\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla and level it transversely.\nAnterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to shift the chin approximately 4 mm to the left of the facial midline.\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB511  MRI\nAGE: 20/F\nDOB:\nDate of Acquisition:\nDate of Interpretation:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good shape and morphology. Joint space looks fairly good. Disc may be slightly medially displaced.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is significantly abnormal in shape. There appears to be loss of vertical height. The condyle is cup shaped on the superior surface. It appears, however, there may be discal tissue present. There appears to be decreased lateral joint space. There is a little deviation in the shape of the fossa as well as a little dimpling upwards at the mid fossa area.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. Articular eminence has moderate inclination. Out laterally the disc is hard to see and appears to be anteriorly displaced at the most lateral aspect of the joint. However, more towards the center of the joint the disc assumes a better position between the fossa and condyle. On opening, there is some moderately good translation of the condyle and the articular disc is in a reduced position between the condyle and articular eminence.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is very dysmorphic. There is some sclerosis on the head of the condyle and there is a V notch in the midportion of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle is postured somewhat forward in the fossa. The disc actually appears to be in reasonably good position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle and the articular disc with the disc in a reduced position. On opening views, there is a right V notch within the condylar head with some peaking of the condyle posteriorly, but later the condyle appears to be reduced beneath the articular disc.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ articular disc anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint, but with very early reduction. Left condyle with a normal architecture, but an anteriorly positioned disc at the lateral aspect of the joint but with early reduction.

She was riding in a bus that got hit by an 18-wheeler from behind and slammed her into the side of the bus on her left side and she hit the whole left side of her face and left side of her body. She rates her headaches at a level of 6 in the frontal, temporal and posterior head area and has particular problems with pain behind her eyes. She rates her TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 5, diet at 3, disability at 2. She gets frequent left-sided earaches, frequent tinnitus, moderate to frequent vertigo, and she has hearing loss when she gets the tinnitus. Other joints that bother her include her left hip, her knees, back (3 herniated disks) and neck. She had none of these problems prior to her accident. She also has some neurological factors affecting her legs and arms. She is aware of severe clenching and bruxing at nighttime and also during the day. She did not have this prior to her injury. The only medication she takes is Tylenol at times. She has essentially had no specific treatment to date.\n\nB_001 has good facial symmetry and balance. She has relatively normal upper lip length of about 21 mm and upper tooth lip relationship of 2 mm. She has good balance in her profile. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some crowding in the lower anterior arch and she has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the third molars. She does have an impacted mandibular left third molar. She has a broken down mandibular first molar with a broken tooth and restoration. Oropharyngeal tissues look relatively normal except the tonsils are of moderate size. She has basically a Class I occlusion. She has 1 mm anterior over bite relationship. Nasal structures look relatively normal. She apparently occasionally snores and has some moderate daytime tiredness, but is not aware of having overt sleep apnea. She is aware of breathing through her mouth at nighttime. To palpation, she has moderate to high moderate pain throughout the head and neck area. The worse pain to palpation is in the left TMJ. The maximum incisal opening is 49 mm and opening without pain 30 mm. The excursion movement to the right is 5 mm and to the left 6 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the presence of all teeth. The mandibular left third molar is in distal angulation and impacted.\nCoronal view shows that she has an enlarged mandibular left turbinate. She has a little sinusitis with some increased thickness of the synovial lining in the floor of the nose.\n\nIn the axial view, she has some increased thickening of the sinus membrane along the posterior and lateral aspect of the sinus. The left turbinate appears significantly enlarged compared to the right side.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa, but there is a good anterosuperior and anterior joint space.\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that is posteriorly positioned in the fossa, but there is a good anterosuperior and anterior joint space.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 or 3 mm. There appears to be adequate joint space, although slightly increased on the medial side.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. The top of the condyle is more flattened as is the fossa.\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a skeletal and occlusal Class I relationship. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 9 mm at the soft palate level and about 7 to 8 mm at the base of the tongue.\n\nB_001 does state that her speech is affected sometimes by the muscle spasms that she develops. When she is talking to the parents of her school kids, her jaw sometimes will pull off to the side.

Her problems began about nine years ago at the age of 53. Her dentist told her that she needed some spacing closed or she would have difficulties in the future. This started a major downhill slide leaving B056 severely compromised. She went from having a relatively normal occlusion to where she has just some retained roots of the maxillary first and second molars bilaterally with two remaining implants in the upper jaw and missing mandibular left central incisor and left first molar. All four third molars are absent. At one point, there were ten implants placed in the upper jaw and eight of them have now been removed with only two remaining. B056 has very methodically outlined her treatment to date.\n\nB056 rates her headaches at about a level of 8 in the frontal and temporal area bilaterally. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 8, diet at 5, disability at 9. She gets earaches on the left side occasionally, but has continuous tinnitus. She gets occasional vertigo and has hearing loss in the left ear. She has left leg stress fractures and also this involves the left side of her foot. She has right shoulder problems as well as hip problems. She has chronic left side fatigue. She is aware of clenching her teeth during the day, but not aware as to whether she does it at night.\n\nTo palpation, she has high moderate pain over the TMJs and moderate pain over the masseters, posterior neck, and mild discomfort over the shoulders. On opening she has a click on both sides with the right side being somewhat softer than the left side. On the left side, the opening click is at about 20 mm and a closing click at 15 mm. On the right side, the opening click is probably a little bit earlier at 15 with a closing click at about 10. She takes the following medications:\n\nASA 81 mg q.d.\nMultiple vitamin supplements.\nHe diagnoses list would include the following:\nBilateral TMJ mild arthritis and articular disc dislocations.\nAbsence of all maxillary teeth except for the first and second molars bilaterally.\nMissing mandibular left central incisor and left first molar.\nLingual inclination of lower incisors.\nMaxillary alveolar ridge atrophy.\nTwo osteointegrated implants in the maxilla with questionable stability.\nTMJ pain.\nHeadaches.\nMyofascial pain.\nClenching.\n\nI had Dr. XXXX come and evaluate B056 with me, and her treatment plan at this point in time would be as follows:\nTreatment of clenching with Klonopin 1-mg tablets 1 tablet q.h.s. Consultation with Dr. XXXX.\nOrthodontics on the lower arch to align and level the lower arch, opening up space for the missing left central incisor as well as space around the deformed left cuspid. This will tip the lower incisors forward into a better position over basal bone. Surgery Stage 1: Bone grafting to maxilla including sinus lift procedures as well as augmenting anteriorly and vertically on the alveolar ridge. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.\nOsteointegrated dental implant placement to include four or more implants. The current maxillary implants will likely require removal.\nSurgery Stage 2: Placement of interosseus implants. Restorative dentistry to reconstruct the arches.\n\nB056 MRI AGE: 60/F\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears a little arthritic. Disc appears to be medially displaced. The condyle appears to have good mediolateral width. Joint space looks fairly good throughout however. Right TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The disc appears to be anteriorly and laterally displaced.\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has flattening on the posterior head. The disc appears to be in reasonably good position. At the most lateral aspect of the joint, the disc may be anteriorly displaced. On opening, there appears to be good translation of the condyle and the disc bilaterally.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some flattening on the posterior head. It appears that the disc is in position, but it does appear a little bit degenerated.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B400", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B400 \nB400 is 34 years old. B400 has had some previous surgery including right knee arthroscopy 20 years ago. She had bilateral TMJ surgery 9 years ago and had sinus surgery 8 years ago. She had a laparoscopy 8 years ago and a hysterectomy 7 years ago. The surgeries were done on both jaw joints 9 years ago. Apparently there was a bone spur on the right side that was removed and then the discs were repositioned. Dr.   did the initial surgery.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS\nUltram.\nLexapro 20 mg.\nEstratest q.d.\nFioricet p.r.n.\nShe has had a reaction to penicillin, Ancef (anaphylactic shock), codeine and hydrocodone where she has a rash and vomiting.\n\nB400 states that her temporomandibular joint problems began as young as 5 to 6 years of age when her jaw would pop of unknown etiology. Before the temporomandibular joint surgery she did have orthodontics and splint therapy that was to no avail. 9 years ago she had the bilateral temporomandibular joint articular disc repositioned and she apparently had a bone spur removed from the right temporomandibular joint. She did not really experience any improvement in her symptoms following the surgery. She has had the following treatments in reference to the temporomandibular joints besides the surgery:\nOrthodontics x3.\nSplint therapy x6.\nMaxillary front teeth capped to help improve her occlusion.\nEquilibration.\nPhysical therapy.\n\nShe gets earaches and vertigo sometimes and she gets decreased hearing in the right ear but no problems with tinnitus. Other joints that bother include a right shoulder, right wrist, right hand, right fingers and right hip. She is very aware of clenching and bruxing at night and also she does it at times during the day. She gets some daily headaches about a level of 4 being worse on the right temporal sides compared to the left temporal side. These headaches can escalate to a level of 7 to 8 and actually initiate nausea and vomiting. The headaches are daily and frequently she will wake up with them but the other days she will develop them later on. She rates her average temporomandibular joint pain at 4, average daily pain at 6, jaw function and diet at 7, disability at 5.\n\nPRIMARY CONCERNS\nTemporomandibular joint pain.\nHeadaches. Muscle pain to the jaw areas.\nPain underneath the lower jaw.\nDifficulties eating and chewing.  \n\nSpeech affected.\nSnoring. Daytime tiredness.\nChronic clenching and bruxing.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, middle and upper third face appear to have fairly good symmetry. In the lower third face, the angle of the mandible and body of the mandible on the right side appears to be probably about 4 to 5 mm lower than the left side. Right angle is a little more prominent than the left angle transversely. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper-tooth-to lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. Actually the maxillary midline is 1 mm off to the left. Mandibular dental midline is about 2.5 mm off to the left and chin is about 6 mm off to the left. In profile view, she has fairly good projection of the upper lip with no more than 1 to 2 mm of AP deficiency. The chin is probably 10 to 12 mm AP deficient. Chin-neckline is extremely short and chin-neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, she has had lower first bicuspids removed. Some mild crowding in the lower anterior arch. Minimally adequately attached gingiva around the lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch she is missing first bicuspids. A little bit of crowding of upper anterior teeth. Little bit of a division II occlusion relationship. She has just a slight Class II about 1 to 2 mm at the most. She has about a mm vertical overbite. Intraorally, the oropharyngeal tissues look healthy. The uvula is a little bit elongated but the soft palpate and the faucial pillars appear relatively normal. B400 has a transverse cant in the occlusal plane in the upper arch with the right cuspid being 3 mm lower than the left. In the lower arch, the left side is probably just 2 mm higher than the right. Intranasally, turbinates are very mildly enlarged but not too significant. There appears to be adequate airway. The mucosal looks reasonably healthy. The septum appears relatively straight. To palpation, she has moderate discomfort over the temporomandibular joints, styloid areas and milder tenderness over the temporalis masseters, SCMs and posterior neck. Maximal incisal opening is 27 mm and about 20 mm without significant discomfort. Excursive movement is about 2 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars and all 4 first bicuspids. Sinuses look relatively clear. Condyles look short in vertical height and appear arthritic.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses appear clear. The bony septum appears straight. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged.\nLeft temporomandibular joint tomograms show some significant arthritis in the condyles and some sclerosis. There appears to be significantly decreased joint space between the condyle and fossa. Articular eminence is relatively shallow. Decreased superior and anterosuperior joint space.\n\n \nRight temporomandibular joint tomogram shows a condyle that has developed some arthritic changes. Articular eminence is deeper on this side. Joint space looks a little bit better balanced at least in one of the cuts. In another it appears that the joint spaces are more diminished. There is a pseudocyst in the back of the head of the condyle. Condylar head and neck on the right side is a little bit longer than on the left side. On opening, there is restricted translation in both joints.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she is AP deficient in both the maxilla and mandible. Occlusal plane is elevated. There is a discrepancy in the inferior border of the mandible at the angle with the right side being about 6 to 7 mm higher than the left side. Oropharyngeal airway is decreased with only about 3 to 4 mm at the most and about 4 mm at the base of the tongue.\n\nOTHER SYSTEMS\nB400 has problems with her right shoulder, right hand, right wrist, right fingers and right hip. She got frequent urinary tract infections from about the age of 4 to 10 that occurred on a frequency of about 1 time per month. Her periods were irregular and she had excessive pain prior to her hysterectomy 7 years ago. She has not had any miscarriages or fertility problems. She does have 2 children ages 12 and 10. The hysterectomy was required because of the endometriosis. She also had history of ovarian cyst. She has had pink eye a few times in the past and she has had a few bouts of conjunctivitis. She gets burning, itching and dryness of her eyes but does not wear contacts. She has allergies related to sinus problems. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and has done this for 16 years. She gets earaches, occasional vertigo and gets occasional infection in the ear and has lots of hearing in the right ear. She gets bronchitis about 3 times a year and this has occurred for about the last 9 years. She had pneumonia once when she was 8 years old. No gastrointestinal problems reported and she is not aware of any exposure to chlamydia. She does have fatigue problems. She was around birds from about the age of 15 to 17 when the brother had 2 doves and also had about 5 to 8 pigeons. She has had cats all of her life and currently has 3. Some of those ate birds, rodents and other stuff. She has had a dog since about the age of 13 and the dog catches squirrels and rabbits. She has been exposed to horses and cows in the past. She is not aware of having any implants in her body.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES\nSevere bilateral temporomandibular joint reactive arthritis.\nMaxillary AP hypoplasia and transverse asymmetry.\nPosterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia. Mandibular AP hypoplasia.\nClass II end-on occlusion. Decreased oropharyngeal airway of about 3 to 4 mm (normal 11 mm.)\nTemporomandibular joint pain.\nHeadaches.\nMyofascial pain.\nEaraches and occasional ear infection on the right side.\nNocturnal daytime clenching and bruxism.\n \n\nSignificant limitation of jaw movement.\nMasticatory dysfunction.\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlign and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch.\nCT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol) of the TMJs and jaws. Surgery.\nBilateral temporomandibular joint reconstruction and mandibular advancement using TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla slightly and down graft it posteriorly. Bilateral coronoidectomy.\nBilateral fat grafts to the TMJs (harvest from the abdomen.)\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB400  MRI Evaluation \nAge: 34, F\nDate of Acquisition: \nDate of Interpretation: \nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that is quite deformed. There is a lot of artifact around the joint probably related to previous surgeries in the area. There are osteophytic extensions from the condyle with an obvious one medial and then one going superior to the lateral extent of the remaining condyle. On one view it looks like there may have been a condylar fracture with the remaining condylar head medial to the condylar neck.\n\nRight TMJ lateral view shows that whatever is left at the condylar head is masked to be cause of interferences probably related to previous surgery. The neck of the condyle appears to be laterally positioned towards the lateral extent of the fossa. I do not evaluate any functional interrelationship between the fossa and condyle.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view, shows a condyle that is better seen in this view. It is quite arthritic with degenerative changes and osteophytic formation. There is bone development in the joint and extending in a posterior direction off of the articular eminence. There appears to be a lot of fibrosis in the joint. There appears to be less bone-on-bone contact. There is a lot of interference indicative of previous surgeries. There may be some inflammation around the joint. It is difficult to tell if there is any translation because of the significant interference in the joint.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows some imaging of the condyle. There are significant degenerative changes in this joint. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There may be some discal tissue in place on the left side in one view but there is a tremendous amount of interference particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint. There may be some inflammation in the bilaminar tissues. On opening, there is some mild translation. There appears to be a fluid at the posterior head of the condyle. There may be some discal tissue within the joint space but it appears to be fairly degenerated. Towards the medial aspect of the joint, it appears that there is almost bone-on-bone contact.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ severe arthritis with no identifiable disc and severe interference seen in the area of previous surgery.\nRight TMJ severe osteoarthritic changes with evidence of some discal tissue but highly degenerative and evidence of previous surgery.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"20mm\", \"patient_age\": 34, \"maximum_opening\": \"27mm\", \"diet_score\": 7, \"disability_rating\": 5, \"jaw_function_score\": 7, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"hearing_loss_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching | bruxism\", \"physical_therapy_status\": \"physical therapy\", \"earache_present\": true, \"adverse_reactions\": \"penicillin | ancef | codeine | hydrocodone\", \"airway_obstruction_present\": \"false | daytime somnolence | snoring\", \"headache_frequency\": \"daily and frequently will wake up with them but the other days will develop them later on\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"muscle_pain_score\": \"moderate\", \"headache_location\": \"right temporal\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 6, \"headache_intensity\": \"4can escalate to a level of 7 to 8 | present\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"5 to 6 years of age\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 4, \"current_medications\": \"ultram | lexapro | estratest | fioricet\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"styloid | temporalis | masseters | scms | posterior neck\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj earache_present: true\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics x3 | splint x6\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj | right shoulder | right wrist | right hand | right fingers | right hip | tmj\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening\": \"27mm\", \"patient_age\": 34, \"maximum_opening\": \"20mm\", \"diet_score\": 7, \"disability_rating\": 5, \"jaw_function_score\": 5, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"hearing_loss_present\": true, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching | bruxism | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | sinus surgery | hysterectomy | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | right tmj surgery | left tmj surgery | orthodontics | splint | maxillary splint | orthodontics | orthodontics | orthodontics | orthodontics | 3mm | 6mm | 7mm | 1mm | 4mm | 2mm | 3mm | 5mm | 2mm | 6mm | 7mm | 0mm | 7mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm | 0mm"}
{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B360", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B360 \nB360 is 64 years old and referred by Dr. _.\nPatient History\nB360 has had a previous appendectomy, hysterectomy, and hemorrhoid surgery. She also at the age of 10 or 11 had polio. She also has fibromyalgia and migraine headaches. She also has degenerative arthritis. She has degenerative disc disease in the lower back. She has had previous problems with anemia. She has thyroid problems, and she has low thyroid hormone.\n\nShe has had adverse reactions to PENICILLIN AND SULFA AS WELL AS #5 YELLOW DYE.\nOther joints that bother her include her neck, lower back, occasionally her shoulders, her wrists, her knuckles are enlarging in her hands, her hips, knees, feet, and toes. Sometimes her feet will draw up. She has earaches, tinnitus, occasional vertigo, and hearing loss particularly on the left side. She has had hearing loss since a long time ago with unknown etiology. She has a history of clenching and bruxing nocturnally. B360 gets headaches in the frontal, temporal, and posterior head area at about a level of 8 on the left side and probably a level of 7 on the right side. Her TMJ pain on an average day is about 5 but can escalate easily to 9. Her pain on an average day is about a level of 7. She rates her jaw function at 7, diet at 9, and disability at 8.\n\nCurrent Medications\nFiorinal #3 with codeine\nDiazepam 2 mg. Sometimes she has to take 5 mg\nUltram 50 mg\nLortab 7.5 mg taken at night to help her sleep\nArmour Thyroid\nPaxil\nGlucosamine/chondroitin Imitrex\nAmitriptyline 25 mg q.h.s.\n\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B360 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 1 mm. Maxillary dental midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline is shifted just about 1 mm to the right. Chin is pretty much on the facial midline.\n\nIn profile view, she has fairly good facial balance. Some AP deficiency in the chin area, but otherwise structures appear to be in reasonable balance.\n\nIntraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. She has crowns on the second bicuspids through the second molars. Has adequate attached gingiva. Some mild crowding, lower anterior arch.\n\nIn the upper arch, she is missing the right second and third molar. She has crowns on the remaining three upper molars. She has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship and about 1-mm overbite relationship.\n\nTo palpation, she has some moderate discomfort over the temporalis muscles, TMJs, left shoulder, and high moderate tenderness over the right SCM and right posterior neck. Her pain does cycle from side to side, and at times it will be worse on one side, and then it will be less on that side and be more intense on the other side.\n\nOn opening, she has significant crepitation in both joints, but it is audible in the left TMJ. Maximal incisal opening is 35 mm, but she only opened about 10 mm without having significant discomfort. Excursive movements to the right are about 8 mm and to the left 7 mm.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex reveals the sinuses appear clear. Right turbinate appears a little bit enlarged, and the left one is fairly small. Missing all four third molars and the maxillary right second molar as well as mandibular left first molar replaced by a bridge. Apparently B360 did have an upper partial to replace the missing maxillary right second molar, but she left it out for a while, and then it did not fit. She has root canals on the maxillary right cuspid, second bicuspid, and first molar.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears small in size and appears it has lost vertical dimension. There is decreased superior and posterior joint space. Some anterior beaking is present. Condyle appears narrow anteroposteriorly.\n\nLeft TMJ tomograms show severe arthritis in the left condyle with loss of condylar substance. Condyle is very narrow anteroposteriorly. Severely decreased posterior joint space. Some beaking of the condylar head. Degenerative changes within the condylar head. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nIn open views, it shows that there is restricted translation bilaterally; however, clinically she seems to have good translation, although there appears to be decreased joint space between the condyles and the articular eminences. Both articular eminences just have moderate inclination to them.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses are all clear. Left maxillary sinus is larger than the right maxillary sinus. Nasal airway looks good. Turbinates appear moderate in size.\n\nCephalometrically, she appears to have a high occlusal plane angle and some retrusion of the maxilla and mandible. She has significantly decreased oropharyngeal airway of only about 2 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue about 5 mm.\n\nOropharynx appears clear; however, the posterior faucial pillars appear to attach into the posterior pharyngeal wall area, and the distance from the soft palate to posterior pharyngeal wall is extremely short. Uvula actually is relatively normal in size.\nPatient Concerns\n\nHeadaches TMJ pain\nNeck pain, shoulder pain, and back pain\nCervical problems\nDifficulty eating and chewing\nEating frequently generates headaches Talking causes pain and headaches Sleep disorder\nSevere snoring\nApneic episodes when sleeping\nDaytime somnolence\nShe is aware of the fact that she sometimes wakes up at night unable to breathe.\n\nBasic Diagnoses\nBilateral TMJ severe arthritis and severe degeneration of the articular discs with perforations\nMandibular hypoplasia\nSlight AP maxillary hypoplasia\nPosterior vertical maxillary hypoplasia\nClass I occlusion\nSeverely decreased oropharyngeal airway of 2 mm (normal is 11 mm)\nHigh occlusal plane angulation\nMissing mandibular left first molar (replaced by a pontic) and maxillary right second molar as well as all four third molars\nEaraches\nTinnitus\nHearing loss\nTMJ pain\nMyofascial pain\nSleep apnea\nSevere snoring\nDaytime somnolence\n\nRecommended Treatment\nPresurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch.

This is very narrow mediolaterally. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. Significant downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. In fact, it hooks back in toward the neck of the condyle. It covers the entire head of the condyle. This could possibly be heterotopic bone, and it could be associated with an ankylosis. On some of the view, there is virtually no joint space, particularly around the lateral wall of the joint.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that is very sclerotic as was the other side. Significant decreased joint space. The condyle is very small with evidence in both joints of significant condylar resorption. Lateral rim of the fossa curves downward around the condyle and again extends well down toward the condylar neck of the condyle. In some areas there appears to be major loss of joint space which could be indicative of ankylosis. Difficult to identify discal tissue on these views, although there are some views that it appears there may be some displaced discal tissue.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has undergone some resorption. There is flattening on the anterior head. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. There is an increased joint space particularly toward the medial side. There is some evidence of discal tissue present, but it is severely deformed and very narrow anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately shallow.\n\nT2 films show significantly worse arthritis being present with an osteophyte extending up from the condylar head in the mid head portion that is fairly significant.\n\nOn opening, there is very minimal translation. The condyle remains in the depth of the fossa.\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle which is small in size. Evidence of significant resorption is present.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B399", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B399 \nB399 is 60 years old and referred by Dr.  . He smokes 1 ½ ppd of cigarettes. B399 has high blood pressure the is treated with medications. His primary concerns are: Pain in the jaw joints.\nClosed lock with inability to open mouth adequately to eat.\nSnoring.\nDaytime tiredness.\n\nB399 became aware of having jaw pain 2-3 months ago when he had endodontic treatment. He feels the device used to open his mouth and suction fluids caused the problem. B399 has had no treatment for his jaw condition to date. Dr.  does not feel B399 can be treated without surgery.\n\nB399 takes the following medications:\nLipitor 40 mg qd.\nMotrin 800mg bid\nLisinopril 20mg qd\nHyzaar 100-25 qd.\nB399 rates his TMJ pain at 6, average daily pain at 7, jaw function at 6, disability at 0. He gets headaches on the left side at a level of 3.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B399 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 23 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is probably about -1 mm. The maxillary midline is pretty close to being on the facial midline and so is the mandibular dental midline. Chin may be just off the right side probably 2 to 3 mm. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 3 to 4 mm. Maxilla is at least 6 mm AP deficient. Chin is probably about 10 mm AP deficient. Chin neckline is short, and chin neck angle is not well defined. He does have a head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, B399 has all of his lower teeth back through the second molars. It is possible that the second molars may be missing and the third molars may have drifted forward into the second molar position, but difficult to tell clinically. He has a lot of erosion on his lower anterior teeth. In the upper arch, he is missing first bicuspids bilaterally and has the rest of his teeth back through the third molars present. He has a Class II end-on cuspid relationship, being slightly greater perhaps on the left side as compared to the right side. He is probably about 3 mm Class II. He has an anterior deep bite of at least 4 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and anatomically appear to be normal. Intranasally, the turbinates appear moderate in size. The septum appears reasonably straight. Luminal valves appear somewhat constricted, but he may have some nasal airway obstruction, but B399 reports that he is not aware of any difficulties breathing through his nose. To palpation, B399 has no tenderness around the head and neck area. Maximal incisal opening is 37 mm and excursion movement to the right 7 mm, to the left 10 mm. Joints function relatively smoothly. Jan's main factor is that he cannot open wide enough to eat properly and normally. The restriction he feels is on the left side.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of the maxillary first bicuspids and the mandibular second molars, but the mandibular third molars have drifted forward into the second molar position. In the upper arch, the third molars are present. The sinuses look relatively clear as best that can be seen. It is difficult to evaluate the condyles. He has a lot of crowns particularly on the maxillary incisors and on the mandibular first molars, right mandibular bicuspid and cuspid as well as the maxillary right bicuspid. Waters view shows that he does have a deviation of the bony nasal septum. Nasal airway does appear somewhat obstructed. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Tomograms are not taken since we did have an I-CAT. Basic diagnoses for B399 would be as follows:\n\nAP maxillary hypoplasia.\nAP mandibular hypoplasia. AP macrogenia. Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. Sleep apnea. Class II end-on occlusion.\nMissing maxillary first bicuspids and mandibular second molars with the third molars drifted forward into the second molar position, but with significant mesial inclination. Anterior deep bite of 4 to 5 mm.\nCrowns on the 4 incisors as well as on some of the posterior teeth. TMJ pain. Headaches.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPresurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Open up 1 mm of space between the upper lateral incisors and cuspids bilaterally. Align and level mandibular arch. Try to level the third molars.\nSleep study. Discontinue smoking. Surgery.\nMaxillary osteotomy to advance it forward approximately 6 to 8 mm. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance it forward about 8 mm. Left TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchor. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\nRestorative dentistry as necessary to maximize the occlusal fit.\n\nI did discuss with B399 about his significant smoking problem, and it would be extremely important for him to stop smoking beforehand. The smoking will significantly increase the potential risks for complications including infection and interference with the healing process. He understands and he will heed my recommendations to stop smoking several months prior to surgery. I did review all the other major factors in reference to complications and answered all the questions that he had at this time in reference to the diagnoses and recommended surgery. I strongly suggested he get a sleep study as well.\n\nB399  I-CAT  \nAGE: DOB:\nDate of Acquisition: Date of Interpretation: \nI-CAT shows in the sagittal view that the mandible is postured forward perhaps secondary to splint wear. There is arthritis on the head of the condyle with some anterior beaking and some narrowing that is anteroposterior particularly in the mid-part of the condyle. Articular eminence is moderately steep. The condyle is positioned down and forward on the articular eminence. In the right side, the condyle is positioned down almost beneath the articular eminence. The condyle has a little bit better shape on the right side, although it does have a little bit of hockey stick shape to it. Articular eminence may be a little bit steeper on this side compared to the opposite side. In the axial view, both condyles are fairly broad mediolaterally.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has some sclerosis in the head of the condyle. The condyle is postured forward in the fossa so it is difficult to evaluate any joint space.\n\nRight condyle appears to be a little flat on top, but again is postured forward so unable to evaluate the joint space.\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ arthritis. Right TMJ mild bony changes.\n\nB399 MRI  \nAGE: DOB:\nDate of Acquisition: \nDate of Interpretation:  \nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology. Articular disc appears to be in position. Articular eminence is relatively normal in angulation.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that towards the medial aspect is quite narrow and pointed superiorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting almost beneath the articular eminence. There is fluid in the anterior joint space. Disc on the left side actually appears to have fairly good morphology yet, but is definitely anteriorly displaced. There is peaking on the head of the condyle.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. There is a little bit of a lateral osteophyte extending almost beyond the lateral rim of the fossa. There appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle. Left TMJ open view shows significant restriction of translation and the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has fairly good mediolateral width. There is narrowing of the joint space at the lateral aspect of the joint with the disc slightly medially displaced. On opening, there appears to be restricted translation, but the disc is in a normal position.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced without reduction.

She has had three sets of tubes in her ears and adenoids and tonsils removed. She has some sinus problems. She takes Prozac 20 mg daily and she takes birth control medication. She takes Naproxen 500 mg p.r.n. She gets earaches, tinnitus and occasional vertigo. The only other joint that really bothers her is her left shoulder. She has some clenching at nighttime and during the day. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, facial pain and headaches at 4, headaches at 4 in the temple and top of the head area.\n\nIn frontal view, B268 has good left to right facial symmetry in the middle and upper third face. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 mm. Maxillary midline is shifted about 1.5 mm to the left. Mandibular dental midline is shifted probably 5 mm to the left. Chin is probably about 6 mm to the left. In profile view, B268 has fairly good facial balance. She has fairly good chin projection. There may be just some slight deficiency in the maxillary projection may be 2 to 3 mm. Otherwise, she has good facial balance. Intraorally B268 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. Teeth appear to be fairly well aligned and leveled. Lower incisors are tipped lingually. She has a little bit of spacing around the right and left cuspids. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. Maxillary left cuspid is about 1 mm posterior to the right cuspid. The lower arch appears fairly symmetry. Slight cant in the occlusal plane with the right cuspid being about 1 mm lower than the left cuspid. She has a Class III end-on cuspid relationship on the right side being probably about 3 to 4 mm Class III and on the left side is a little bit closer to being a Class I. She has a crossbite on the left posterior side and anteriorly on the left side. She has 0 vertical overbite. Maximal incisal opening is 56 mm. Excursive movement to the right 9 mm, left 7 mm.

Mild tenderness to palpation over the left masseter, left medial pterygoid, left styloid area and moderate discomfort over the left TMJ.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n:\nPanorex shows the absence of the lower third molars but present impacted maxillary third molars. Sinuses look relatively clear. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Right condylar head and neck appear elongated compared to the left side.\n\nWaters view shows the sinuses are clear. Turbinates are enlarged particularly on the right side. She does have a nasal ring in position on the right side. The mandible is deviated off towards the left side.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology with a little flattening on the posterior head. Joint space looks fairly good. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nRight TMJ shows an elongated length of the condylar head and neck. Joint space appears a little bit decreased. Articular eminence is moderately shallow. On opening there is some restricted translation on both joints.\n\nB268 \nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has some slight AP maxillary deficiency and perhaps some mandibular prognathism. There is a vertical difference in the heights of the inferior border of the mandible as well as the occlusal plane. Oral pharyngeal airway is somewhat constricted with the base of the tongue with dimension of about 5 mm, soft palate measures closer to 8 mm. Moderate high occlusal plane. A little bit elongated vertical length of the mandible.

Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it, move it superiorly and correct the transverse arch discrepancy. Removal of impacted maxillary third molars. Bilateral partial nasal turbinectomies.\n\nB268 MRI EVALUATION\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3 mm. Joint space appears decreased. There appears to be discal tissue displaced medially and probably anteriorly.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears much larger in size and shape. Significantly decreased vertical joint space. The trabecular pattern appears a little bit different. It extends out to the lateral rim of the fossa. Difficult to tell where the discal tissue is.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with a little bit of flattening on the anterior head of the condyle. A little peaking of the condyle. Articular eminence has moderate inclination but somewhat elongated. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and appears to be sitting beneath the articular eminence. There appears to be some decreased superior joint space. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior and inferior joint spaces. On opening, there is significantly reduced translation of the left condyle and it appears to be in a closed lock situation.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have an elongated condylar head and neck. Articular eminence is moderately inclined. The articular disc is posteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space and actually at the base of the articular disc, which is posteriorly displaced. In the right joint, there is very minimal translation and the articular disc remains posteriorly displaced.\n\nIMPRESSION: Right TMJ condylar hyperplasia with posteriorly displaced articular disc.\nLeft TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly displaced with closed lock\n\nB268  MRI EVALUATION\nIt is not labeled where I can read it so we will do side one first.\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that out laterally has a little flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence has a moderate inclination to it. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting along the posterior aspect of the articular eminence but anterior to the condyle. There may be slight decreased vertical joint space. There may be just a small osteophyte sticking off the top of the condyle. There is some fluid in superior joint space underneath the articular eminence. Open views show that there is restricted translation of the condyle. However, it appears that the articular disc does reduce.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have some arthritic changes particularly at the lateral aspect of the condyle where the top is flattened. More medial there is a little bit better shape but still some degenerative changes. Articular eminence has moderate inclination. It appears that there may be discal tissue posteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but particularly at the posterior aspect of the condylar neck near the base of the posterior band of the disc. Open views show virtually no translation of the condyle and the articular disc remains posteriorly displaced.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle to have fairly good morphology mediolaterally. There appears to be slight decreased joint space. There is some discal tissue medial. There also appears to be discal tissue anterior. There is moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of about 3 mm.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears fairly large. There appears to be significantly decreased joint space vertically. Moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim about 2 to 3 mm. It appears there may be discal tissue posterior to the condyle. Right condyle appears significantly larger than the left condyle.\n\nIMPRESSION: Left TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly dislocated with reduction. Right TMJ enlarged condyle with articular disc posteriorly displaced.\n\nB268 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient is about 5 days post surgery. Doing fairly well. Suctioned her nose today. Her occlusion is reasonably good. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. She is in fairly good spirits. Getting her diet down well. She is progressing nicely and return to see me in one day.\n\nB268 \nB268 presents for followup evaluation. The patient is doing fairly well. Occlusion is good. I suctioned her nose and she had a lot of mucus and bloody materials in her nose and sinuses. She has a sore throat and examination shows that she has a buildup of yeast intraorally. I gave her prescription for Nystatin 100,000 units/mL, dispensing 200 mL, 1 teaspoon q.i.d., rinse mouth thoroughly, hold for 5 minutes, then swallow. I answered all the questions she and her mother had today. She is progressing well except for the yeast buildup. She is to return to see me in one day.\n\nB268 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. Occlusion is fairly good, although not quite as well interdigitated on the left side. I took off the elastics on the right and just placed some relatively light vertical elastics on the left side and a light Class II elastic on the left side. Removed her sutures today. I suctioned her nose. Swelling is decreasing. The yeast infection is much improved, and she is feeling much better in regard to that. She is progressing nicely and to return to see me in one day.\n\nB268 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient having some problems with nausea and constipation. She apparently threw up today on her way to the office. She popped off some more brackets. I clipped a wire removing some of the brackets on the left side, and I removed all of her elastics. Occlusion is actually reasonably good and because some of the brackets that have come lose, it may be better if we do not proceed with any elastics at this time, but wait until she gets back to the orthodontist and let him begin to finalize the occlusion. The nausea and the constipation could be related to the narcotics she is taking (hydrocodone) and the antibiotics. I told her to stop taking her antibiotics. She is to continue on with the Nystatin for one more day as her mouth appears to be clean at this time. I gave her a prescription for Ultram 50-mg tablets, dispensing 40 tablets, 1 tablet q.3 hours p.r.n. pain. Will see if this decreases her problems in both nausea and constipation. I also suggested that she try over-the-counter Dulcolax or a similar type medication to see if this would help her. She will try this. She has moderate swelling, but overall appears to be progressing satisfactory. I did suction her nose today and got a fair amount of mucus out of both sides of her nose. She is progressing satisfactorily and to return to see me in one day.\n\nB268 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing very well. Occlusion is fairly good, but slightly open on the left side. I placed a vertical elastic on that side in the bicuspid area. I suctioned out her nose. She is progressing well and to return to see me in one day.\n\nB268 \nThe patient presents for followup evaluation. The patient doing fairly well. I took off the current elastics and put a light Class II elastic on the left side. Did a note to her orthodontist. She can have her splint removed in mid-October. I drew directions on how to remove the splint. She is in good spirits. Did not need her nose suctioned today. Pain is under control. I gave her a prescription for Klonopin 1-mg tablets, dispensing 30 tablets, one tablet q.h.s., refill x5, and gave her a prescription for Ultram 50, dispensing 50 tablets, 1 tablet q.4 to 6 hours p.r.n. pain, refill x1. She is doing well and to return to see me around Thanksgiving, and she is to call me if she has any concerns or problems.\n\nB268 \nTelephone conversation with B268 . B268 has been having a little bit of sinus problems on the left side. She went to see her doctor and the doctor put her on Augmentin as an antibiotic. She says the right side has cleared and she is getting some feeling back on the right side, but the left side of her face is still pretty numb. She has had some crackling in her joints as she has moved her jaws, and I told her this was normal and actually a good thing. She otherwise is progressing well and to keep me informed of her progress.\n\nB268 \nB268 presents for followup evaluation. She is doing reasonably well. Incisal opening is about 34 mm and excursion movements were about 1 or 2 mm in each direction. She is taking the following medications:\n\nKlonopin 1 mg q.h.s.\nAmbien 5 mg q.h.s.\nBirth control pills.\nProzac 40 mg q.d.\nTramadol 50 mg p.r.n. pain.\nSwelling is decreased. Occlusion looks very good. No evidence of infection or wound dehiscence. Palatal splint has been removed. There is one wire yet remaining around the maxillary left and submaxillary right cuspid that were removed today. Otherwise, she appears to be progressing well. I answered all the questions she and her mother had. She does feel like she has a sinus problem, but in her nasal airway I could not see any drainage and at the oropharyngeal airway I could not see any drainage. I will get some x-rays to evaluate that. We also removed the wire from the right maxillary cuspid. She is progressing nicely and to return to see me for a 1 year follow-up.\n\nB268 \nTelephone conversation with her. She says has a little bump up in the vestibule of the upper jaw around the canine area. She felt it might be a bone plate. I told her that the bone plates are quite high, so it would be very unusual for that to happen. She states she got some brown strings out the other day so it very well could be the sutures coming out. She does not have a bad taste in her mouth and does not have any swelling, but does have a little bit of tenderness up in that area. It could be just the incision is a little bit tender for her. She is not running a temperature. She does have an appointment to see me in about a week and a half or so. Unless she develops any other significant problems, we will wait until her appointment and see her then.\n\nB268 \nB268 presents for followup evaluation. She is now about almost 11 months post surgery. Doing fairly well. She rates her TMJ pain at about a level of 2, average daily pain at 5 but this is mainly in the shoulders and in the neck area. She rates her jaw function at 2, diet at 0, disability at 0. She gets headaches about 2 days a week in the frontal and temporal areas, but feels this may be related to nocturnal clenching. Incisal opening is 45 mm and excursion movements are about 3 mm in each direction. Occlusion looks good and stable. To palpation, she had some moderate tenderness over the left masseter muscle. Joints seem to function smoothly. She currently takes birth control pills and Prozac 40 mg q.d. She gets some earaches on the left side greater than the right side, but no tinnitus but occasional vertigo, and she does have some decreased hearing. Other joints that bother her include her left shoulder, hips, and knees. She is aware of nocturnal clenching.\n\nI suggested that she go back on Klonopin, but she does not like that medication. Therefore, we will try Flexeril first, so I gave her a prescription for Flexeril 10 mg, dispensing 30 tablets, 1 tablet q.h.s., refill x5. Otherwise, she appears to be progressing nicely. X-rays look good. She has some decreased sensation to the lower left lip and chin area, but hopefully this will continue to improve for her.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B225", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B225\nB225 is 14-1/2 years old. She is in good health with no major medical problems.\nBy history, three years ago she got kicked in the jaw by a horse. She had some upper teeth fractured and laceration on her chin area that did not require any closure. She was not knocked out but apparently got kicked away from the horse. It fractured some front teeth in the upper arch. It did not seem to create any problems for her relative to eating and chewing as long as she bit on her back teeth and she obviously could not chew very well with her front teeth for awhile. She has really had no other treatment.\n\nIn frontal view, B225 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. There may be just some slight increased fullness on the right side as compared to the left wide. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 3.5 mm. Mandibular dental midline and chin midline are pretty much on the facial midline. Maxillary dental midline maybe about 1 mm off to the left side. In profile view, she has reasonably good facial balance. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch she has all of her teeth back through the seconds molars. She has a reverse curve of Spee in the upper arch. Central incisors appear to be somewhat extruded. She has basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. She has an anterior deep bite of about 3 mm. Oropharynx appears healthy and uvula, soft palate and faucial pillars are all within normal limits. Intranasally, turbinates look moderately enlarged but the transverse width of the nose is very good and it appears that she has adequate airway space. According to B225's mother, B225 does have some bruxism that occurs predominately at nighttime. She has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. No other joints bother her. She takes no medications. It was about 3 years that she got kicked by a horse and it hit her in the chin but there were no significant problems with other areas since the injury. She is unaware of any soreness or pain that she may have had in the jaw joints at the time. She said she has had no treatment since that time. To palpation she has had very mild tenderness over the masseter muscles and left medial pterygoid muscle but no other pain to the head and neck area. On opening, she has a click in the left joint at 10 mm of opening and 10 mm of closing. Relative to the right joint there is an opening click of 15 and closing click of 10. Maximal incisal opening is about 28 mm. Excursive movement to the right 6 mm, left 5 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n: Panorex shows that she has impacted third molars in all 4 quadrants. Sinuses are clear. Nasal airway looks reasonably clear. Hard to evaluate the condyles on this view.\n\nWaters view shows that she has huge frontal sinuses. The sinuses appear relatively clear. Right turbinate appears a little bit enlarged compared to the left side.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that appears to have anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is prominent. There appears to be decreased vertical joint space. The condyle appears somewhat arthritic. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology. There appears to be a decreased joint space. Articular eminence is mildly steep. On opening, there is some restricted translation in both joints.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that she has a good skeletal and possible an occlusal relationship with a slightly anterior deep bite. Oropharyngeal airway is somewhat constricted with the airway margin of about 5 to 6 mm at the soft palate level and towards the base of the tongue hyoid area. There appears to be slightly anterior vertical maxillary excess. There appears to be a high occlusal plane angle.\n\nBefore moving here from Panama, B225 lived out in the country and they had a lot of chickens. B225 would play with the chickens for a good part of the day everyday until she was 7 years old and moved here. The mother remembers one episode when she was about 4 years old she developed a fever and apparently had significantly elevated white blood cells. She was told that she should go to the hospital but the mother nursed her at home and she got better. She was given some antibiotics and apparently this helped her. It is possible she could have been exposed to Chlamydia psittaci.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES:\n1. Bilateral TMJ reactive arthritis with medial articular disc displacements.\n2. Limited incisal opening of only 28 mm.\n3. Crowding of lower anterior arch.\n4. Mild crowding of upper anterior arch.\n5. History of extensive exposure to birds (rule out Chlamydia psittaci infections in the TMJs.)\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\n1. Conference with Dr. Gladstad and MRI radiology.\n2. Consider the following blood tests. a. ANA. b. C-reactive protein. c. Rheumatoid factor. d. CBC. e. Chlamydia antibody titers. f. Sedimentation rate.\n3. Orthodontics. a. Align and level maxillary arch. b. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth as necessary to correct for the tooth size discrepancy (approximately 2 to 3 mm.)\n4. TMJ surgery if indicated following blood tests and further assessments.\n\nB225 MRI Evaluation\nAge: 14/F DOB:\nDate of Acquisition: Dat of Interpretation:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant arthritic changes. There is a significant depression in the mid part of the condyle with a medial osteophytic extension. Decreased lateral joint space. It appears that there is discal tissue medially displaced sitting about the mid condylar position. There is decreased lateral joint space. Moderately downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of probably about 4 mm. There is almost a 4 mm vertical step from the lateral aspect of the condyle down towards the medial aspect.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has similar morphology to the opposite side except the step in the medial half of the condyle is not quite as deep as on the left side. Decreased lateral joint space. It appears that the disc is medially displaced and sitting into the depression in the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably 3 mm. There may be some discal tissue anteriorly positioned. The condyle lights up significant to a much greater extent as compared to the left condyle which also lights up excessively.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows out laterally there appears to be decreased joint space. As the mid part of the condyle is approached, the anterior band of the articular disc can be seen. As we get further into the joint space, the posterior band can be seen sitting a little bit forward on the condyle. At the step area, there is a significant arthritic appearance with some superior peaking of the condyle and very large appearing erosion on the anterior aspect of the condyle. More medially, there appears to be a thickened, somewhat deformed disc that may be in position. No particular inflammatory process seen but the condyle certainly has major arthritic changes associated with. Articular eminence is moderately steep. In the open views, the cuts appear to be done more on the medial side of the mandible and on the lateral aspect it is excluded. On opening, there is fair translation of the condyle and the articular disc appears to be in a reduced position.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows out laterally the condyle actually looks fairly reasonable in shape. There is some discal tissue towards the lateral aspect of the joint but not all the way out to the lateral aspect. Articular eminence is moderately steep. As the medial aspect of the joint is approached there is an erosion in the condylar head and the disc appears to be in a little bit better position towards the medial aspect of the joint. There is a hot spot in the head of the condyle actually through most of the condyle probably compatible with cystic formation within the condyle. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space but not too much. In T2 films, the head of the condyle really lights up in some areas. At least at the levels of the cut the disc appears to be in position.\n\nIMPRESSION: Bilateral TMJ loss of medial condylar bone with medial displacement of the articular discs that could be anterior bony cysts in the right condyle.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 14, \"maximum_opening\": \"28mm\", \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": false, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"bruxism\", \"earache_present\": false, \"airway_obstruction_present\": false, \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"jaw_clicking\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"current_medications\": \"none\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacement | left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacementmuscle_pain_score: very mild\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"masseter | left medial pterygoid\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | left tmj | right tmj\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 14, \"maximum_opening\": \"28mm\", \"diet_score\": \"good\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacement\", \"muscle_pain_score\": \"mild\", \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"jaw_clicking\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"current_appliance\": \"none\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_score\": \"none\", \"headache_frequency\": \"none\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 0, \"headache_intensity_present\": false, \"pain_onset_date\": \"3 years ago\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"current_medications\": \"none\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc medial displacement | right disc medial displacement\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"joint_pain_present\": true, \"muscle_pain_location\": \"left masseter | left medial pterygoid\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"none\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \n"}

B431's TMJ problems she believes she began when she was about 13 years of age of unknown etiology. She had orthodontics from about the age of 12 through 15. She gets headaches about once every 2 weeks at about a level of 3 that are predominantly on the right side in the temporal area and up towards the top of the head. She is not aware of any TMJ pain and her average pain around the head and neck area is about a 1. She rates her jaw function at 2, diet at 1, disability at 1. She takes no medications. She has no earaches, occasional tinnitus, frequently vertigo, but no hearing loss. The left knee bothers her. She is allergic to cats and bee stings and has no known allergy to jewelry. She clenches and grinds her teeth at night and also during the day. She is predominantly a mouth breather particularly at night but is unaware of snoring, although she does have some mild daytime somnolence. She is not aware of any sleep apnea problem.\n\nIn frontal view, B431 has fairly good symmetry in the middle and upper third place, but has asymmetry in the lower third face. The upper length is about 18 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 0. The maxillary dental midline is slightly to the left about 1 mm. The mandibular dental midline is also a little bit off to the left probably about 1 mm. Chin is shifted probably about 5 or 6 mm off towards the right side. The left side of the face is probably about 8 to 10 mm lower than the right side. In profile, she has about 2 to 3 mm of AP maxillary deficiency. In the mandible, the chin appears to have reasonably good projection, but she does have a prominent labial mental fold. The chin does appear a little bit strong compared to the lower lip by maybe 2 to 3 mm. B431 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars in both the upper and lower jaw. She is basically a Class I cuspid molar relationship. She has a significant transverse cant in the occlusal plane. The right cuspids are at least 4 mm higher on the right side than the left side. The lower right cuspid is about 1 to 2 mm posterior to the left cuspid in both upper and lower arches. She has slight increased fullness in the left mandibular angle area on the left side compared to the right side. There appears to be a little bit of a posterior yaw in both the maxillary and mandibular arches being shifted towards the left side about 2 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Intranasally, at least anteriorly the turbinates appear relatively normal and septum appears reasonably straight. She does have about a 3 mm anterior over bite relationship. To palpation, she has some very mild tenderness over the TMJ areas. The incisal opening is 68 mm and opening without discomfort 50 mm. The excursion movements are 13 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has a root canal on the maxillary left first molar. Sinuses look relatively clear.\n\nCoronal view shows that the septum does deviate a little bit off towards the right side in the bony area. The turbinates appear enlarged on the left side. The right-sided turbinates are more normal in size.\n\nAxial view shows that the sinuses are clear. The left turbinate is hyperplastic and the right one appears relatively normal in size. The septum appears reasonably straight in this view.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has a relatively normal mediolateral width. Vertical height is not too abnormal. The joint space looks reasonably good, although it is decreased at the lateral aspect.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with fairly reasonably morphology. The joint space looks reasonably good.\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have a little sclerosis on the top of it. The joint space looks fairly good. The articular eminence is moderately steep. Condylar head may be somewhat longer than the opposite site.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle with fairly good morphology. There is good joint space surrounding it. The articular eminence is slightly more shallow than the right side.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B431 has a low mandibular occlusal plane facial morphology. The left side of the mandible is lower than the right side by probably 5 to 6 mm. There is a vertical difference at the occlusal plane level as well. The maxilla and mandible appear to be AP deficient, although the chin is relatively prominent. Oropharyngeal airway looks fairly good. The turbinates extend posterior to the hard palate. She has a low occlusal plane angle, but basically a Class I skeletal and occlusal relationship.\n\nBasic diagnoses would be as follows:\nLeft mandibular condylar osteochondroma. Rule out articular disc dislocations.\nMaxillary AP and right-sided vertical hypoplasia. Mandibular asymmetry being longer on the left side and shorter on the right side. Transverse cant in the occlusal plane with the right side being shorter than the left side.\nClass I occlusion.\nLeft nasal turbinate hyperplasia with nasal airway obstruction.

B111 is in good health with no major medical problems. Her TMJ problems began when she was about 14 years of age shortly after she got out of orthodontic treatment. B111 had orthodontic treatment from the age of 11 to 13. She believes her TMJ problems began when she was about 14 years old shortly after her appliances were removed. Her jaw has slowly become more retruded. She has had TMJ problems for approximately 20 years. She gets periods times now where her jaw will get stuck where she cannot open it. She has a lot of grinding in her joints and occasionally will have a significant pop. She has no real significant problems with headaches, but she has TMJ pain at a level of 5, average daily pain at 5 predominantly through the jaw muscles, and she rates her jaw function at 6, diet at 6, and disability at 5. She has no problems with earaches, gets occasional tinnitus and vertigo. Other joints that bother her include her shoulders, hips, wrists, and fingers. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at night. She takes the following medications:\n\nIbuprofen Zyrtec p.r.n. BCP.\nPrimary concerns that B111 has include the following:\nTMJ pain. Muscle and jaw pain. Difficulties eating and chewing.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn the frontal view, B111 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is 5 mm. The maxillary midline is on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline and chin are probably 1 mm off to the left side. In profile view, B111 is probably about 4 mm AP deficient in the maxilla and the chin is retruded about 15 mm. Chin neckline is very short and chin neck angle is not well defined. Intraorally, B111 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has appliances on that reach all the way to the second molars. The teeth appear to be nicely aligned and leveled. She has some lack of attached gingiva around the lower anterior, particularly the left central incisor that is developing a Stillman's cleft in that area. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars present and they also appear to be nicely aligned. She has a Class I end-on cuspid relationship that is slightly worse on the left side than the right side. She is probably 3 mm Class III. She has about a 2 mm overjet. She has an anterior deep bite of about 2 mm. The transverse occlusal plane is fairly level. Oropharyngeal tissues appear normal and healthy. The nasal airway looks fine. Turbinates are mildly to moderately enlarged, but B111 puts no nasal airway obstruction. She also does not snore nor does she have daytime somnolence. She is predominantly a nasal breather at night. She may have a slightly head postured forward neck position. To palpation, B111 has some mild tenderness over the temporalis muscles, but nowhere else to palpation. On opening, she has significant crepitus in both TMJ joints with no evidence of disc reduction. Incisal opening is 50 mm and 35 mm without discomfort. Excursion movements are 10 mm in each direction. B111 finds it difficult to keep her teeth together, but also difficult to open up and hold her mouth open.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars and braces on all the rest of the teeth. The sinuses appear relatively clear. Both condyles appear arthritic. Axial view shows that the sinuses are clear, but the inferior turbinates look quite large and appear to constrict the airway. In coronal view, the turbinates likewise appear quite large, although the bony septum is fairly straight. Sinuses are clear. Left TMJ tomograms show that she has advanced arthritis and sclerosis and osteophytic formation on the head of the condyle. She has significant anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is fairly steep. Right TMJ tomogram shows also advanced arthritis with significant anterior beaking. There is decreased vertical joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Sclerosis is present on the head of the condyle. Left TMJ coronal view shows that the condyle has fairly good mediolateral width, but advanced arthritis is present. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly fairly significantly, probably 4 to 5 mm. There is significantly decreased joint space and it appears that there is bone-on-bone contact at the lateral rim of the fossa. Right TMJ coronal view also shows advanced arthritic changes and significantly decreased vertical joint space. The lateral pole of the condyle is significantly lower positioned as compared to the medial pole. There is very minimal joint space, and there is bone-on-bone contact between the condyle and the lateral rim of the fossa. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B111 has a retruded maxilla and significantly retruded mandible. She has a high occlusal plane angle. Her oropharyngeal airway is only about 3 mm at the soft palate level and 4 mm at the base of the tongue (normal dimension is 11 mm).\n\nB111's orthodontist is Dr. XXXX.\nBasic diagnoses for B111 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ severe arthritis. AP mandibular hypoplasia.\nAP maxillary hypoplasia.\nAnterior vertical maxillary hyperplasia.\nHigh occlusal plane angle.\nClass II end-on occlusion. Decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 3.5 mm (normal 11 mm).\nTMJ pain. Difficulties eating and chewing. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of approximately 1.5 to 2 mm.\nOver angulation of the lower incisors.\nLack of attached gingiva in lower anterior arch with development of a Stillman's cleft around the left central incisor.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPeriodontal evaluation and grafting to lower anterior arch. Presurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing about 2 mm of tooth structure and retract. CT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol). Surgery.\nBilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement in a counterclockwise direction with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses.

She is aware that she does clench her teeth at night, and she usually wakes up with headaches and soreness in her jaws. She gets headaches in the frontal and temporal areas that she registers at about a level of 4. She rates her TMJ pain at 5, average daily pain at 5, jaw function at 5, diet at 6, and disability at 2.\\\n\nB349's problems may have begun as long as 8 to 9 years ago when she would wake up with headaches. However, it has only been over the past two years that she has been aware of having clicking and popping noises in her jaw joints.\n\nCurrent Medications\nAdderall 20 mg\nProzac 25 mg 1 time a week\nPatient Concerns\nJaw joint noises\nHeadaches\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B349 has good facial symmetry and balance. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 4 to 5 mm.\n\nIn profile view, she has fairly good facial balance. May be just some slight AP deficiency in the chin area of probably about 4 to 5 mm.\nIntraorally, B349 has all of her teeth back through the second molars erupted in, and the right third tooth are just peeking through a little bit. In the upper arch, she has all of her upper teeth back through the second molars. She has a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. Has similar facets on the upper cuspids. Oropharynx is clear. Teeth are in good repair. Has about a 2-mm anterior overbite relationship.\n\nTo palpation, she has some mild tenderness over the masseters, TMJs, and styloid areas.\nOn opening, she has a click at about 30 mm of opening and reciprocal click at about 20 in the right joint. Left joint seems to function reasonably smoothly. I could not detect any particular noises in excursive movements. Maximal incisal opening is about 55 mm but only about 25 mm with reasonable comfort. Excursive movements are 9 mm in each direction.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows the presence of all four third molars with three of them being bony impacted and the right third molar being partially soft tissue impacted. Sinuses look clear. Turbinates look relatively normal in size. Condyles appear a little bit flattened anteriorly.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has reasonably good morphology. Joint space may be a little bit decreased superiorly and posteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is a little bit flattened anteriorly. Decreased superior and posterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of both condyles with the condyles coming significantly anteriorly to the articular eminence.\nCephalometrically, B349 has basically a Class I skeletal and occlusal relationship. Bony chin might be slightly retruded. Some adenoid tissue remaining in the nasopharynx.

Relatively shallow downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa of about 2 mm. Appears to be discal tissue medial to the condyle. Cortical bone appears to be intact.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Moderate downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. There is a decreased joint space vertically. Appears to be discal tissue anterior to the condyle.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view: These actually were not included, and this reading is being done off of the opening sequence. Condyle appears to have a fairly good shape, but there is a little bit of anterior beaking and a little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Condyle appears to be posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Disc is not readily visible.\n\nOn opening, there appears to be reduction of the disc and good translation of the condyle.\nAddendum: Left TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle with some flattening of the anterior head. Condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced but appears to be in better position over medially.

Her problems began at the age of 53. Her dentist told her that she needed some spacing closed or she would have difficulties in the future. This started a major downhill slide leaving B499 severely compromised. She went from having a relatively normal occlusion to where she has just some retained roots of the maxillary first and second molars bilaterally with two remaining implants in the upper jaw and missing mandibular left central incisor and left first molar. All four third molars are absent. At one point, there were ten implants placed in the upper jaw and eight of them have now been removed with only two remaining. B499 has very methodically outlined her treatment to date.\n\nB499 rates her headaches at about a level of 8 in the frontal and temporal area bilaterally. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 8, diet at 5, disability at 9. She gets earaches on the left side occasionally, but has continuous tinnitus. She gets occasional vertigo and has hearing loss in the left ear. She has left leg stress fractures and also this involves the left side of her foot. She has right shoulder problems as well as hip problems. She has chronic left side fatigue. She is aware of clenching her teeth during the day, but not aware as to whether she does it at night.\n\nTo palpation, she has high moderate pain over the TMJs and moderate pain over the masseters, posterior neck, and mild discomfort over the shoulders. On opening she has a click on both sides with the right side being somewhat softer than the left side. On the left side, the opening click is at about 20 mm and a closing click at 15 mm. On the right side, the opening click is probably a little bit earlier at 15 with a closing click at about 10.

Consultation with Dr. XXXX.\nOrthodontics on the lower arch to align and level the lower arch, opening up space for the missing left central incisor as well as space around the deformed left cuspid. This will tip the lower incisors forward into a better position over basal bone. Surgery Stage 1: Bone grafting to maxilla including sinus lift procedures as well as augmenting anteriorly and vertically on the alveolar ridge. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.\nOsteointegrated dental implant placement to include four or more implants. The current maxillary implants will likely require removal.\nSurgery Stage 2: Placement of interosseus implants.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B176", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B176\nB176 is 44 years old and referred by Dr. XXXX. Her dentist is Dr. XXXX. She currently takes the following medications:\nWellbutrin 300 mg XL. Yasmin.\nAmbien 10 mg q.h.s.\n\nB176 has been on the Wellbutrin for 7 years.\nB176's primary concerns are as follows:\nClicking in the jaw joints. Crossbite. Headaches and TMJ pain.\nB176 had orthodontics x2 from the age of 12 to 14 and then from age of 15 to 17. She had a bicuspid extracted from each quadrant. It is unknown when her TMJ problems began and the etiology is unknown. B176 gets headaches about once a week behind the right eye which would include the frontal and temporal area. She rates her TMJ pain at 3, average daily pain at 3, jaw function at 4, diet at 0, disability at 0. She gets occasional right-sided earaches, occasional right-sided tinnitus, and she does have some right-sided hearing loss. The only other joints that bother her are her ankles. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at night and also during the day. She has had previous nose, sinus, septum, and turbinate work by Dr. XXXX. B176 is not aware of snoring, but she does have moderate daytime somnolence and she is predominantly a mouth breather at night time and also during the day. She is not aware of having any sleep apnea issues.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B176 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3.5 mm. The maxillary midline, mandibular dental midline, and chin midline are all fairly well aligned with each other. In profile view, she has some slight AP maxillary deficiency and some slight AP mandibular deficiency of probably about 4 mm. Chin neckline is a little bit short and chin neck angle is not well defined. She has a slightly head postured forward neck position. Intraorally, she is missing what appears to be probably the first bicuspids in all four quadrants. She is basically a Class I cuspid relationship with bilateral posterior crossbites. She has about a 1 mm overbite and 1 mm overjet. Oropharyngeal tissues all look normal. Intranasally, there is some mucous material that makes it difficult to evaluate, but turbinates appear relatively normal as best as I can see them in the front. The septum may be reasonably straight. She has constricture of the luminal valves. The nostrils are somewhat narrow. Holding the nostrils open with a nasal scope significantly improved her abilities to breathe through her nose. She currently has moderate nasal airway obstruction. Both maxillary and mandibular arches are quite narrow and constricted. To palpation, she has no tenderness around the head and neck area. She has a click in the left joint at about 10 mm of opening and 5 mm of closing. The right side seems to function reasonably smoothly. Incisal opening is 47 mm and excursion movements are 7 mm in each direction.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars and four first bicuspids. She has root canals on mandibular second molars bilaterally and maxillary left first and second molar and right first molar. Coronal view shows that her turbinates have essentially totally removed in the anterior and mid part of the nose, but there is still some inferior turbinate tissue posteriorly but there appears to be adequate airway. Sinuses appear clear. There is a septal perforation present. Axial view shows that the septum is reasonably straight with just a little deviation off towards the left side. There is some residual inferior turbinate bilaterally at the posterior aspect of the nose. Sinuses appear clear. Left TMJ sagittal view shows condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology with just some slight anterior beaking. Joint space appears reasonably good. Right TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that there is decrease superior and anterior joint space. There appears to be in one view a little erosion on the anterior head of the condyle. The joint spaces seem less on this side compared to the opposite side. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with moderately good mediolateral width. There is decreased lateral joint space. Lateral rim of the fossa curves downward probably 4 mm. Right TMJ coronal view shows significantly decreased vertical joint space and almost bone-on-bone contact at the lateral aspect of the joint. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 3-4 mm. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows B176 has some moderate AP maxillary and mandibular deficiency. Oropharyngeal airway at the soft palate level measures about 8 mm, but at the base of the tongue there are some areas that measure about 3 mm to 6 mm.\n\nDental model analysis shows that there is only about 1 mm of vertical overbite relationship. There are bilateral posterior crossbites. The four bicuspids have been removed. The maxilla appears to be approximately 10-12 mm deficient transversely in the second molar area. B176 has a tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B176 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation with reduction on the left side and probably nonreducing on the right side. Maxillary significant transverse hypoplasia and to a lesser degree AP hypoplasia. Mandibular AP hypoplasia. Bilateral posterior crossbites.\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway.\nTMJ pain. Headaches. Bilateral collapse of the nasal luminal valves.\nNasal airway obstruction. Recommended treatment would be as follows:\n\nMRI of left and right TMJs.\nPresurgical orthodontics. Align and level maxillary arch. Tip lateral incisor roots mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Surgery. Bilateral TMJ reconstruction (method will be dependent on MRI findings).\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla forward and significantly expand it. Reconstruct nasal luminal valves with bone grafts from posterior maxilla.\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB176 MRI AGE: 44/F\nLeft TMJ frontal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width and good vertical height. There is decreased lateral joint space. There disc is medially displaced. There could be some anterior displacement of the articular discs.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width and vertical height. It appears that the joint space is decreased vertically, although there may be some discal tissue in pace. There appears to be some decreased lateral joint space and so the disc also may be medially displaced.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. A little bit of flattening on the anterior head. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The articular disc is not seen out laterally, bur more medially it appears to be in reasonably good position, although perhaps just slightly forward. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space, but not too significant. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc does reduce into a good position.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows out lateral the disc is not as readily identifiable. More medially, there appears to be better imaging of the disc, although the disc appears quite thin in all the views with a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space, but not too significant. On opening, there is good translation of the condyle and the disc appears to be in a reduced position and translates well with the condyle.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.

She had orthodontics from about the age of 12 to 16 and this included extraction of four bicuspids including the mandibular second bicuspids, maxillary first bicuspids. B130 has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, nor hearing loss. The only other joints that bother her are her back. She has some clenching during the day.\n\nB130 rates her headarches at a level of 8 and they occur in the frontal, temporal, and top of the head. She rates her average TMJ pain at 5, daily pain at 6, jaw function at 6, diet at 5, disability at 3.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\nIn frontal view, B130 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 20 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 8 mm. The maxillary, mandibular, and chin midline are all pretty much on the facial midline. The nasal tip is deviated just slightly to the right side by 1 to 2 mm. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is probably about 3 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is probably 6 to 8 mm AP deficient. The chin may be retruded about 10 mm. Chin neckline, however, looks fairly strong. The chin is strong compared to the AP position of the lower lip. Chin sticks out probably 6 mm beyond the lower lip. Intraorally, B130 is missing the lower second bicuspids. Molars are actually tipped lingually creating increased curve of Wilson. The lower anterior teeth are well aligned. She has adequate attached gingiva. In the upper arch, she has a reversed curve of Spee. She is missing upper first bicuspids. Upper incisors appear as though they are almost in lingual inclination. B130 is fairly close to a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. She has an anterior deep bite of about 6 mm. Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and normal. Intranasally, the septum appears relatively straight. Turbinates appear enlarged and appear significantly inflamed. There may be some moderate constricture of the luminal valves. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the left TMJ, retromandibular area, left masseter, bilateral shoulders, and milder tenderness over the right TMJ and right retromandibular area. On opening, she has a click in the left joint at about 15 to 20 mm and a closing click at 10. The right side seems to function reasonably smoothly. Maximal opening is 56 mm, opening without discomfort 40 mm. Excursion movement to the right 9 mm, to the left 10 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the presence of impacted mandibular third molars, but absence of maxillary third molars. Mandibular second bicuspids and maxillary first bicuspids are also missing. Sinuses appear reasonably clear, although there could be some polyps in the right sinus. Septum in the bony area is deviated off significantly towards the right side. The left condyle appears a little flattened anteriorly with a little peaking at the superior aspect of the condyle. Right side appears more normal. Coronal view shows that the turbinates are moderate in size. Septum is deviated significantly off towards the left side. There is a sinus polyp hanging down from the right infraorbital rim.\nAxial view shows that the septum is deviated off towards the left side. Turbinates appear moderate in size. Sinuses appear relatively clear at the one cut that I have to evaluate. Right TMJ sagittal view shows condyle that has reasonably good morphology. There appears to be fairly well balanced joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Left TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle is posteriorly positioned in the fossa, particularly at the lateral aspect of the joint with increased anterior joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. There appears to be some decrease lateral joint space. Vertical joint space also appears somewhat narrow in areas. Left TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appear may be just slightly smaller in size than the right side. Vertical joint space may be slightly decreased. Lateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B130 has a retruded maxilla and mandible, but has AP macrogenia probably in part due to previous orthodontic treatment. Oropharyngeal airway is slightly constricted with an AP dimension at the soft palate level of about 8 mm and at the base of the tongue of 5 mm. She has a slight increased occlusal plane angle and an anterior deep bite. The roots are quite short on the incisors. Upper incisors are retro-inclined.\n\nBasic diagnoses would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction. AP maxillary hypoplasia.\nVertical maxillary hyperplasia. AP mandibular hypoplasia.\nAP macrogenia. Headaches. TMJ pain. Impacted mandibular third molars x2.\nMissing maxillary first bicuspids and mandibular second bicuspids.\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway. Hypertrophied turbinates. Deviated nasal septum.\nNasal airway obstruction. Snoring. Resorbed roots on the maxillary incisors. Polyps, right maxillary sinus.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlign and level the maxillary arch. Tip the lateral incisors mesially and cuspid roots distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level the mandibular arch.\nSurgery. Bilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.\nMaxillary osteotomies to move the maxilla superiorly approximately 6 mm and advance it forward approximately 6 to 8 mm. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a slight clockwise direction.\nAnterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to reduce the prominence in the chin. Surgical removal of mandibular impacted third molars x2. Bilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Nasal septoplasty.\nRemoval of nasal polyps from right maxillary sinus. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB130 MRI AGE: 26/F\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good morphology. Joint space appears decreased vertically. Discs appear that they may be anteromedially displaced.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has good mediolateral width. Joint space may be just slightly wider, but difficult to tell. Discs may be anteriorly displaced, but kind of difficult to tell on the coronal views.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that appears to have fairly good morphology. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, the disc reduces and there is good translation of both the condyle and the disc.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has fairly good morphology. The disc may be just slightly anteriorly displaced at the lateral aspect of the joint. The head is a little bit flattened on the anterior slope at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the disc appears to be in better position. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. On opening, there is good translation and early reduction of the articular disc.\n\nIMPRESSION:\nLeft TMJ articular disc dislocation with early reduction.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B495", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B495\nB495 is 43 years old and is referred by Dr. XXXX\nPRIMARY PROBLEMS:\nTMJ pain.\nHeadaches.\nDifficulties eating and chewing.\nSleep apnea problems. Ear pain.\nFeeling of choking.\nDifficulty swallowing. Even when drinking water she will choke.\nB495 has been diagnosed with acid reflux and recently had a procedure to expand her esophagus to breakup some adhesions. This helped her swelling for a short time but her difficulties are back again.\n\nB495 is not really sure when her jaw joint problems began. She says her lower jaw has always been somewhat retruded. However, she feels it has become much more receded in the past 5 years. She developed sleep apnea problems during the past 5 years. She was placed on a CPAP machine but she is unable to tolerate it. The CPAP machine significantly aggravates her allergies and her aspergillosis, a fungal infection of the lungs. Seven years ago, at about the age of 39, she noted the joint problems progressing. However, it was not until last August that she developed severe pain problems. She was put in physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks and this seemed to help her muscle spasms but has not reduced her pain levels. B495 has had splint therapy for approximately 10 years. This obviously has not corrected her situation.\n\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\nIbuprofen 800 mg tablets. She limits herself to 1 a day because it causes GI problems. Q-Var inhaler. Albuterol.\nPrednisone periodically as needed for her symptoms.\nNexium.\n\nB495 rates her TMJ pain at a level of 9, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 5, diet at 7, disability at 6. She gets headaches predominately in the right temporal and posterior head area at a level of 7. She gets a headache at least every other day. She does find that she clenches at night and also during the day. She gets earaches worse on the left side than the right side and they are fairly continuous. She also gets tinnitus and she gets occasional vertigo. No other joints bother her. She does have a history of breast cancer that was diagnosed in the fall, 11 years a go. She had a left mastectomy and subsequently had a breast implant placed. She has done well since that treatment.\n\nIn frontal view, B495 has some transverse facial asymmetry. She has more fullness on the right side of her face than the left side. Upper lip length is about 3.5 to 4 mm. B495 states that the right side increased fullness may be due to swelling and it tends to become more prominent and less prominent but it stays more full on the right side. B495 says she used to be more symmetric than she is now. It is possible there could be some slight masseteric hyperplasia there. Maxillary and mandibular midlines are fairly well centered. She has lip incompetence of about 6 mm. In profile view, upper lip supralabrale is posterior to subnasale by probably 2 to 3 mm. She probably has a maxillary deficiency of probably 4 to 6 mm. Chin appears to be retruded by at least 15 to 18 mm. Chin-neckline and angle are well formed. Intraorally, she has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. The uvula appears normal size and shape but the soft palate appears elongated with a very narrow oropharyngeal space remaining. Faucial pillars appear normal. She had her tonsils previously removed when she was 7 years old. Transversely the occlusal plane is fairly level. She has some significant crowding in the lower anterior arch. Mandibular left lateral incisor is completely lingually blocked. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Slight division II angulation of the incisors. She has a Class II end-on occlusion being worse on the left side as compared to the right side. She has an overjet of about 4 mm. Anterior vertical overlap of about 2 mm. Oropharyngeal area tissues look healthy. She has severe snoring. She has severe daytime somnolence and could fall asleep while driving and also at work. She has severe sleep apnea symptoms and apparently has significant occurrences of cessation of breathing at night while she is sleeping. Intranasally, the septum appears fairly straight. Turbinates appear fairly large. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the TMJs and mild tenderness over the styloid areas, but no other significant discomfort around the head and neck area. With jaw function, she feels squishy noises in her joints. On reassessment of B495 in centric relation, she is actually very significantly Class II bilaterally. In the first assessment she was postured a little bit off towards the left side. The midlines and chin are all fairly well aligned in centric relation. The overjet is actually about 5 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n:\nPanorex shows the absence of all 4 third molars, but all the rest of the teeth are present. The sinuses appear reasonably clear. Condyles appear small in size and a little bit arthritic.\n\nWaters view shows that the bony septum has a little bit of deviation in it. Turbinates appear moderately enlarged although there does appear that there may be airspace but all sinuses appear clear.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows that there appears to be decreased joint space. Condyles appear arthritic. Very difficult to view probably due to small size of the condyles.\n\nRight TMJ tomograms show that the condyle is likely arthritic but there appears to be an increased joint space on this side vertically and the condyle is postured slightly forward. On opening, there is moderately good translation of both condyles with perhaps a little bit more on the right side than the left side.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that both the maxilla and mandible are retruded. She has a severely decreased oropharyngeal airway of less than 2 mm at the soft palate level and at the base of the tongue is only about 2 mm (normal is 11 mm.)\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES:\nBilateral TMJ severe arthritis with significant condylar resorption.\nAP maxillary deficiency.\nAnterior vertical maxillary excess.\nPosterior vertical maxillary deficiency. Severe AP mandibular deficiency.\nClass II end-on occlusion. Significant crowding of lower anterior arch.\nSeverely decreased oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 1 to 2 mm (normal dimension 11 mm.)\nSevere sleep apnea (life threatening.) TMJ pain. Headaches. Ear pain and tinnitus. Tooth size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm. Hypertrophied turbinates. Partial nasal airway obstruction.\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlign and level maxillary arch. Keep lateral incisor roots tipped mesially and cuspid roots tipped distally to make room for interdental osteotomies. Align and level mandibular arch. Slenderize the lower anterior teeth removing at least 2 mm of tooth structure to correct for the tooth size discrepancy and to help keep the lower incisors from being flared too far forward.\nCT scan (TMJ Concepts protocol.)\nSurgery.\nBilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. Multiple maxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla, expand it and downgraft it posteriorly.\nBilateral TMJ fat grafts.\nBilateral mandibular coronoidectomies.\nBilateral partial inferior turbinectomies. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nThe husband notes that he frequently observes his wife holding her breath for a minute or longer between breaths when sleeping.\nB495 MRI EVALUATION \nAge: 43/F\nDOB:\n\nDate of Acquisition:\nDate of Interpretation:\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe resorption. Significant loss of condylar volume. The condyle appears narrow with medial beaking. There is increased soft tissue space. The fossa appears in some areas to have a little bit of degeneration but difficult to tell. There is moderate downward curvature at the lateral rim of the fossa of probably about 3 to 4 mm. There may be discal tissue anterior and medial.\n\nRight TMJ shows a condyle that is also quite small in mediolateral width. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 to 3 mm. There is significantly less joint space on this side compared to the opposite side. There may be some discal tissue anterior in this joint. A little bit more sclerosis on the top of condyle as compared to the opposite side. It appears there may be some degenerative changes in the fossa as well.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone significant condylar resorption. There are osteophytes remaining on the superior head and anterior on the head of the condyle. There are some degenerative changes in the fossa in some areas. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and severely deformed. It is very short anteroposteriorly and it actually appears like a round ball. Articular eminence is fairly long and steep. There is significant fluid in the superior joint space and the soft tissues are exceptionally thick in the joint area. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle but the disc remains anteriorly displaced and severely deformed. There still remains almost excessive joint space in the open view.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows significant condylar resorption and loss of volume. It appears that the cuts through the joint are done at an odd angle compared to how they are usually done. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Decreased superior joint space. Condyle appears to be posteriorly positioned. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and severely deformed and degenerated. In some areas, the articular eminence appears fairly flat with changes in the fossa with significant degenerative changes of the condyle. There is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space although not as much as the opposite side. On opening, there is moderate translation and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.\n\nIMPRESSION:\n1.\tBilateral TMJ severe arthritis and severe degeneration of the articular discs.\n2.\tProbable candidate for total joint prostheses.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 43, \"diet_score\": 7, \"disability_rating\": 6, \"sleep_apnea_diagnosed\": true, \"jaw_function_score\": 5, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"neck_pain_present\": false, \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching\", \"physical_therapy_status\": \"physical therapy for 6 to 8 weeks\", \"earache_present\": true, \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"at least every other day\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": true, \"muscle_pain_score\": \"mild\", \"headache_location\": \"right temporal | posterior head\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 8, \"headache_intensity\": \"7 | present\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"unknown but worsened last august\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 9, \"sleep_disorder_type\": \"sleep apnea | sleep apnea symptoms | snoring | daytime somnolence | sleep apnea symptoms\", \"current_medications\": \"ibuprofen | q-var inhaler | albuterol | prednisone | nexium\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anteriorly displaced | right disc anteriorly displaced without reduction\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"styloid areas\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"splint for approximately 10 years\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"maximum_opening_without_pain\": \"45mm\", \"patient_age\": 43, \"maximum_opening\": \"45mm\", \"diet_score\": 7, \"disability_rating\": 6, \"jaw_function_score\": 5, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": true, \"earache_present\": true, \"adverse_reactions\": \"aspirin\", \"muscle_pain_score\": \"moderate\", \"headache_frequency\": \"every other day\", \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"clenching\", \"earache_location\": \"left ear\", \"onset_triggers\": \"anterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | right posterior open bite | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | severe arthritis | severe arthritis | severe arthritis | severe arthritis | severe | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | right tmj | right tmj | left tmj |"}

B103 had an onset of her TMJ problems at the age of 14 probably related to AICR. She did have an accident of age of 7 on a diving board where she hit the underneath of her chin and damaged some of her primary teeth. She had orthodontics from the age of 11 to 12 and then again from the age of 14 to 15. She had her third molars removed at the age of 15. At the age of 16, she had double jaw surgery by Dr. XXXX. That same year she also had a nasal septoplasty and an external rhinoplasty. She has been in splint therapy for 14 years and estimates she has had 20 to 30 splints. Following completion of her orthodontics, her bite did open again. After the surgery, the bite opened once again. B103 rates her headaches at a level of 7 that occur in the temporal areas bilaterally. They occur at a rate of two times per day. She wakes up with the headaches and then in the afternoon around 5 o'clock the headaches begin again. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 8, jaw function at 2, diet at 3, disability at 7. She gets occasional earaches, gets tinnitus about 2 times per week, but has no vertigo or known hearing loss. Other joints that bother her include her wrists and her neck. She is aware of clenching and bruxing at nighttime. She takes the following medications:\n\nLexapro 10 mg q.d.\nAdvil 1200 mg p.r.n.\nIn frontal view, B103 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry.

Oropharyngeal tissues look healthy and normal with the soft palate appearing maybe a little bit elongated with a deep crease dimension perhaps from the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall. Intranasally, the turbinates appear relatively normal in size and the septum appears reasonably straight. There appears to be good nasal airway. To palpation, she has some moderate discomfort over the TMJs and milder tenderness over the temporalis, masseters, medial pterygoids, and SCMs. The maximal incisal opening is 47 mm but 25 mm without discomfort. Excursion movements to the right is 9 mm, to the left 8 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. There are four bone plates in each side, but each bone plate only has two screws with one screw above and one screw below the osteotomy site. There are two screws in the left ramus, but none in the right ramus but apparently these were removed. She has two screws in the chin area. She had root canals on the maxillary left second bicuspid, right cuspid, first bicuspid, and mandibular right cuspid and left first molar.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B356", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B356 \nDate of Birth: \nThe patient is a 16-year-old female referred by Dr. __.\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: B356 states that her jaw joint problems began about 1-1/2 years ago of unknown etiology. She became aware of some clicking and popping in her joints and also started to develop headache and pain problems. She has had no previous orthodontic treatment. She has had splint therapy. She takes ibuprofen as her only medication.\n\nPATIENT CONCERNS/PROBLEMS\nJaw and mouth pain. Headaches.\nJaws pop creating increased pain. Jaw locking.\nDifficulties eating and chewing.\nShe has no problems with earaches, tinnitus, vertigo or hearing loss. She has no other joints that bother her. She has been diagnosed as having ADD. She is aware of clenching and bruxism at nighttime. She apparently has fairly continuous headaches and usually wakes up with headaches. She rates the headaches at a level of 8 on the left side throughout the head area and a level of 6 on the right side. She rates her TMJ pain about at level of 8 and it does get to a 10. Average daily facial pain and headaches are about an 8. She rates her jaw function at 5, diet at 5 and disability at 7. To palpation, she has moderate tenderness over the masseters and TMJs. Incisal opening is about 40 mm according to some early information provided by Dr. __. Photographs were sent. She appears to have fairly good facial symmetry in the frontal view. In profile she also appears to have good facial symmetry. In occlusal view, midlines are off by about 1/2 to 1 mm. She appears to have about a 3 mm vertical overbite relationship anteriorly. She appears to have a crossbite tendency bilaterally in the posterior aspect. She has a Class II end-on occlusion of about 3 mm in right cuspid area and probably 1 mm perhaps on the left side, although she appears to have more of a Class II molar relationship on the left side. Phone evaluation was interesting because today B356  was at her home ill because of the flu and has been throwing up. I actually talked to her through her mother and aunt whom were both at the aunt's home but then had to call B356 at her and her mother's home and we had to relay the questions through a third party.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the presence of all four third molars. Sinuses appear clears. Rami are cut off so I could not evaluate the joints. It appears that she may have an accentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch and a reverse curve of occlusion in the upper arch.\n\nSome right TMJ films are present and it appears the condyle may be posteriorly displaced but hard to tell. Articular eminence appears moderately steep.\n\nLeft TMJ films show a condyle that appears to have perhaps some arthritic changes but the quality of the film is not real good so it is very difficult to tell. B356 \n\nMRI showed that she has some bilateral TMJ arthritis with some erosions and the articular disc is dislocated without reduction and significantly deformed and degenerated. The left side appears worse than the right side. However, she claims that she has clicking and popping in her joint which means that perhaps with normal function that the joints still click and pop thus reducing whereas on the MRI because of the situation the disc did not reduce.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocation without reduction.\nRelative mandibular hyperplasia.\nSevere TMJ pain.\nSevere headaches.\nMyofascial pain.\nMasticatory dysfunction. Impacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x4.\nAccentuated curve of occlusion in the lower arch and slightly reverse curve of occlusion in the upper arch. Class II end-on occlusion.\nTendency towards posterior crossbites.\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlign and level maxillary arch. Try to expand the posterior arch particularly in the bicuspid area to eliminate the tendency towards posterior crossbite. Create about 1 mm of space around each of the upper lateral incisors as it appears that there is a tooth size discrepancy.\nAlign and level mandibular arch. Surgery.\nBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors.\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to maintain Class I occlusion.\nSurgical removal of impacted third molars x4.\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB356  MRI Evaluation \nDate of Birth: \nDate of Acquisition: \nDate of Interpretation: \nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have undergone some resorptive changes. In the mid part of the condyle there is decreased superior joint space. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 3 to 4 mm. It could be even up to about 4 mm as we come more anteriorly. Decreased superior joint space. In one area there appears to be a little calcification or a little osteophyte towards the middle third of the condyle. It appears that there have been erosive changes at the lateral aspect of the condyle. Significantly decreased joint space at the lateral rim. Articular disc appears to be anteriorly displaced.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone even greater arthritic changes. It appears that there has been some significant erosion of the condyle at the lateral aspect and also across the medial aspect. There is some osteophytic formation extending superiorly in the mid part of the condyle. There is some lateral osteophytic development as well. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly probably about 4 to 5 mm. Decreased superior lateral joint spaces. It appears that there is disc tissue displaced anteriorly but somewhat more degenerated than the opposite side. The lateral pole of the condyle is significantly more inferiorly positioned than the medial pole.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal shows a condyle that laterally has erosion of the condylar head and some flattening on the anterior aspect of the condylar head. More medially, the condyle appears a little bit better shaped but it appears somewhat narrow anteroposteriorly. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Articular disc is anteriorly displaced and sitting down towards the inferior aspect of the eminence. It is more anteriorly displaced along the entire aspect of the condyle. Decreased superior and posterior joint spaces. The disc is significantly deformed and narrow anteroposteriorly as well as thickened. The posterior band is quite thick and the intermediate zone is extremely narrow. On opening, there is restricted translation and the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction. It is possible that this disc could be salvageable but there are significant degenerative changes preexisting.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has some significant erosions at the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the condyle has a little bit better morphology. There is anterior beaking more towards the medial aspect of the joint. There is decreased superior and posterior joint spacing. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There may be some erosion at the lateral aspect of the articular eminence. The disc is significantly degenerated much more so than the opposite side. The disc is more evident at the lateral aspect of the joint than at the medial aspect. However, the definition of the disc is very poor. It appears there is a little bit of fluid in the superior joint space. It is difficult to differentiate between the articular eminence and the disc at the lateral aspect of the joint. On opening, there is significant limitation of translation somewhat similar to the opposite side and the disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.\n\nIMPRESSION\nBilateral TMJ advanced arthritis and articular disc dislocations without reductions and significant deformation of the disc with the left side being worse than the right side.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B185", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B185\nB185 is 39 years old. He got my name off the Internet. He has had the previous surgical procedures:\nRhinoplasty.\nSliding genioplasty in approximately 14 years ago.\nFour months ago, double jaw surgery to advance the maxilla and mandible.\n\nPRIMARY CONCERNS: Sleep apnea.\nB185 had orthodontics done at the age of 18 with extraction of upper and lower first bicuspids and teeth retracted. He had repeat orthodontics at about the age of 30 to close up some residual space but this moves his teeth back even further. The double jaw surgery in 4 months ago was to correct his sleep apnea problems but B185 does not notice much difference or improvement. He still needs about 10 to 12 hours of sleep at night to even be able to function the next day and sometimes still his mind is foggy. He is getting very poor quality REM sleep.\n\nThe only medication that B185 takes is Clonazepam 0.5 mg tablets 1 to 2 tablets at bedtime.\nB185 has no problems with headaches, TMJ pain or myofacial pain. No trouble with earaches or vertigo but does have bilateral tinnitus. He has significant hearing loss and wears bilateral hearing aids. He is not aware of clenching or bruxing at night or during the day.\n\nCLINICAL EXAMINATION\n:\nIn frontal view, B185 has fairly good left to right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 22 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2 mm. Maxillary midline is fairly close to being on the facial midline. In profile view, B185 has some slight AP maxillary deficiency maybe about 3 to 4 mm. Infraorbital hypoplasia with the infraorbital rims being probably about 6 mm deficient. The chin is probably 12 to 15 mm AP deficient. Maxillary teeth actually are more retruded than the maxilla is because the teeth are retruded posteriorly fairly significantly. Intraorally, B185 is missing lower first bicuspids but has the rest of his teeth back through the second molars. The lower teeth are in a little bit in lingual inclination. It shows some of the root. In the upper arch, he is missing first bicuspids. He has the rest of the teeth back through the second molars. He has basically a Class II end-on cuspid relationship on the right side by probably 3 mm but on the left side closer to Class I relationship. He has probably about almost 5 mm vertical overbite. Oropharyngeal areas look reasonably healthy. There is evidence of a previous UPPP procedure and B185 remembered that he had that done in approximately 18 years ago, but experienced no improvement in his airway following that procedure. He also has tried the Thornton appliance but this did not improve the situation and actually only made his teeth loose. Intranasally, the septum appears fairly straight. He has probably had previous turbinectomies. Perhaps on the left side, however, there are some of the turbinates still remaining posteriorly but there does appear to be adequate air space inferior and there appears to be adequate airway on both sides. Even with the UPPP procedure, B185 is aware of having some mild snoring. He has some moderate to severe daytime somnolence. He has moderate to severe sleep apnea issues. TMJ joints seem to function smoothly. He has no apparent tenderness around the head and neck area.\n\nIncisal opening is about 42 mm counting the overbite. Excursive movements are about 9 mm in each direction and opening is 42 mm.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\n:\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars and all four first bicuspids. He has root canals on the maxillary left second molar and left lateral incisor. He has a crown on the maxillary left first molar and central and lateral incisors. There are bone plates present in the maxilla. Bone screws are present in the mandible. He has bone plates in the anterior mandible from his previous chin procedure. There are some bony defects present in that area. The condyles look reasonably good. The styloid processes are hypercalcified and elongated.\n\nWaters view shows that the right nasal airway appears wide open and the left one appears that there is some turbinate and that may be the area seen posteriorly and may obstruct that side some. The bony septum at least is straight. The sinuses look relatively clear.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows that the condyle appears narrow anteroposteriorly. There appears to be adequate joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows that there is probably adequate joint space. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Condyle is hard to identify. On opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyles.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that there is AP retrusion of maxilla and mandible. There is slight increase in the occlusal plane angle but too much. The chin is strong relative to AP position of the mandible. Upper incisors are actually angled posteriorly. Oropharyngeal airway measures less than 3 mm (normal AP dimension would be 11 mm.) At the soft palate level, the airway measures about 6 mm.\n\nBASIC DIAGNOSES: AP maxillary deficiency.\nAP mandibular deficiency.\nAP macrogenia.\nSignificantly decreased inclination of maxillary incisors. Missing all four first bicuspids and all four third molars.\nSeverely reduced oropharyngeal airway with an AP dimension of 2.5 mm (normal dimension of 11 mm.)\nSevere sleep apnea.\nModerately increased occlusal plane angle.\nClass II end-on occlusion on the right side but fairly close to being a Class I on the left side. Anterior deep bite of 5 mm. Previous double jaw surgery performed 4 months ago.\n\nRECOMMENDED TREATMENT:\nPresurgical orthodontics.\nAlign and level maxillary arch. Open up first bicuspid spacing by pushing the anterior teeth forward to increase angulation of the upper incisors as well as to distalize the posterior teeth at least a couple of mm. Open up the space to equal the size of a first bicuspid tooth approximately 7 mm. This should tip the upper incisors forward at least 5 mm from their current position.\nAlign and level mandibular arch. Surgery.\nMaxillary osteotomies to advance the maxilla about 2 to 3 mm and downgraft it posteriorly approximately 4 mm. Bilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible forward approximately 14 to 15 mm. Consider possible extraction of second molars if impingement on the discal tissues of the mandible.\nConsider possible anterior mandibular horizontal osteotomy to set the chin backwards about 3 to 4 mm. Removal of previously placed maxillary bone plates x4 and screws x22 as well as removal of mandibular bone plates x2 and screws x13.\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\nBilateral maxillary osteointegrated implants to the first bicuspid area.\nRestorative dentistry to place crowns on the maxillary first bicuspid implants.", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 39, \"maximum_opening\": \"42mm\", \"sleep_apnea_diagnosed\": true, \"tinnitus_present\": true, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": true, \"earache_present\": false, \"airway_obstruction_present\": \"false | true\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": false, \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"sleep_disorder_type\": \"daytime somnolence | snoring | sleep apnea | sleep apnea\", \"current_medications\": \"clonazepam\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics at age of 18 | orthodontics at age of 30 | thornton appliance\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 39, \"maximum_opening\": \"42mm\", \"diet_score\": 0, \"disc_displacement\": \"none\", \"pain_aggravating_factors\": \"none\", \"muscle_symptoms_present\": false, \"jaw_crepitus\": \"none\", \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": \"moderate to severe\", \"headache_frequency\": \"none\", \"current_medications\": \"clonazepam 0.5 mg tablets 1 to 2 tablets at bedtime\", \"disc_displacement\": \"none\", \"muscle_pain_score\": 0, \"current_appliance\": \"bilateral hearing aids\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"appliance_history\": \"orthodontics at age of 18, sliding genioplasty in approximately 14 years ago, double jaw surgery 4 months ago\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_location\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_rating\": 0, \"joint_pain_areas_pain_rating\": 0, \"joint_pain_areas_pain_onset_date\": \"none\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_onset_date\": \"none\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_onset_triggers\": \"none\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_onset_triggers\": \"none\", \"joint_pain_areas_pain_onset_date\": \"none\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_location\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas_location\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj\", \"muscle_pain_score\": 0, \"muscle_symptoms_present\": false, \"muscle_pain_location\": \"none\", \"muscle_pain_score\": 0, \"pain_onset_date\": \"none\", \"headache_location\": \"none\", \"headache_intensity\": 0, \"pain_"}
{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B064", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B064\nB064 is 22 years old. B064 was referred by XXXX. B064 problems began likely when she was 13 or 14 years of age. At the age of 14 is when she first became aware of clicking and popping in her joints. It was noted when she was wearing elastics for orthodontic reasons. She had orthodontics from age 14 to 17 years old. After removal of her appliances, she noted her bite was started to shift. She went back into orthodontics from age 19 to 20 years old. She had double jaw orthognathic surgery in two years ago by Dr. XXXX. Primary concerns that B064 has at this time include the following:\n\nLower jaw is becoming recessive again. Bite is opened anteriorly. Crepitus noises in the jaws. Painful jaw muscles.\nDrooling.\nHeadaches. Difficulties breathing through the nose.\n\nAdditional treatments that B064 has had includes chiropractic treatment, facial massage therapy, and speech therapy. The only medication she takes is Motrin for her pain.\n\nB064 gets headaches at about a level of 3 in the temporal and posterior head area. She rates her TMJ pain at 8, average daily pain at 4, jaw function and diet at 5, disability at 8. She gets occasional earaches, but no tinnitus, vertigo, or hearing loss. The only other joint that bothers her is her right shoulder. She is aware of clenching her teeth at night. She is predominantly a mouth breather particularly at night and to a moderate extent during the day. She is unaware of snoring, has mild daytime somnolence, but no sleep apnea. Post surgery, B064 did develop an infection in the left maxillary area and Dr. XXXX had to go in and remove the bone plate and screws.\n\nIn frontal view, B064 has fairly good left-to-right symmetry. Upper lip length is 21 mm. Upper tooth lip relationship is about 3.5 mm. The maxillary midline is slightly to the right about 1 mm. The mandibular dental midline is probably 2 mm to the right and so is the chin. Upper lip supralabrale is probably a good 3 mm posterior to subnasale. The maxilla is probably deficient about 6 to 8 mm. The mandible is retruded about 15-18 mm. The chin neckline is short. Intraorally, B064 has all of her lower teeth back through the second molars. She has a 3 x 3 lower retainer. She has very thin tissue around the anterior teeth that appears to be stable. In the upper arch, B064 has all of her teeth back through the second molars present. She has palatal tori present. She has a Class II end-on occlusion being approximately 4 or 5 mm Class II. She has an anterior open bite of about 2 mm. She has an overjet of about 3 mm. In centric relation, the mandibular dental midline is actually about 3 mm off towards the right side as is the chin. Oropharyngeal tissues look normal and healthy. Intranasally, the turbinates appear moderately enlarged and probably are blocking the airway. To palpation, she has moderate pain over the temporalis muscles, posterior neck and shoulders. She has audible crepitation particularly in the left joint, but also crepitation in the right joint. The maximal incisal opening is 51 mm, opening with comfort 32 mm. Excursion movement to the right 9 mm, to the left 10 mm. When B064 occludes, she hits only on the second molars and all other teeth are out of occlusion.\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars. She has four bone screws in the left ramus and three in the right ramus. The sinuses appear relatively clear. A 3 x 3 retainer can be seen in the lower arch.\n\nCoronal view shows that the turbinates are quite large. The septum is reasonably straight. Sinuses appear relatively clear.\nAxial view shows that there is a little deviation of the septum off towards the right side. The turbinates are quite large and appear to obstruct most of the nasal airway. The sinuses appear relatively clear.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows that she has severe arthritis in the left TMJ with significant loss of condylar volume. There are some small pseudocysts in the joint. The articular eminence is relatively flat.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view also has severe arthritis with significant loss of condylar volume. The articular eminence is slightly steeper on this side compared to the opposite side. The condyle is narrow mediolaterally.\n\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe arthritic changes. The fossa also has undergone significant arthritic changes. There is a pseudocyst in the head of the condyle. There is medial beaking of the condyle. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. There is significantly decreased superior joint space.\n\nRight TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that appears to have lost more volume than the opposite side and is a little bit more narrow mediolaterally. Significant decreased vertical joint space is present. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2-3 mm.\n\nLateral cephalometric radiograph shows that B064 has a significantly retruded maxilla and particularly the mandible. She has a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 5 to 6 mm at the soft palate level and about 5 mm at the base of the tongue. She has a skeletal Class II relationship and an anterior open bite.\n\nBasic diagnoses for B064 would be as follows:\nBilateral TMJ severe arthritis and articular disc dislocations with severe deformation and nonreducing (probable AICR).\nMaxillary AP and posterior vertical hypoplasia.\nMandibular AP hypoplasia.\nClass II occlusion. High occlusal plane angle.\nOccluding only on the second molars bilaterally.\nHypertrophied turbinates with nasal airway obstruction. Decreased oropharyngeal airway. TMJ pain.\nHeadaches. Myofascial pain.\n\nRecommended treatment would be as follows:\n1. Presurgical orthodontics. a.\tAlign and level mandibular arch. b.\tAlign and level maxillary arch.\n2. CAT scan of jaws and jaw joints (TMJ Concepts protocol).\n3. Surgery. a.\tBilateral TMJ reconstruction with mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses. b.\tMultiple maxillary osteotomies to advance it in a counterclockwise direction. c.\tBilateral TMJ fat grafts (harvest from the abdomen). d.\tBilateral coronoidotomies. e.\tBilateral partial turbinectomies.\n4. Postsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion.\n\nB064 MRI\nLeft TMJ coronal view shows a condyle that has significant condylar resorption and destruction. There are also degenerative changes in the fossa. The lateral rim curves inferiorly about 2 or 3 mm. There is some fluid in the superior joint space. There may be discal tissue anterior to the condyle.\n\nRight TMJ condyle is a little bit wider in width, but still a lot of loss of vertical volume. There is less degeneration in the fossa on this side. The lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly about 2 mm. There may be a little fluid in this joint space as well.\n\nLeft TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that has undergone severe degenerative changes with loss of vertical volume. There is some mushrooming out of the condylar head. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced, severely degenerated and deformed, and extremely anteroposteriorly. There is degenerative changes in the fossa. The articular eminence is moderately steep. On opening, there is some restricted translation. The articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.\n\nRight TMJ sagittal view shows a condyle that similarly has undergone significant degenerative changes. The articular disc is anteriorly displaced, although in slightly better condition than the opposite side. The articular eminence has a moderate inclination. The fossa appears quite broad in width compared to the size of the condyle. The articular disc is significantly degenerated.

{"metadata": {"patient_id": "B372", "note_date": "unknown", "note_month": "Unknown"}, "original_note": "B372 \nB372 is 40 years old and is referred by Dr. _.\nPatient History\nB372 has had a previous laparoscopy 12 years ago. B372 is in good health except for her jaw problems. She was on WELLBUTRIN when she filled out the form, but it caused her to be jittery, and she since has discontinued it. She has had an adverse reaction to PENICILLIN. She apparently got hives in the past when she has taken penicillin.\n\nB372's problems began when she was about 14 or 15 years of age in reference to her TMJ problems. The etiology is unknown. She tolerated things fairly well, and in the past year-and-a-half she has really developed significant pain, headache, and dysfunction problems. She did finally get a splint this year, and the splint does help by reducing the pain. She chronically holds the lower jaw forward as it feels better in that position. If she goes back into a centric relation, she has severe pain. She has taken Vicodin occasionally but also has taken aspirin and Excedrin for migraines most of the time.\n\nPatient Concerns\nHeadaches that progress into migraines\nSevere pain in the TMJ joints\nDifficulties opening her jaws\nDifficulties eating and chewing\nTeeth and jaws don't fit together properly\nShe has to posture her jaw forward to try to achieve relief\nLower jaw is becoming progressively more retruded\nEaraches\nTinnitus\nFrequent vertigo\nHearing loss\nFrequently wakes up with headaches at least 50% of the time\nNighttime clenching and grinding of the teeth\nDaytime clenching\nNot sleeping well\nSnoring\nEven though she has been an aerobics instructor for years, lately she feels as though she gets out of breath just walking and can't catch her breath\nBreathlessness problems\nDifficulties breathing through her nose\nChronic fatigue\n\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, B372 has fairly good left-to-right facial symmetry. Upper lip length is about 24 mm. Upper tooth-to-lip relationship is about 2.5 mm. Maxillary midline is pretty much on the facial midline. Mandibular dental midline and chin are shifted to the right about 1 to 2 mm.\n\nIn profile view, B372 has fairly good balance between the upper lip, cheeks, and nose. Chin is retruded, and chin-neckline is short. Chin-neck angle is poorly defined. Chin is probably about 15 mm AP deficient. She does have some mild crenations on the tongue. Intraorally, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Some moderate crowding, lower anterior arch. Slight accentuated curve of occlusion, lower arch. In the upper arch, she has all of her teeth back through the second molars. Some mild crowding, upper anterior arch. B372 has a Class II occlusion. She has an overjet of probably about 4 mm. In manipulating her jaw back into a centric relation, it is quite uncomfortable for her. She is about 5 mm Class II bilaterally. Difficult to visualize the soft palate and uvula but was able to see it, and tissues look healthy. Transverse width of the oropharynx appears as though it could be somewhat narrow. Turbinates are moderately enlarged intranasally. She does have some constricture of the luminal valves.\n\nTo palpation, she does have some mild tenderness over the TMJs and styloid areas. All other areas are free of pain or discomfort. Maximal incisal opening is 48 mm. Excursive movements are 10 mm in each direction. She can fairly easily open up, but if she tries to go through repeated openings, it becomes quite painful for her to do that.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows crowns on the mandibular first molars, maxillary right first molar, and the tooth also has a root canal on it. Sinuses appear relatively clear. Difficult to evaluate turbinates. Condyles appear arthritic with the right side being worse than the left side. The right side appears as though it has an erosion in the center of it.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle with severe arthritis and significant anterior beaking present. Fossa has a moderate slope to it. The patient may not have been all the way back in centric relation with this radiograph, but nonetheless the condyle is quite arthritic in appearance.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram appears to be taken in more of a centric relation as compared to the opposite side. Decreased posterior joint space, and appears that there is a little osteophyte perhaps extending posteriorly off the condylar head that appears to almost touch against the posterior wall of the fossa. Articular eminence is of moderate inclination. Significant anterior beaking is present. Appears to be an erosion in the center of the condylar head.\n\nOpening views show fairly good translation of both condyles. The condyles are quite arthritic.\nWaters view shows that the sinuses appear fairly clear with the left one being just a little bit more cloudy than the right side. Ethmoid and frontal sinuses look clear. Turbinates appear to fill a good part of the nasal cavity.\n\nCephalometrically, B372 has a Class II skeletal relationship. She has a high occlusal plane angle. Oropharyngeal airway actually looks not as bad as one might expect. Airway at the soft palate level is about 7 mm and at the base of the tongue is about 8 mm. She has posterior vertical maxillary deficiency. On the lateral ceph, her head is tipped upwards which will increase the airway. B372 has an aunt and her dad who have severe arthritic problems in multiple joints. No significant tooth-size discrepancy is present.\n\nBasic Diagnoses\nBilateral TMJ severe reactive arthritis\nAP mandibular deficiency\nPosterior vertical maxillary deficiency\nClass II occlusion\nHigh occlusal plane angle\nMild crowding, lower anterior arch\nMild crowding, upper anterior arch\nAP microgenia\nHypertrophied turbinates\nNasal airway obstruction\nDecreased oropharyngeal airway dimension\nSevere TMJ pain\nSevere headaches\nEaraches Tinnitus\nVertigo\nHearing loss\n\nRecommended Treatment\nPresurgical orthodontics Align and level maxillary arch Align and level mandibular arch\nCT scan of TMJs and jaws (TMJ Concepts protocol)\n\nSurgery\nBilateral TMJ reconstruction and mandibular advancement with TMJ Concepts total joint prostheses\nBilateral TMJ fat grafts\nBilateral coronoidectomies\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to downgraft the posterior aspect and upright the incisors\nHTR implant to anterior mandible\n\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion\nOther Systems\nB372 does have problems with her hips and knees. She has never had any urinary tract infections, but she does have polyuria; however, she drinks a lot of water. When she has her period, she has excessive pain. She has had two children, ages 14 and 16, and no miscarriages. She was diagnosed as having endometriosis when she was younger and was told she wouldn't be able to have children. She has had lots of problems with ovarian cysts. She had pelvic inflammatory disease x 1. She had an abnormal Pap smear once, and she had cryosurgery, and this was at the age of 37. She used to have problems with vaginal yeast infections with the use of panty hose, but she doesn't wear those anymore and no longer has a problem. She had gingivitis x 1. She does have earaches, tinnitus, vertigo, and has loss of hearing. No known STDs. She is tired a lot. She gets palpitations of her heart during her periods. For about a year-and-a-half recently, they had three parakeets. One of them died. Her sister has two love birds and a parrot that she spends a fair amount of time with. She has had a cat for about a year. They have had guinea pigs in the past. She has had several outside dogs.\n\nB372 MRI Evaluation \nDate of Acquisition:\t\nDate of Reading: \nLeft TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears to have undergone some significant condylar resorption. Cortical bone may not be intact all the way across. The superior cortex looks a little raggedy. Fossa appears a little bit rough but could be just the quality of the MRI. Significantly decreased joint space vertically. Mild downward curvature of the lateral rim of the fossa. Discal tissue not identifiable.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle that appears to have significant arthritis associated with it. Condyle looks quite sclerotic and appears as though there has been significant resorption. Condyle very narrow mediolaterally. This joint may have had previous surgery. Lateral rim of the fossa curves inferiorly quite significantly, and it appears as though there is reactive bone extending down from the lateral rim of the fossa. Bone in the fossa looks fairly thin.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that is narrow anteroposteriorly. Appears to have lost a lot of vertical height and volume of the condyle. Significant anterior beaking is present. May be some discal tissue anteriorly but appears to be fairly degenerated. Decreased vertical joint space. Could possibly be some erosions even in the fossa articular eminence area but difficult to verify. Discal tissue definitely is anteriorly displaced.\n\nOn opening, there is fairly good translation of the condyle, and it appears that the remnant of the discal tissue remains anteriorly displaced.\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has undergone severe condylar resorption with loss of vertical height and anteroposterior dimension. Significant anterior beaking or osteophytic formation in the front. Some cratering out of the condylar head toward the medial side. Appears to be some remnant of discal tissue sitting beneath the articular eminence. May be erosions in the fossa area.\n\nOn opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle as it comes down beneath the articular eminence, but the remnant of the articular disc remains anteriorly displaced without reduction.\n\nImpression:\nLeft TMJ severe arthritis with articular disc dislocation with severe deformation and nonreducing\nRight TMJ severe arthritis with articular

The disc is not really seen toward the lateral aspect but is more visible toward the medial aspect of the joint. Medially the disc appears to be in reasonable position. Out laterally, it could be anteriorly displaced and possibly medially displaced as well. The lateral aspect of the condyle seems to have fairly good form. Articular eminence is moderately steep. There is some flattening of the head of the condyle over medially.\n\nOn opening, there is moderately good translation of the condyle, and the articular disc is in position. At the most lateral aspect the disc is not as readily identifiable as it is medially.\n\nIn one view, it appears the disc does move some as compared to the right side.\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows a condyle that has more of a hockey stick shape to it than the opposite side. A little bit of flattening on the anterior head. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Decreased posterior joint space. Articular disc out laterally is anteriorly displaced. In one area it appears it may be acting as a wedge pushing the condyle posteriorly. More medially, the disc may be in a little bit better position. Out laterally, it appears to be in a little bit more of a vertical position and may be pushing the condyle posteriorly as there is a slightly decreased joint space posteriorly.\n\nOn opening, there is moderate translation, but the condyle appears to move significantly better than the disc does.

He takes Lortab 10. He generally takes 3 in the morning and 3 at night, and this keeps him out of the severe pain cycles. He also takes Elavil 50 mg, he takes 1 at night, Depakote 250 mg, 2 tablets in the morning and 2 tablets at night. has had an allergic reaction to CLEOCIN.\n\nB237's headaches are worse in the evenings, and he generally feels better in the mornings. He is not aware of any problems and bruxism. He gets no earaches, gets occasional tinnitus, no vertigo, and no hearing loss. Other joints that bother him include his left wrist, which he injured and required surgery from a motorcycle accident. Also, his knees bother him at times. gets headaches that are primarily in the frontal and temporal area, but they can cover the entire head at times. The average intensity is about a level of 6, but they can escalate almost everyday to a level of 10. He is not aware of any specific pain in the TMJ area with normal daily activity. His average daily pain is about a level of 6. He rates his jaw function at 3, diet at 2, and disability at 9. B237's problems began about five years ago. Actually, about a year prior to that he had a motorcycle accident where he had a concussion and was knocked out. Five years ago he had his third molars removed in the morning and went out riding his motorcycle that afternoon and had another wreck and knocked himself out again. He was taken to the hospital, and they performed a CAT scan at that time. estimates that the time of unconsciousness was about 10 to 12 seconds. His helmet was cracked in the second accident. About three days after that accident is when his headaches began. He woke up three days later with a fairly significant headache and essentially has been there since that time. Since that time, he has been evaluated by a neurologist, Dr. _____, and he has had CAT scans and MRIs 5 years ago and last year. The only thing they found was an enlarged pituitary gland but didn't feel that it was of any significance. They found nothing else. He has had acupuncture x six treatments (no help), biofeedback x 30 treatments (no help), chiropractic treatment (no help), left and right occipital nerve blocks and facet blocks (no help), massage therapy (no help), exercise (no help), and bite splint for one year (no help). He has been on lots of medications including Wellbutrin, Toradol, Paxil, beta blockers, etc. None of these has been effective in eliminating 's problems. He has even been on Elavil and Depakote for about three years I believe and became ineffective for him. He has only been on Lortab 10 for about the last three months. He has been having to go to the ER to get his medications. I will go ahead and give him medication. I did tell him that I am not a long-term pain management doctor and that I will take care of him for a little while here, but then if we have no resolution or if decides not to proceed on with treatment, will refer him to Dr. ____for pain management. Gave a prescription for Lortab 10, disp. 60 tablets, 3 tablets in the a.m., 3 tablets in the p.m. with no refills.\n\nClinical Examination\nIn frontal view, has good facial symmetry and balance. He has basically a Class I cuspid-molar relationship. A little bit of malalignment of his anterior upper teeth and some mild crowding, lower anterior teeth. He has about 2 to 3 mm of overbite.\n\nTo palpation, has moderate pain over the temporalis muscles, TMJs, and milder discomfort over the styloid areas, SCMs, posterior neck, shoulders, and very minimal tenderness over the masseter muscles. On opening, he has a loud audible pop in the right joint at 30 mm of opening and a closing click at 10 mm which is also audible. On excursive movements, he has an audible and palpable click in the right joint. The left joint seems to function reasonably smoothly. The disc may be in a pre-click position. is not aware of ever having his jaw joints injected.\n\nRadiographic Evaluation\nPanorex shows the absence of all four third molars with all the rest of the teeth being present. Sinuses look clear. Turbinates look relatively normal in size. Styloid processes appear fairly long on both sides and relatively thin. They appear to overlap the posterior border of the mandible. Condyles both look a little bit flat on the anterior aspect but otherwise look pretty much okay.\n\nWaters view shows that the sinuses appear to be clear. Nasal airway appears very good. Some slight deviation of the nasal septum but not too significantly. No other significant findings.\n\nRight TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that has a slight hockey stick shape to it. Joint space appears fairly well-balanced. Articular eminence is moderately steep.\n\nLeft TMJ tomogram shows a condyle that is hard to see the top of and appears quite flattened across the top. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Appears to be an increased vertical joint space.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of both condyles with the right one exhibiting a little bit better translation than the left side.\nCephalometrically, has a good Class I skeletal and occlusal relationship.

Some adenoid tissue still remaining in the nasopharynx area. Oropharyngeal airway measures about 6 mm at the soft palate level and about 9 mm at the base of the tongue. Has hyperfunction of the mentalis muscle forcing her lips closed. B375 does snore at times when she is sleeping. The parents note that when they do go in and observe her sleeping that if she is not grinding her sleep, she is sleeping with her mouth fairly wide open. There is a tooth-size discrepancy of about 2 mm. There is also a slight tooth-size discrepancy in the bicuspid area of probably about 0.5 mm with each tooth, although this can work in our favor. With the tooth-size discrepancy, it tends to allow B375 to be in a Class I cuspid relationship, but as we get close to the molars, the molars are in a little bit more of a Class II end-on relationship.\n\nBasic Diagnoses\nBilateral TMJ arthritis and articular disc dislocations (rule out idiopathic condylar resorption)\nAnterior vertical maxillary excess\nPosterior vertical maxillary deficiency\nAP mandibular deficiency\nAP microgenia\nTooth-size discrepancy with a Bolton's difference of 2 mm\nTooth-size discrepancy in the bicuspid area with the lower bicuspid being about 0.5 mm larger than the upper bicuspids\nClass I cuspid relationship but Class II end-on molar relationship due to tooth-size discrepancy Moderate crowding, lower anterior arch\nHigh occlusal plane angulation\nImpacted maxillary and mandibular third molars x 4\nLack of attached gingiva around the lower anterior arch (could possible require some gingival grafting to provide quality attached gingiva) Headaches TMJ pain\nMyofascial pain\nWide columella base creating narrow nostrils\nConstricture of intranasal luminal valves\nNasal airway obstruction\nPredominant mouth breather\n\nRecommended Treatment\nSurgery, Stage I\nBilateral TMJ articular disc repositioning and ligament repair with Mitek anchors\nReconstruction of columella Bilateral reconstruction of nasal luminal valves with placement of stents\nConsider small chin augmentation of 5 mm\n\nOrthodontics\nAlign and level maxillary arch\nAlign and level mandibular arch. Strip lower anterior teeth removing 2 mm of tooth structure. Also, strip lower bicuspids removing 0.5 mm of tooth structure from each four lower bicuspids and retract maximizing posterior anchorage\n\nSurgery, Stage II\nMultiple maxillary osteotomies to move the anterior aspect superiorly, posterior aspect inferiorly, and advance it\nBilateral mandibular ramus osteotomies to advance the mandible in a counterclockwise direction\nSurgical removal of four bony impacted third molars\n\nPostsurgical orthodontics to refine occlusion\nB375 MRI Evaluation \nDate of Acquisition:\t\nDate of Reading:\t\nLeft TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with good mediolateral width. Decreased joint space at the lateral aspect. Discal tissue seen to be medially displaced. Cortical bone appears to be intact over the top of the condyle. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.\n\nRight TMJ, coronal view, shows a condyle with fairly good mediolateral width. Some depression in the superior cortex. Decreased vertical joint space. Appears that there may be some discal tissue medially. Condyle must be angled significantly in three different views. Lateral rim of the fossa is fairly flat.\n\nLeft TMJ, sagittal view, shows some flattening of the anterior head of the condyle and some anterior beaking present. Articular eminence is moderately steep. Out laterally, the disc is not as well seen. The disc is in a vertical orientation between the condyle and fossa and is displaced anteriorly. May be some inflammation in the bilaminar tissues and a little bit of fluid in the inferior joint space.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of the condyle, and the disc does reduce and translates reasonably well also.\nRight TMJ, sagittal view, shows there is significant anterior beaking of the condyle. Articular eminence is steep and extremely long in vertical length particularly out laterally. Decreased vertical joint space. Disc is anteriorly displaced particularly toward the lateral aspect of the joint. More medially, the disc appears that it may be in a little bit better position. There does not appear to be a significant inflammatory process in this joint.\n\nOn opening, there is good translation of the condyle, and the disc appears to reduce on opening and also translates fairly well itself.\nImpression:\nLeft TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced with reduction\nRight TMJ arthritis and articular disc anteriorly and medially displaced with reduction", "original": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 12, \"diet_score\": 0, \"disability_rating\": 6, \"jaw_function_score\": 1, \"neck_pain_present\": true, \"onset_triggers\": \"chewing gum\", \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"three to four times per week\", \"muscle_pain_score\": \"mild\", \"headache_location\": \"temporal\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 5, \"headache_intensity\": \"5 | present\", \"pain_onset_date\": \"one year ago\", \"tmj_pain_rating\": 0, \"sleep_disorder_type\": \"snoring\", \"current_medications\": \"adderall xr\", \"disc_displacement\": \"left disc anterior and medial displacement with reduction | right disc anterior and medial displacement with reduction | left disc dislocation | right disc dislocation\", \"muscle_pain_location\": \"temporalis | masseters | styloids | scms | posterior neck | shoulders | medial pterygoids\", \"joint_arthritis_location\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"joint_pain_areas\": \"tmj | left tmj | right tmj\"}}", "prediction": "{\"extraction\": {\"patient_age\": 12, \"maximum_opening\": \"54mm\", \"diet_score\": 0, \"disability_rating\": 6, \"jaw_function_score\": 1, \"tinnitus_present\": false, \"vertigo_present\": false, \"hearing_loss_present\": false, \"jaw_clicking\": \"left tmj | right tmj\", \"airway_obstruction_present\": true, \"headache_frequency\": \"three to four times per week\", \"average_daily_pain_intensity\": 5, \"headache_location\": \"temporal | posterior neck | medial pterygoids | styloids | scm | masseters | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | styloids | bicuspids | bicuspids | bite | bite | overjet | crossbite | anterior open bite | posterior open bite | anterior open bite | posterior open bite | anterior open bite | posterior open bite | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj | right tmj | left tmj |"}
